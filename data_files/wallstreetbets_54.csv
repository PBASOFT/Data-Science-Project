100,gzsrwtw,2021-05-28 20:15:45,t1_gzsrwtw,t1_gzskrte,wallstreetbets,"Well if you go on YouTube and search ‚Äústock options trading guide‚Äù you can probably find some people who can explain it to you on video and if you have any questions or are confused still after watching some guides, investopedia is a great site for learning too. 

Basically you have to understand how ‚Äúthe Greeks‚Äù work (look up that term on investopedia) before you even consider buying an option. A quick rundown on some of them is that IV (inherent volatility) has a huge influence on how expensive or cheap an option will be at the moment you buy it. The more volatile the stock is, the more each option is worth. So ideally you will want to buy when the volatility is relatively low so you can buy for cheaper. Another big factor is Theta. The sooner the option is set to expire, the higher the theta will become. Basically, options become more expensive the further out your strike price is. If you buy an option that expires a year from now, it will be way more expensive than buying one that expires next week. This can work in your favor, but it can also fuck you in the ass. If you buy a call option that expires a month from now with a strike price of say 30$, but it takes a full month for the stock price to reach 30$, even though your call option might seem like a success, theta (time decay) will ruin the price of your contract and you might lose money even though the stock reached your strike price, because basically it didn‚Äôt reach your target fast enough.

Generally speaking, most people don‚Äôt execute their options, they just sell them back to the market once they‚Äôve gone up in value. It‚Äôs actually uncommon for people to buy a call option with the intention of actually using them to buy shares.

It‚Äôs a lot to take in and it‚Äôs not as simple as betting that the stock will reach a certain price and making money once it does. The prices of options can change wildly throughout the day as the IV changes (along with the stock price).

If you are having trouble timing your entries/exits on just buying and holding shares, you‚Äôll have an insanely hard time timing options correctly. 

I am still learning the flow of options trading myself so currently I only have 1 single contract open right now. If it falls through and expires worthless then I lose 100$. I already know I messed up on timing my entry but it doesn‚Äôt expire till august so I still have time to bail on it and sell at a slight loss, or get lucky and make a little money. You definitely won‚Äôt be seeing huge gains from options until you really really understand how they work. So yeah, watch as many YouTube tutorials and if you have any questions at all just research research research until you‚Äôre confident with the knowledge you gained, and then MAYBE buy ONE single option contract to test the waters.",,

I'm pretty high conviction on this, I don't do options anymore, because my time is awful, but I've held SPXS 3x bear for SPY all week and I'm down like 3% on that play, stop loss is about 2 - 3 % away if I'm wrong. Upside, if I'm right (SPY goes down next two months) then I'm looking at probably 50% gains. This is how I'm playing these markets from now on, super patient for really good opportunities that don't stress me out, even if they're inching more and more towards me being wrong.

My crayon drawn lines tell me I'll be right though, and very soon. If we pop the old highs by more than 1% or so, then I'm out with a small loss, and look for a new opportunity (probably NUGT, again, made 33% on that just a couple weeks back with like a 5% ""risk"" with my stop loss.

Are you referring to the hedge funds?  If so, they shorted stocks. That is they borrowed shares of stock, and sold them. They are responsible for returning the same number of stock shares, no matter what the price is.  So let's say they borrowed 100 million shares at $4 and sold them, they have $400 million. They are gambling that the price of the stocks will go down.  No matter what the cost of the stock, they owe 100 million shares to the people they borrowed it from. So if the price of the stock goes down to $3 a share, they give the hundred million shares back at a cost of $300 million, and get to pocket the other $100 million.  

So now let's say the stock goes up in value, if their shares are called, they have to return that quantity of shares no matter what the cost is. A bunch of people buy into the stock, and hold the stock, and are unwilling to sell it, the price goes way up.  So if the price is now $400 a share, they still owe 100 million shares of stock to the entity they borrowed them from. No they have to buy those hundred million shares at $40 billion dollars and return them. 

Hopefully all my math is correct and that explanation.",,

The stock has been under heavy attack from shorts & MM. Still struggling to break $3 despite having a catalogue of M&A worthy of at least 3x the current buy price. Wanna hear your thoughts and potential PT for 2021-2022

Hear me out the recent M&A includes

- WAVE charging
- Energica Motor Company
-Medici Motor Works (MMW)
-Mobile Energy Global (MEG)
- Treelektrik
- Timios Title & Escrow Services
- DBOT
-Solectrac
- Silk EV
- Intelligenta

Recent blowout earnings revenue increasing 8500% YOY to $32M. With $355 mil cash on hand for more M&A. For me this stock will blow in 2021-2022. Analysts have issued a PT of $7. My PT is at least $10 EOY. 

CEO Alf Poor has likened the companies prospects to the android of EV where Tesla is Apple. For sure, they're going in the right direction but it seems it needs a hand with regards to investor exposure.

However, like many of you, I've started to wonder where my next meal of tendies will come from... and I think they just might come from Outer Space.

I already made a few schekels scalping some OTM calls on SPCE earlier this week playing the successful flight and launch and then came across this little diddy. 

[https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/ufos-are-make-way-us-senate-know-rcna973](https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/ufos-are-make-way-us-senate-know-rcna973)

It seems as though the US government (Intelligence Agencies) are going to release very soon, everything that they know about... UFO's and Aliens. 

I've been thinking about playing it with Space stocks like MAXR, LMT, SPCE, BA and others. I've been watching MAXR since it shat the bed after earnings and it has been up every day since... I wonder if it is in preparation for the release?

In all seriousness, does anyone think this might be something to ""Explore?""

TLDR: Alien report will be released by US government shortly. Mass tendies from Outer Space? Space stocks may already be in rally mode in anticipation.

The above link is what I said 2 days ago. At the time EXPI was hovering around $28.50 and since then it has shot up to about $32.27 on what appears to be about average volume for the stock. 

I still think they are going to have a huge share buyback of over 14m shares (their buyback program was increased from 75m to 475m) in stock and add to the insider owned shares which is now at 54.80% over the week it has gone up about 2%. Which is a bullish signal. If 14m shares were bought that would leave about 51m shares to be traded publicly and the insider owned share percentage would go to about 62% which would be a large driving factor in the price going up due to scarcity. Also the buyback would be large enough to trigger a massive buy and I would jizz my pants.",nmnbfw,*UPDATE* Why I still Think EXPI Is Going To $60 In 4-6 Weeks (up 10.59% this week)

[When we last left our hero,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrly28/the_legend_of_utheemperorofjenks_aka_ornamental/) he had just lost all of his rent money and what he could advance from credit cards on a failed Super Bowl bet, and a YOLO on ‚ÄúRhodium‚Äù that he ordered from a sketchy Slovakian Wish.com ripoff. Alas, it was, of course, fake, and he was broke and depressed. It might have been the first fatal case of autism. He thought to himself ‚ÄúAm I really that retarded?‚Äù Then, he realized ‚ÄúNo, it must be Oklahoma that‚Äôs retarded!‚Äù

So, [after a brief case of violent diarrhea from Oklahoma Grocery Store sushi](https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/lrslbb/psa_do_not_eat_grocery_store_sushi_right_now/), he was ready to hatch his plan! Uruguay! Yes, Uruguay. [He was going to move to Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lh5igx/c%C3%B3mo_se_puede_llegar_a_melo_desde_montevideo_sin/)

His plans for this move could‚Äôve been anyone‚Äôs guess. One possibility he inquired about was [how to be a Tea Blendmaster.](https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/lfga0m/how_does_one_become_a_blendmaster/) [Another was him possibly reconnecting with God.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/lsij6j/agnostic_jew_seeking_faith_in_god/) Yet, he seemed to be asking questions about another topic more often than the others...

[Bees.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lxcnt1/c%C3%B3mo_es_la_legalidad_de_la_apicultura_informal/)

Specifically, beekeeping, a topic he admitted he had no experience in, [as evident from him looking for any book on the subject as an introduction months before.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/)

What he planned on doing with the bees was anyone‚Äôs guess, and I doubt he thought it through that much either. One post **AFTER** he took possession of 200,000 bees (we‚Äôll get to that later,) was [asking Americans if there was a demand for mead in the states.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/) So, was he thinking of importing Uruguayan honey to the US to be made into mead? Was he going to make it himself? Did he move to another continent for no reason? Let‚Äôs all find out!

A little more than 2 months ago, he finally did it. [He moved to Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/m9ejpn/la_paloma/) And about a week after that, [he was driving a truck filled with 200k bees across his new country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/) Based on replies in that thread, he was aiming to have [a monopoly on beekeeping in the country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/gt48gke/)

Life was good.

But, trouble was afoot. According to a reply, [the species he was planning on keeping had literally never been kept by keepers in Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mtkkf3/about_to_upsize_my_apiary_whats_the_best_layout/gv0viej/) And then, disaster struck. [He went to TIFU to post his tale of spreading an invasive species in an industry he knew nothing about.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/nmd69k/tifu_by_importing_bees_to_uruguay/)

Indeed, he had no idea even what a bee was until he stumbled his way through a book, and then decided to YOLO into honey in Uruguay. He somehow got in touch with an ecology professor in Montevideo that would help him set things up in exchange for grad students fucking with them every now and again. Oh, and the bees were from fucking Myanmar. Handshake agreement, of course. Total Chad move.

And like I said before, the rest went without incident for a while. It would take the bees ‚Äúa year‚Äù to make honey, so he just kinda hung out, stayed busy, and tried to find part time work in a foreign country he arrived in 2.5 months earlier.

And then, the professor ghosted him. Just disappeared. Shortly thereafter, government agents come out about this kid from Oklahoma illegally importing a non-native bee to their country. Apparently his bees had been fucking with other apiaries. So, he did probably the smartest thing he‚Äôs ever done.

He ran.

He fucking ran from the Uruguayan government, took a plane to LAX, and arrived with $14 to his name. His friend sent him $100, which wasn‚Äôt enough to go back to Oklahoma, so he took a $75 flight to Seattle, where he is also not from.

His last post is from a train out of the airport, with $39 to his name. I don‚Äôt know what is in store for him, but I know that $39 is as good as spent on urchin futures or whatever market he‚Äôs going to crash up there.

1171,,2021-05-28 03:12:37,t3_nmofz4,,wallstreetbets,"This started as a comment reply but I thought maybe people would like reading it. I've been researching Palantir since literally late November 2020 and I have nearly my entire portfolio in LEAPS expiring January 2023. So I have continually done more research on them this is just the basics to clear up confusion and help people who don't understand it because it's hard to hear all the hype and stuff. Also AMC to the moon tomorrow for my FDs I bought!! Don't judge me it's just fun to be in on the action on weeks like this.


So you should think of palantir as basically three companies and they actually are very far from unprofitable. 

They developed the really massive government software (gotham) specifically as a result of an interaction that happened to Peter Thiel while he was at paypal. They were losing millions to foreign scammers at paypal and the solution ended up being a high quality algorithm that flagged the most likely scam transactions and then allowed analysts to efficiently double check and verify the real scam transactions.

 It essentially was using what computers are efficient at (sorting through massive amounts of data) and then combining that with what humans are good at (looking at the more complex nuances that at least at that point computer algorithms were incapable of doing) and augmenting the humans ability to make complex decisions by rapidly sorting through the incoming data and bringing everything good to their attention.

They fixed paypals using this method and literally made the company profitable overnight because of fixing how much they were losing in the scam transactions. The FBI contacted PayPal and Thiel about using that initial software. That was literally his inspiration for what would become Palantir. He goes over it in huge detail in his book zero to one. If you make an audible account you can read it for free and find the chapter I'm talking about.

Then for 15 years they perfected the government software into the absolute nearly monopoly it is now in government intelligence augmentation software. The whole time though they reinvested almost everything for the last 10 years into building the commercial software (Foundry). That side of the business has only been live for a VERY short time and initially they literally didn't spend a single dollar on marketing their first commercial clients sought THEM out because of their insane reputation with the government. Foundry helps with supply chains and all kinds of other important data  insights. But if you want a recent example the NIH and the NHS both used Foundry to figure out how to best distribute the vaccine and vaccine distribution in the US and Britain has far outpaced expectations. You think commercial companies aren't going to be interested in using the software that was literally proven on a level like that?

 They're only just now adding huge amounts of people to their sales teams literally in the last six months which if you read Peter thiels book is insane for the stock because they have this crazy long term plan and he literally talks about how when they get to a certain point and start adding sales as a full sector of the company it means that is the company the company plans to BEGIN scaling. Meaning they're this big and they literally only just started on the scaling part. Which they've also said in tons of interviews if you're a die hard Palantirian like me. 



They actually also have the third side of the  business which is their actual like full AI for weaponization and war and defense for the government. Gotham is like helping analysts and commanders lead and even helping police or agents figure out what's going on. This other software is different. It's called Apollo and its only at the beginning too. It's like pure AI machine learning AI handles everything stuff. Go find a video called pentagon head of NSC briefs public on AI I think it's on the PBS channel on YouTube or some shit. Or you can listen to Joe Biden talk about how we're going to double our percentage of gdp spending on AI. The amount of government money that's going to go into AI as a weapon to compete with China DWARFS peoples expectations of how much large the market for the kind of software palantir makes is. 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201001005334/en/U.S.-Army-Research-Lab-Selects-Palantir-Technologies-Inc.-for-91M-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-Development

This is literally the backbone of everything AI that the government is about to invest in. Sure they're going to experiment with other research but if you do research you'll also find Palantir is the ONLY company that does anything remotely like this software that has anywhere near the kind of clearances like what is required for these contracts. They are currently a clearance level 5 and about to be the highest 6. The closest competitors are almost all a 3 or lower I'm not even sure if there's more than a single 4 and that stuff is crazy hard to get. 

But like again I'm an obsessive. I realize why people get so excited about the commercial side scaling and how it's very possible and can make them huge and it will. But I'm actually pretty sure the reason people like Cathy Wood has such a huge boner for them is that she realizes how MASSIVELY. And I mean MASSIVELY underestimated the amount of government revenue they will get from all this AI investing the United States and NATO are about to do. It's literally the next Manhattan project and they're absolutely going to be one of the biggest players developing it if not the biggest. I think it's funny because most people are pretty disinterested in the government stuff for Palantir but i really think the weaponized AI apollo stuff may be as big as anything could ever be. 




Also people got the insider selling stuff very very wrong. Tom Nash (love him or hate him I don't care) has a few really good recent videos where he explains it in basically full detail what was happening. The selling panicked a lot of retail investors during a time when the buying for growth markets had really slowed because of rate hike due to inflation scares and a ton of retail holders got scared and caused more selling and more people got scared because of that and sold and it really just was mass psychology in effect and a LOT of FUD and confusion. 

Basically a few executives karp in particular got billions of dollars worth of options that vest but literally expire so you have to exercise them which means you buy shares of the company at a strike price. Well because it's the company granting shares the strike price is literally 10 cents or something and these automatically have to vest at quarterly increments. So everytime karp was exercising he's actually buying shares. Like over 150 million in total maybe a lot more million SHARES not dollars. shares. And even those when he exercising he's buying shares technically from the company it ALL counts as profit on taxes and ITS NOT LONG TERM CAP GAINS ELIGIBLE. So over the last year plus this year he's essentially getting shares but the literal dollar value of those shares to the government counts as pure profit. So his total income which he's getting taxed at 40% of is in the BILLIONS yes billions. Because that's a lot to handle people that work for them actually automatically schedule sells of shares to cover the taxes so that there's no issue it's not even like him saying sell today and they do this.... TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INSIDER SELLING TO THE SEC. That's why it's automatically happening so no one can ever claim he's timing it. 

So listen cause here's where it gets important. The exercising of the shares counts as almost pure profits but remember he's receiving SHARES not dollars he doesn't actually get billions of dollars. So has to then sell SOME of the shares so he can pays taxes on that. Then when he sells the shares to pay the taxes for exercising he actually owes even more money if they went up from when he exercised. So everytime he's selling low its actually good for him because it's less ADDITIONAL PROFIT that he would owe taxes on.

 If he wasn't selling its because he thought it would go down even further and then he would actually owe less taxes overall. So if he thought it was going to tank he'd wait and actually get a nice fat discount on his taxes. 

I know this seems really crazy but I promise that's how it works you can look it up in detail but yeah shocking that mainstream media and redditors/youtubers who barely do research and have no real understanding of how these billion dollar compensations work would get it wrong. Unbelievable I know. If he had actually sold the massive overall percentage of his shares that some people claim he did the company would be at like $3-6 dollars not low 20s. Retail got confused because of market pressured due to interest rate fears from inflation and sold low (like retail always does) to institutions.",nmofz4,"Palantir DD if you want to understand company and it's history better (also insider ""selling"" explained in detail)"

What is Blue Apron?


Blue Apron (NYSE: APRN) was the forgotten step child, bad luck Brian, IPO of summer 2017 that priced below range and had the misfortune of debuting after Amazon bought Whole Foods. Since it‚Äôs debut, the stock has suffered dropping from nearly $150 per share (adjusted for a 2019 reverse-split necessitated to stay listed) to as low as approximately $2.00!


Why the Drop?


Management. Fucking. Sucked. The prior executive team essentially handed Chad Hello Fresh the keys to the kingdom, when they made the fatal error of betting that the ‚Äúhigh affinity core users‚Äù would be enough to sustain the business. For this reason, they cut marketing to nearly nothing and attempted to realize operating leverage by shrinking the customer base only to its most prolific buyers.

This was stupid. HelloFresh did the opposite, essentially giving away meals, and they used it to stockpile market share. Put a chart up of HelloFresh customers against Blue Apron. You‚Äôll see the two lines converge and a clear indication that HelloFresh stole most of their business. HelloFresh was one of the best trades of the past 5 years. Look at the chart, look at the sales, and look at the margins. They have managed to achieve operating leverage by employing affordable pricing and emphasizing retention.


Blue Apron Might Go Under....


Today the company is in a dire place. Languishing away in Micro Cap hell at an $80M market cap, no one on Wall Street wants to cover these guys. Only their bankers, CG and MS, write them research and neither are overly optimistic. They‚Äôre in a shit spot with a credit line that mandates they keep $15M cash at all times, and they keep their customer base above 300K (thus far, they‚Äôve struggled). They‚Äôre sitting on $29M and burn enough cash per Q that they might go below that $15M level (wouldn‚Äôt be a first). All signs are negative...


But I Think They Might Win


Blue Apron is under new management. Linda Kozlowski, is the former COO of ETSY and an ex-strategist at Alibaba. She believes HelloFresh did things right and she wants to right the ship. Her ballsy-ass plan is to ride the line on cash and go all in on customer growth. She realizes those customers are worth a lot more than income on the P&L, and that she needs to make the pot as big as she can. Thus far, it‚Äôs worked. Customers are up over 20% in the past two periods and retention rates are rising. We are seeing signs of operating leverage, and it opens a big possibility.


My Prediction

Management is buying shares. They know the company is not healthy. The only logic is that they have a plan that‚Äôs working. You can‚Äôt sell a dying business with a shrinking share, but you can certainly sell a growing community, that could be an accretive asset to a better capitalized entity. I think Linda is going either get the business in a position where it can refinance for better terms, or where it can be sold to create shareholder value via a strategic alternative.

If that happen, given this is priced for bankruptcy and ignored by the Street, the returns could easily reach the triple digits. I‚Äôm long and I plan to add on additional weakness.

Everyone is talking about how the squeeze didn't even happen and the shorts didn't cover yet. What I don't understand is why wouldn't that be possible? If short interest is 17%, so let's round up to about 100M shares. Today the volume traded was 700M shares. Couldn't 100M of those 700M have been the shorts covering? And if they didn't cover, today alone 700M shares were traded, why would 100M shares bought by shorts cause a squeeze if today 700M were traded?

I have been having this question for awhile, since I noticed the same with GME. In the days preceding January 28th (when GME reached its peak), the combined volume was several times the amount of float. How come the squeeze happened and why did it happen? If the volume was so high, couldn't the shorts have covered in the days preceding that?

I had a look at $BB and assume that we finally formed the bottom. In the last few days we saw a sharp rise which might continue in the next weeks. If we can break the 12$ resistance, the next targets would be aroung 25-28$. 

Using Elliot wave theory we are probably at the end of the correction wave 4 and now began with the bullish wave 5.

Price targets:

\#1 12$

\#2 25$

\#3 48$

The risk/reward is worth entering a trade here. I bought yesterday around 10$. My stop loss is below 8$.

1194,,2021-05-28 09:17:32,t3_nmtt43,,wallstreetbets,"Trainline has taken a huge dip since the UK government's announcement of the plan to nationalise the railway network. The plan includes creating an online ticketing platform by Great British Railways which might have a huge blow on Trainline revenue. However, this platform does not yet exist and will probably take a couple of years to develop. Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed.

In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales.  Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%.

I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time  for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

This is my first time making a post here, please do give constructive feedback and criticism.

1199,,2021-05-28 10:41:01,t3_nmuzzi,,wallstreetbets,"Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent of Modernas if not more. Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects) 

Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

Imagine if the spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize one piece to understand the whole picture it and helps modify your DNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates it can still recognize the virus. In contrast to using one portion of the picture as it mutates it's easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine, that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. Not only that but they have had the least amount of side effects of any covid vaccine deeming it the safest covid vaccine.... 

And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein (whole picture) and the safety profile. Also worth a mention is that you could store it in a regular refrigerator, and let it sit out in room temperature while you're vaccinating people instead of a special ultra low temp freeze needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers, this is a majority of the world. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines so other protein competitors will be far behind and they will have an a moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing they teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine. They will be combining flu and covid vaccine by 2025 for possibly double the price of current covid vaccine.

 They are pretty much de-risked at this point. Yes you could buy other  biotechs that can go up 20x but are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up) that has all successful trials done so far, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment to where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place there are no more glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""

They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. Yesterday at market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. 
 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

Future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract in there ( in the link below in another message). It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 

I own a lot of $250 July calls along with about 1k shares. I'm all in baby. LFG I expect to turn 200k into over a million in a year's time via shares and options

Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. This is huge as the combo is going to differentiate them especially since both flu and covid vaccines are first in class.

1) We look to the PTON CFO's statement found in the latest earnings call transcript, for guidance:
""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior.""
2) Being that we do not have access to a 10-K filing for Q4 fiscal '19, we will access other filings that do in fact reference numbers from fiscal '19...
A) 10-K filing dated 9/11/2020
B) 10-Q filing dated 5/6/2020
3) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $223.3M under Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19)
But, that is TOTAL Revenue; we need to find out what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike sales...
4) To calculate what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike Sales, we can use numbers from neighboring Q3 (i.e. Three Months Ended March 31, 2019)...
A) On page 6 of the 10-Q, you will find Revenue of ""Connected Fitness Products"" (aka Bike Sales) to be $261.6M
B) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $316.7M
C) % of Bike Sales per TOTAL Revenue: $261.6M / $316.7M * 100 = 82.6% {""Connected Fitness Products"" Revenue (aka Bike Sales)}
5) Apply 82.6% to the TOTAL Revenue $223.3M for Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19): $223.3M x 0.826 = $184.45M {Bike Sales for Q4 of fiscal '19}
6) Per the CFO, ""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior."":

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote... By mid-July, we‚Äôll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase precious metals  especially silver amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative 

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

Gold rose over 60% in the 1930s as the prices of stocks and real estate crashed. You could buy an entire block with a one ounce gold coin. Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms.

What most people do not realize is that driverless technology and such can be placed in Petro vehicles too). Also, unfortunately, the company has done a terrible marketting job. That's why powerful analysts can get away with making vague and unsupported statements. The fact that Cramer explained the stock's decrease over the last month as being due to widespread dissaproval is misleading, at best. Many people do not yet know about the cleanliness and therapeutic effects RNG has on the climate. We must get the word out and pressure CLNE corporate to begin marketting campaigns to get the word out. I think it's about time.",nn0whs,Cramer on CLNE

The News...

If you haven't read yet it looks like Federal Cannabis legalization my be around the corner. [Here](https://www.mpp.org/policy/federal/the-more-act/) is the House Bill. Supporters seem on board and like the reforms they have done to the bill including rescheduling cannabis. [Last time](https://mjbizdaily.com/key-us-house-lawmaker-reintroduces-federal-marijuana-legalization-bill/) the bill was introduced it cleared the House.   


Personally I think this gets a lot of support especially from a fiscal point of view. With stimulus stalling and a giant debate going on about how to pay for the stimulus I think cannabis offers the easiest way to collect federal revenue. A simple review of the bill and the fiscal benefits to the Fed's can be read [here](https://www.justtherealnews.com/congress/nadler-blumenauer-lee-jackson-lee-jeffries-velazquez-reintroduce-comprehensive-marijuana-reform-legislation/). The bill states a 5% fed tax. Money coming for uncle Sam, right when questions about paying for stimulus.... Personally I think it adds up, but that's for you to decide. 

Okay so that's the hype...

Let's talk about the tickers listed ($SNDL and $TLRY). 

$SNDL

I'll start with the cheaper YOLO, $SNDL. $SNDL short interest isn't high, but the company did issue convertible notes a while back around .7c if my memory is correct. I'm not saying they won't do it again, but they should be in a good place fiscally for now. Float is high with about 1.6B shares out there. However today's volume at the time of writing is over 415M. That's not bad given such a high float. It's about 200% more than the average volume. 

The options chain on $SNDL has me giddy. With over 200,000 options currently in the money on todays move above $1 there is some high potential here for some interesting action. The put to call ratio is just obnoxiously low at .08 it's screaming upwards betting. If we hold above $1 the potential squeeze up could be amazing.   


It's also broken up on the trend lines and out of the downward channel it was in. The regression channel from the peak squeeze back in Feb just broke out today according to my crayons I have laying around. 

$TLRY

$TLRY was the squeeze of a lifetime if you remember it back in 19'. The ticker was just a money printer with it's low float and stupid hype. Then they proceeded to do, like they all do, and issue debt. Shares tumbled since then falling from $120 --> $5. Ouch bag holders.   


Like all the cannabis stocks the Feb bump pushed $TLRY to above $60 in an amazing move. $TLRY has a lower short interest than $SNDL, but it also has a much lower float at about 300M. Compared to $SNDL the volume here isn't as good, but still remains decently above the avg volume around 36M as of right now. 

If we peep the options chain we also see a crazy low P/C ratio around .11. But we don't have the Open Interest in the chain like $SNDL does unless you roll out to Jun 18. Then we finally get some decent OI.   


Personally I am going with $SNDL. The option's chain looks better, the stock is cheaper, and the short interest is a little better. My advice would be to roll out till at least the Jun 11th $1 strike to not get eaten alive by Theta and IV crush. But WSB does what WSB wants and that's why I love you all.   
Do not go above the $2 strikes IMO. You will get crushed by theta unless we get an insane move, which could happen but I don't see the risk / reward there.",nn326f,MORE ACT / CANNABIS / $SNDL & $TLRY Potential

>A corner in the silver market has been tried before - and let's be clear, that is what is being attempted now.  In 1980, a rule change by the government destroyed the corner.  #silverthursday.

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday

>Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers‚Äô attempt to corner the market on the metal.

-
>Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926‚Äì2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers‚Äô Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.

-
>By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged‚ÄîMarch 27‚Äîsilver fell to $10.80, the metal‚Äôs biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, ‚ÄúA billion dollars isn‚Äôt what it used to be,‚Äù the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.

-
>To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978‚Äì91) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities.",nn36fw,There is no silver short squeeze happening.

* Henrik Fisker is a God among men in the automotive industry - trust him to do right
* Geeta Gupta-Fisker is a solid Chief Financial Officer with experience in investment banking - she will ensure the shares are valued right
* Henrik has learned from all the mistakes he made with his previous attempt to create Fisker Automotive, and will certainly do everything in his power to avoid that mess again. He has designed systems into the intricacies of the company to avoid failure - meaning Fisker Inc is guaranteed to succeed
* Henrik Fisker on shorting $FSR - ‚ÄúYou will quickly understand that you stand to lose a lot of money if you show it against Fisker‚Äù
* Production of Fisker Ocean expected to start in November 2022
* 250,000+ units a year expected by 2025
* Partnerships with Foxconn and Magna Steyr, both giants in their respective industries, among others
* Large Fleet market in Europe gaining momentum, and 700+ Fisker reservations in this market alone
* 16,000+ reservations already. More than Tesla had 18 months pre-production
* Revenue streams include leasing automotives, servicing, selling emissions credits, selling insurance (like selling the pickaxe to miners, and selling the diamonds to the mine owners too, absolutely genius - Fisker are insuring cars which they own, because the customer is only leasing it)
* High short interest (20%+), high analyst price targets compared to current share price (100%+) and low valuation compared to peers ($3bn market cap currently)
* Designing the first ever all-electric popemobile - Massive, soon to be historic, event!
* I give $FSR (currently $13 a share) a price target of $100 by end of year 2022, if not sooner
* Price Targets: $35 by end of year - Previous ATH. $50 start of next year - European and Chinese debut of prototypes. $100 end of 2022 - start of production (SOP). $150+ 2023
* 2025 Price Targets, calculated using projected data: Bear case - $97 a share, Bull case - $519 a share
* Downside in the short term is capped by the large amount of cash on hand - one third of market cap is cash. Long term, is capped by risk factors, which are almost eligible and affect every automotive startup anyway.

## Fisker Automotive

In 2008, Fisker Automotive raised over $90 million from investors including venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. In September 2009, Fisker Automotive was awarded a $528 million loan guarantee by the United States Department of Energy (DOE). The automaker was one of four recipients of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, to encourage the domestic manufacture of electric cars. The funds were to be used to develop the Karma, as well as an affordable family-size plug-in hybrid car. The loan facility was frozen at $192 million in February 2012, after the DOE claimed that Fisker missed its milestones

In December 2011, just as the Fisker Karma was launched, its battery supplier, A123 Systems, recalled all batteries, followed by a second recall in 2012. A123 filed for bankruptcy in October 2012, leaving Fisker Automotive without a battery supplier. After selling approximately 2,000 units, production of the Fisker Karma was suspended in November 2012, in the absence of its battery supplier.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/59vfj5wa8w171.png?width=511&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1c03d1e1254fea00c195776122de2b26099dd35

Henrik Fisker resigned as chairman from Fisker Automotive in March 2013, because of disagreements with management about business strategy. Later that year, the company declared voluntary bankruptcy.Fisker raised and spent more than a billion dollars over its lifetime.The heart of Fisker‚Äôs business model was in that early deal with Quantum. The idea was to design a gorgeous car, and have suppliers like Quantum provide the technology because off-the-shelf parts from suppliers would help keep costs down.

But there were problems with this strategy: Sometimes, those parts had to be custom-made to fit the design vision, which resulted in higher prices for Fisker. Other times, parts were delivered late or, worse, faulty, but Fisker was locked in to those supplier relationships. Sources close to Fisker have also said that many of the parts were owned by the suppliers themselves, so Fisker didn‚Äôt own a lot of the internal technology.

The broker that raised funds for Fisker automotive, by selling their private shares, was Advanced Equities.It wasn‚Äôt until December 2011 and into 2012 that the more dubious efforts of Advanced Equities became clearer to Fisker‚Äôs hundreds of investors. The last few hundred million dollars of Advanced Equities‚Äô fund raising for Fisker, starting with the D-1 round, was what brokers call ‚Äúpay to play.‚Äù As Fisker was running into technical, delivery and political problems, its valuation was quickly declining. But the company still needed more money, so the brokers went back to its current investors and said: Unless you give this more, your current shares will be diluted and your preferred stock will be converted to common stock.

It was essentially a gun to their heads. This is why investor Wray sued Fisker in February 2012, alleging he was on the receiving end of this tactic. In his lawsuit, he says Advanced Equities sent him a letter dated Jan. 18, 2012, stating that he needed to decide if he wanted to invest in Fisker‚Äôs next round, and pay around $84,000 by Jan. 27, 2012 ‚Äî a little over a week from receiving the letter. He also says that Advanced Equities assured him that he would have anti-dilution protection. According to the audio clip from Advanced Equities‚Äô internal sales call in early 2010, Advanced Equity leaders say that the Fisker deal will ‚Äúsuffer no dilution,‚Äù and was ‚Äúa dream scenario.‚Äù

That dream would soon end. In September 2012 after Fisker closed on $1.2 billion in funding, the bulk of it organized by Advanced Equities, the SEC charged the broker with misleading investors when it raised money for another company back in 2009 and 2010 (Bloom Energy). Advanced settled, agreeing to pay $1 million, and its co-founders were personally fined. Two months later Advanced Equities closed up shop.

Later, A123 Systems itself went bankrupt, causing more problems for Fisker. Fisker claimed that A123 Systems owed it $140 million, but a bankruptcy settlement reduced that to a paltry $15 million.

Then there was the just plain terrible luck for the ironically named Karma: Super Storm Sandy wiped out 338 of its Karmas in storage in New Jersey. The cars first drowned, and then caught on fire ‚Äî salt water damage caused a short circuit that was spread to other cars by high winds, Fisker said at the time.

With all of this happening in public ‚Äî and in a presidential election year ‚Äî Fisker‚Äôs struggles became highly politicized. The company was mentioned numerous times in presidential debates and speeches leading up to the election. Republican nominee Romney called Fisker and other DOE-supported companies losers.

The company didn‚Äôt seem to invest substantially in technology innovation or tech IP, and seemed to spend a disproportionate amount on suppliers. For example, numerous sources have said that the company paid upfront for 15,000 of some of the parts for its planned 15,000 Karmas. It ended up only selling around 2,000 of the cars. It has also been said that Fisker paid some funds upfront to have BMW make engines for the 100,000 Nina cars it hoped to produce ‚Äî in the end, Fisker didn‚Äôt deliver a single Nina.

Costs to build each Karma also creeped up because the company missed its volume targets, and because engineering had to change designs around supplier constraints. The company ended up adding $20,000 to its initial sale price.

Expensive hires may also have sucked away chunks of Fisker‚Äôs funding: Sources say that Fisker filled the upper levels of the company with seasoned auto executives from Detroit. At the high point of Fisker, the company had around 300 employees, plus dozens of contract staff. Bringing in a certain amount of the old guard could help a car startup ramp up quickly, and also impress potential investors with ‚Äúindustry names.‚Äù But those people are also used to big auto-industry budgets that included extensive travel and salaries ‚Äî that‚Äôs the opposite life of a tech startup.

## Fisker Inc.

In July 2016, Henrik Fisker expressed interest in designing a fully connected electric car with autonomous driving features and an aesthetically pleasing look. He has pursued battery technology, and hinted at potentially reviving the Fisker name with a pure-electric vehicle using technology that nobody else has. Since then Fisker has talked about delays to the promised solid state battery technology, which he does not expect to be able to be produced in volume until at least 2025. Posing risk for competition from more scientifically experienced future solid state battery producers such as Quantumscape.

***Forbes:*** ‚ÄúNow he‚Äôs back‚Äìand three things are different. First and foremost, he has a vital new partner: his wife, cofounder and Fisker Inc. CFO Geeta Gupta-Fisker. Second, his Los Angeles-based company is public this time around, raising more than $1 billion in an October 2020 IPO. And finally, Fisker‚Äôs stock price, up 56% since its debut, has made both Henrik and Geeta billionaires, each worth about $1.1 billion as of Friday‚Äôs market close. The auto industry has seen father-son and sibling leadership teams, but Fisker Inc.‚Äôs CEO-CFO combo is the fast-changing sector‚Äôs first husband and wife power couple.‚Äù

Wealth isn‚Äôt the purpose of the new company, Henrik says. ‚ÄúI never got into cars because of money. (This shows he is willing to do what is in the best interest of the company because he is not motivated by money, unlike 99% of other CEO‚Äôs)

The couple sought a big stake in the new venture to ensure they can control its fate in a way Fisker couldn‚Äôt with his earlier company.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yzhded6pfw171.png?width=408&format=png&auto=webp&s=54b30259720cf853a8efeacf058f2f74315260b9

Henrik is an auto industry celebrity, but Geeta‚Äôs background is equally impressive. A native of India, she holds multiple degrees in science, including a Ph.D. in biotechnology from Cambridge University where she was also a Research Newton Fellow. From there, she started a career in international investment for Lloyds Banking Group, and then managed investments for a high-net-worth client for several years. (In particular, this is insanely important - Geeta **KNOWS MONEY**! She knows how best to keep a company afloat, organize its share structure, provide value to shareholders, etc. because she has worked in the industry before. She may just be the most important element of Fisker Inc., due to the financial experience she has. At every step of the way, she is likely to make decisions with one sole focus - increasing share price and value).

She met her future husband in 2011 when he was visiting London, just before things started going very wrong at Fisker Automotive. They married in 2012.

‚ÄúWhen I left Fisker Automotive, all I had was my car,‚Äù Henrik remembers. ‚ÄúI'm in a different position, mainly because of Geeta. Because she cuts the deals.‚Äù

To get the new venture off the ground, the Fiskers invested the majority of their life savings‚Äìan enormous financial risk given the fate of Henrik‚Äôs prior company. Then, just as they were locking in plans for the IPO back in July, they were hit by a highly unwelcome complication: Geeta learned she had early-stage breast cancer.

‚ÄúShe got the call (from her doctor) during a call with investors,‚Äù Henrik says. Despite that bombshell, she continued working with banks and investors in the weeks that followed, even as she underwent two surgical procedures and radiation therapy. Her medical therapy concluded in November.

Henrik, who marvels at her fortitude throughout the health crisis says, ‚Äúshe only missed something like one day of work...That's just how she is. She works tirelessly.‚Äù

## Fisker Ocean

The Fisker Ocean will have a nearly 300-mile range with an 80 kWh battery and a solar panel roof as a range extender, adding approximately 1,000 free miles of range per year. Advanced electronics will be housed under the hood, and the vehicle will incorporate recycled and sustainable materials throughout. Deliveries of the Ocean are scheduled to begin in 2022.

Fisker has also announced a partnership with Electrify America to ensure Fisker Ocean vehicles will integrate seamlessly with Electrify America charging stations when the e-SUV hits the market. With features such as a solar roof and recycled inner materials, it will be, according to Fisker Inc., the ""world's most sustainable vehicle.""

In 2017, Fisker Inc. announced that it had filed patents on flexible solid-state battery designs. Fisker expected the batteries to be produced on a mass scale around 2020. A prototype of the battery debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018. In October 2018, Fisker announced new funding for battery development through Caterpillar Venture Capital. The solid-state batteries are intended to deliver longer vehicle range and faster charging times.

In 2018, Fisker was named to the board of directors of First Cobalt, a North American cobalt refinery that produces battery materials.

In September 2019, it was announced that Fisker Inc. was partnering with Game of Thrones actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who will serve as a partner and sustainability adviser to Fisker, to work on advanced, affordable, electric mobility models.

&#x200B;

[In addition to being a well-known actor, Coster-Waldau is also the United Nations Development Program Goodwill Ambassador for climate change and other social issues.](https://preview.redd.it/3hssff5vfw171.png?width=451&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebe55e2468c5b63d1bc0ac3c71547219dff5afaa)

Nikolaj wrote this piece about Fisker:

To quote a friend of mine who is a lot smarter than me, architect Bjarke Ingels: ‚ÄúThe idea that sustainability needs to sacrifice quality of life is a flawed one. It‚Äôs a design challenge, a challenge to build something that transforms the idea of sustainability into something that will increase the quality of life for all those around it.‚Äù

One person meeting that challenge is Henrik Fisker, who has designed some of the most iconic cars over the past decades for BMW and others, like the BMW Z8, Aston Martin DB9 and Aston Martin V8 Vantage. He‚Äôs a hero for gas-guzzling supercars. He is a fellow Dane, I am a fan, and we met, of all places, on Twitter.

When we met in person, he described his new project ‚Äî an all-electric luxury SUV ‚Äî and asked me if I would help spread the word on his car. The problem as I see it with most electric cars is that they only accomplish the basics. They get you from point A to B. They run electric so you don‚Äôt pollute while driving, but that‚Äôs it. They are basically unattractive combustion engine cars that have a battery thrown into them ‚Äî and for most of them, a battery with a limited range. What Fisker does is to try to make every part of the car in a sustainable and attractive way, like a full-length solar roof, recycled floor mats and vegan leather seats. It looks incredibly cool and inviting, with a great 250- to 300-mile range, and at a cost of just under $40,000, it‚Äôs a luxury car affordable to a mass market.

I said yes and even became an investor, not only because it‚Äôs a great car but more importantly, I hope and believe it can inspire other companies to actively incorporate sustainability goals into all aspects of their business. Fisker then had the idea of calling me ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù adviser. Which I am not. Just to be clear. Thanks Henrik, sounds cool, but I am an actor and a citizen, and that‚Äôs really it.

And what about Hollywood? Is our industry changing, are we at the forefront? Looking at social media, you would think so. And things are happening, but usually only when a camera is pointed at people. Remember a few years back when all awards shows only used EVs for the red carpet? We made a difference. We mattered. We showed the way. So cool. So green, so ‚Ä¶ brief. Now it‚Äôs back to the Escalade. But hey, we are not using plastic straws anymore!

To believe that change will come from Hollywood is not really based in reality (when did that stop us?), but we are great at reacting ‚Äî and things around us are changing, and changing us. I have a good friend who loves his SUV. It‚Äôs not electric. But he cannot give up his car. He is a good guy, he‚Äôs works for the U.N., so if he has a problem going electric, we all do. But if he is presented with an alternative that doesn‚Äôt mean a reduction in his quality of life, something like the Fisker SUV, I think he‚Äôd transition to electric in a heartbeat.

The IPO deal values Fisker Inc at US$2.9 billion, with an IPO share price of $10.

On July 30, 2020, Fisker announced plans for a four-vehicle portfolio by 2025. The Fisker Ocean SUV will be joined by a sports sedan based on their previously announced Fisker Emotion concept, a coupe-like SUV, and a lifestyle pickup truck. All will be electric vehicles.

On October 15, 2020, Fisker Inc announced it would be outsourcing vehicle production of its Fisker Ocean electric SUV to Magna Steyr, to reduce the complexities and costs related to the building and operating its own factory. Magna will start building the Fisker Ocean in Europe in 2022.

## Henrik Fisker Interview quotes:

I have people on Twitter saying, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just make the car next month? You have a prototype.‚Äù Most people don‚Äôt understand that it takes 18 months to do long-lead body tooling for high-volume vehicles. Most people don‚Äôt understand it takes two years to do durability tests and do all the engineering certification and everything else.

And on the business model itself, I believe that there is nobody in the near future or the next couple of years that‚Äôs going to make a million EVs on one model. Today, there‚Äôs nobody doing it. Tesla probably has the highest volume of one single model, a couple hundred thousand. But even the big giant established carmakers are not making, right now, a couple hundred thousand vehicles of one model. So the way you get volume, in my view, is if you partner up with other OEMs and share some of the expensive parts of the platform, which in my view is not anymore something that is unique IP or something that is a unique experience to the customer. An aluminum stamped floor or a steel stamped floor really doesn‚Äôt have any brand value anymore.

And obviously, as we move forward, we always start to do some of the things ourselves. But it was really about de-risking in our first vehicle to market. So we‚Äôre going to do another three vehicles, which we can do because we don‚Äôt have to spend all our money and effort on learning how to manufacture a car, for instance.

So we have programmed a lot. We have hired a head of ESG, environmental and social governance, and he is really spearheading developing specific... we kind of put out some goals that we would like to reach with suppliers, and we at least try to bring them in that direction. They are not reaching those goals right now, but they may reach them later. And then we have goals for ourselves. So for instance, we look at transport. Are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs closer to the plant, or are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs on the other side of the planet that way we have to then transport all that stuff. So those are the types of things that we‚Äôre really thinking about now as we‚Äôre nominating suppliers. And finally, materials as well, looking at sustainable materials. We‚Äôve actually picked up a lot of knowledge on that side as well, where we are adding more sustainable materials to our vehicle. So we are actually looking across everything ‚Äî supply chain, where the suppliers are located, what the suppliers are doing for sustainability, and also then of course in the vehicle itself ‚Äî in terms of the type of materials there.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nb8ozukrpw171.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd5a515f831dedcc57b25d717c5c133c0c74299d

So - let's summarize - prices are rising at their fastest pace in almost 30 years and incomes just plunged by their most ever! We're gonna need more stimmies!""  

Plus  to above; 

Last year, Hirschman Capital noted that since 1821, 98% of sovereigns that hit 130% debt/GDP have defaulted on their sovereign debt.   

The US hit 130% late last year. 

Simple Conclussion : The Fed can‚Äôt go ‚Äúhawkish‚Äù and raise rates without sending markets ‚Äìand economies‚Äìto their knees; by extension, they now have nothing left to ‚Äúcut‚Äù when the current everything bubble implodes.

And that  is a *real problem*.

 There are only two ways for sovereigns to default: 

Inflation or collapse.    

The latter is not an option. 

 As for a solution, what‚Äôs so tragic is that the only option before the Fed is an even bigger problem‚Äîcurrent and inevitably more inflation. 

 That is, if the Fed wants to keep markets (and their job security) breathing, they no longer have the foregoing template of ‚Äúrate-hike-followed-by-rate-cutting‚Äù at their disposal, which means they now have no choice but to dovishly keep rates near the zero-bound indefinitely.

But the only way to keep rates ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù and nailed to the floor of time is to purchase otherwise unwanted bonds to keep their prices elevated and hence yields and rates repressed.

Such bond ‚Äúaccommodation,‚Äù of course, costs money, and as we already know, the only ‚Äúmoney‚Äù the Fed has to spend is the kind they create out of thin air‚Äì the very kind of money (and policy) which leads to the kind of inflation discussed above‚Äînamely, the brutal kind.

 As for that fake money, the evidence of the Fed‚Äôs desperate (and only) direction is now obvious, as the following M2 money supply makes equally clear. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v774ta55sw171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e73c839beb67a67eea9aed7de4ac61d86813840

 

Fed is so embarrassed by this ‚Äúprinting solution‚Äù that they‚Äôve stopped *weekly* reporting of M2 data, and frankly, since March, have even stopped *monthly* reporting of the same.

That, of course, is both telling as well as disgraceful‚Ä¶ The Fed literally has something to hide, and that never bodes well, does it?

&#x200B;

 The correlation to central bank balance sheet (i.e., money supply) expansion and rising markets is now beyond dispute. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sgizb6xcsw171.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=aad2fe681fe0c49ac20368aba77e86c118b22959

 In short‚Äîdo you see the correlation and pattern? Do you see how the Fed‚Äôs market sausage is made? More importantly, do you now see the Fed‚Äôs self-made conundrum? 

 

Given that the Fed bows to the markets not the people, which choice do you think they‚Äôll make?

In other words, expect more money printing and more yield curve control‚Äîand hence more money creation, more inflation, and by extension more fiat currency debasement.

 More money supply to keep rates monetized simply means more currency debasement and rising inflation.",nn51ou,"""Fed's ""Favorite"" #Inflation Indicator (PCE) Explodes At Fastest Rate Since 1992 As Incomes Crash By Record"""

‚ÄúIn Keynes' description of a liquidity trap, people simply do not want to hold bonds and prefer other, non-liquid forms of money instead. Because of this preference, after converting bonds into cash, this causes an incidental but significant decrease to the bonds' prices and a subsequent increase to their yields. However, people prefer cash no matter how high these yields are or how high the central bank sets the bond's rates (yields).‚Äù

Basically, if we are in a liquidity trap, the central bank loses it‚Äôs control of the interest rates and people will never hold debt instruments regardless of how high the yield is. The central bank has not lost control of the interest rates yet, (since the debt is still serviceable for now) nor have they raised rates to test whether people are still willing to hold debt rather than cash.",,

I still think they are going to have a huge share buyback of over 14m shares (their buyback program was increased from 75m to 475m) in stock and add to the insider owned shares which is now at 54.80% over the week it has gone up about 2%. Which is a bullish signal. If 14m shares were bought that would leave about 51m shares to be traded publicly and the insider owned share percentage would go to about 62% which would be a large driving factor in the price going up due to scarcity.

[When we last left our hero,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrly28/the_legend_of_utheemperorofjenks_aka_ornamental/) he had just lost all of his rent money and what he could advance from credit cards on a failed Super Bowl bet, and a YOLO on ‚ÄúRhodium‚Äù that he ordered from a sketchy Slovakian Wish.com ripoff. Alas, it was, of course, fake, and he was broke and depressed. It might have been the first fatal case of autism. He thought to himself ‚ÄúAm I really that retarded?‚Äù Then, he realized ‚ÄúNo, it must be Oklahoma that‚Äôs retarded!‚Äù

So, [after a brief case of violent diarrhea from Oklahoma Grocery Store sushi](https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/lrslbb/psa_do_not_eat_grocery_store_sushi_right_now/), he was ready to hatch his plan! Uruguay! Yes, Uruguay. [He was going to move to Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lh5igx/c%C3%B3mo_se_puede_llegar_a_melo_desde_montevideo_sin/)

His plans for this move could‚Äôve been anyone‚Äôs guess. One possibility he inquired about was [how to be a Tea Blendmaster.](https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/lfga0m/how_does_one_become_a_blendmaster/) [Another was him possibly reconnecting with God.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/lsij6j/agnostic_jew_seeking_faith_in_god/) Yet, he seemed to be asking questions about another topic more often than the others...

[Bees.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lxcnt1/c%C3%B3mo_es_la_legalidad_de_la_apicultura_informal/)

Specifically, beekeeping, a topic he admitted he had no experience in, [as evident from him looking for any book on the subject as an introduction months before.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/)

What he planned on doing with the bees was anyone‚Äôs guess, and I doubt he thought it through that much either. One post **AFTER** he took possession of 200,000 bees (we‚Äôll get to that later,) was [asking Americans if there was a demand for mead in the states.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/) So, was he thinking of importing Uruguayan honey to the US to be made into mead? Was he going to make it himself? Did he move to another continent for no reason? Let‚Äôs all find out!

A little more than 2 months ago, he finally did it. [He moved to Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/m9ejpn/la_paloma/) And about a week after that, [he was driving a truck filled with 200k bees across his new country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/) Based on replies in that thread, he was aiming to have [a monopoly on beekeeping in the country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/gt48gke/)

[He picked up his hives without complication.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mtkkf3/about_to_upsize_my_apiary_whats_the_best_layout/) [And then he settled into Melo, Uruguay, and set up his apiary ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/n1jnte/my_humble_apiary_near_melo_uruguay/). Life was good.

But, trouble was afoot. According to a reply, [the species he was planning on keeping had literally never been kept by keepers in Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mtkkf3/about_to_upsize_my_apiary_whats_the_best_layout/gv0viej/) And then, disaster struck. [He went to TIFU to post his tale of spreading an invasive species in an industry he knew nothing about.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/nmd69k/tifu_by_importing_bees_to_uruguay/)

Indeed, he had no idea even what a bee was until he stumbled his way through a book, and then decided to YOLO into honey in Uruguay. He somehow got in touch with an ecology professor in Montevideo that would help him set things up in exchange for grad students fucking with them every now and again. Oh, and the bees were from fucking Myanmar. Handshake agreement, of course. Total Chad move.

And like I said before, the rest went without incident for a while. It would take the bees ‚Äúa year‚Äù to make honey, so he just kinda hung out, stayed busy, and tried to find part time work in a foreign country he arrived in 2.5 months earlier.

And then, the professor ghosted him. Just disappeared. Shortly thereafter, government agents come out about this kid from Oklahoma illegally importing a non-native bee to their country. Apparently his bees had been fucking with other apiaries. So, he did probably the smartest thing he‚Äôs ever done.

He ran.

He fucking ran from the Uruguayan government, took a plane to LAX, and arrived with $14 to his name. His friend sent him $100, which wasn‚Äôt enough to go back to Oklahoma, so he took a $75 flight to Seattle, where he is also not from.

His last post is from a train out of the airport, with $39 to his name. I don‚Äôt know what is in store for him, but I know that $39 is as good as spent on urchin futures or whatever market he‚Äôs going to crash up there.

1921,,2021-05-28 03:12:37,t3_nmofz4,,wallstreetbets,"This started as a comment reply but I thought maybe people would like reading it. I've been researching Palantir since literally late November 2020 and I have nearly my entire portfolio in LEAPS expiring January 2023. So I have continually done more research on them this is just the basics to clear up confusion and help people who don't understand it because it's hard to hear all the hype and stuff. Also AMC to the moon tomorrow for my FDs I bought!! Don't judge me it's just fun to be in on the action on weeks like this.


So you should think of palantir as basically three companies and they actually are very far from unprofitable. 

They developed the really massive government software (gotham) specifically as a result of an interaction that happened to Peter Thiel while he was at paypal. They were losing millions to foreign scammers at paypal and the solution ended up being a high quality algorithm that flagged the most likely scam transactions and then allowed analysts to efficiently double check and verify the real scam transactions.

 It essentially was using what computers are efficient at (sorting through massive amounts of data) and then combining that with what humans are good at (looking at the more complex nuances that at least at that point computer algorithms were incapable of doing) and augmenting the humans ability to make complex decisions by rapidly sorting through the incoming data and bringing everything good to their attention.

They fixed paypals using this method and literally made the company profitable overnight because of fixing how much they were losing in the scam transactions. The FBI contacted PayPal and Thiel about using that initial software. That was literally his inspiration for what would become Palantir. He goes over it in huge detail in his book zero to one. If you make an audible account you can read it for free and find the chapter I'm talking about.

Then for 15 years they perfected the government software into the absolute nearly monopoly it is now in government intelligence augmentation software. The whole time though they reinvested almost everything for the last 10 years into building the commercial software (Foundry). That side of the business has only been live for a VERY short time and initially they literally didn't spend a single dollar on marketing their first commercial clients sought THEM out because of their insane reputation with the government. Foundry helps with supply chains and all kinds of other important data  insights. But if you want a recent example the NIH and the NHS both used Foundry to figure out how to best distribute the vaccine and vaccine distribution in the US and Britain has far outpaced expectations. You think commercial companies aren't going to be interested in using the software that was literally proven on a level like that?

 They're only just now adding huge amounts of people to their sales teams literally in the last six months which if you read Peter thiels book is insane for the stock because they have this crazy long term plan and he literally talks about how when they get to a certain point and start adding sales as a full sector of the company it means that is the company the company plans to BEGIN scaling. Meaning they're this big and they literally only just started on the scaling part. Which they've also said in tons of interviews if you're a die hard Palantirian like me. 



They actually also have the third side of the  business which is their actual like full AI for weaponization and war and defense for the government. Gotham is like helping analysts and commanders lead and even helping police or agents figure out what's going on. This other software is different. It's called Apollo and its only at the beginning too. It's like pure AI machine learning AI handles everything stuff. Go find a video called pentagon head of NSC briefs public on AI I think it's on the PBS channel on YouTube or some shit. Or you can listen to Joe Biden talk about how we're going to double our percentage of gdp spending on AI. The amount of government money that's going to go into AI as a weapon to compete with China DWARFS peoples expectations of how much large the market for the kind of software palantir makes is. 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201001005334/en/U.S.-Army-Research-Lab-Selects-Palantir-Technologies-Inc.-for-91M-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-Development

This is literally the backbone of everything AI that the government is about to invest in. Sure they're going to experiment with other research but if you do research you'll also find Palantir is the ONLY company that does anything remotely like this software that has anywhere near the kind of clearances like what is required for these contracts. They are currently a clearance level 5 and about to be the highest 6. The closest competitors are almost all a 3 or lower I'm not even sure if there's more than a single 4 and that stuff is crazy hard to get. 

But like again I'm an obsessive. I realize why people get so excited about the commercial side scaling and how it's very possible and can make them huge and it will. But I'm actually pretty sure the reason people like Cathy Wood has such a huge boner for them is that she realizes how MASSIVELY. And I mean MASSIVELY underestimated the amount of government revenue they will get from all this AI investing the United States and NATO are about to do. It's literally the next Manhattan project and they're absolutely going to be one of the biggest players developing it if not the biggest. I think it's funny because most people are pretty disinterested in the government stuff for Palantir but i really think the weaponized AI apollo stuff may be as big as anything could ever be. 




Also people got the insider selling stuff very very wrong. Tom Nash (love him or hate him I don't care) has a few really good recent videos where he explains it in basically full detail what was happening. The selling panicked a lot of retail investors during a time when the buying for growth markets had really slowed because of rate hike due to inflation scares and a ton of retail holders got scared and caused more selling and more people got scared because of that and sold and it really just was mass psychology in effect and a LOT of FUD and confusion. 

Basically a few executives karp in particular got billions of dollars worth of options that vest but literally expire so you have to exercise them which means you buy shares of the company at a strike price. Well because it's the company granting shares the strike price is literally 10 cents or something and these automatically have to vest at quarterly increments. So everytime karp was exercising he's actually buying shares. Like over 150 million in total maybe a lot more million SHARES not dollars. shares. And even those when he exercising he's buying shares technically from the company it ALL counts as profit on taxes and ITS NOT LONG TERM CAP GAINS ELIGIBLE. So over the last year plus this year he's essentially getting shares but the literal dollar value of those shares to the government counts as pure profit. So his total income which he's getting taxed at 40% of is in the BILLIONS yes billions. Because that's a lot to handle people that work for them actually automatically schedule sells of shares to cover the taxes so that there's no issue it's not even like him saying sell today and they do this.... TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INSIDER SELLING TO THE SEC. That's why it's automatically happening so no one can ever claim he's timing it. 

So listen cause here's where it gets important. The exercising of the shares counts as almost pure profits but remember he's receiving SHARES not dollars he doesn't actually get billions of dollars. So has to then sell SOME of the shares so he can pays taxes on that. Then when he sells the shares to pay the taxes for exercising he actually owes even more money if they went up from when he exercised. So everytime he's selling low its actually good for him because it's less ADDITIONAL PROFIT that he would owe taxes on.

 If he wasn't selling its because he thought it would go down even further and then he would actually owe less taxes overall. So if he thought it was going to tank he'd wait and actually get a nice fat discount on his taxes. 

I know this seems really crazy but I promise that's how it works you can look it up in detail but yeah shocking that mainstream media and redditors/youtubers who barely do research and have no real understanding of how these billion dollar compensations work would get it wrong. Unbelievable I know. If he had actually sold the massive overall percentage of his shares that some people claim he did the company would be at like $3-6 dollars not low 20s. Retail got confused because of market pressured due to interest rate fears from inflation and sold low (like retail always does) to institutions.",nmofz4,"Palantir DD if you want to understand company and it's history better (also insider ""selling"" explained in detail)"

What is Blue Apron?


Blue Apron (NYSE: APRN) was the forgotten step child, bad luck Brian, IPO of summer 2017 that priced below range and had the misfortune of debuting after Amazon bought Whole Foods. Since it‚Äôs debut, the stock has suffered dropping from nearly $150 per share (adjusted for a 2019 reverse-split necessitated to stay listed) to as low as approximately $2.00!


Why the Drop?


Management. Fucking. Sucked. The prior executive team essentially handed Chad Hello Fresh the keys to the kingdom, when they made the fatal error of betting that the ‚Äúhigh affinity core users‚Äù would be enough to sustain the business. For this reason, they cut marketing to nearly nothing and attempted to realize operating leverage by shrinking the customer base only to its most prolific buyers.

This was stupid. HelloFresh did the opposite, essentially giving away meals, and they used it to stockpile market share. Put a chart up of HelloFresh customers against Blue Apron. You‚Äôll see the two lines converge and a clear indication that HelloFresh stole most of their business. HelloFresh was one of the best trades of the past 5 years. Look at the chart, look at the sales, and look at the margins. They have managed to achieve operating leverage by employing affordable pricing and emphasizing retention.


Blue Apron Might Go Under....


Today the company is in a dire place. Languishing away in Micro Cap hell at an $80M market cap, no one on Wall Street wants to cover these guys. Only their bankers, CG and MS, write them research and neither are overly optimistic. They‚Äôre in a shit spot with a credit line that mandates they keep $15M cash at all times, and they keep their customer base above 300K (thus far, they‚Äôve struggled). They‚Äôre sitting on $29M and burn enough cash per Q that they might go below that $15M level (wouldn‚Äôt be a first). All signs are negative...


But I Think They Might Win


Blue Apron is under new management. Linda Kozlowski, is the former COO of ETSY and an ex-strategist at Alibaba. She believes HelloFresh did things right and she wants to right the ship. Her ballsy-ass plan is to ride the line on cash and go all in on customer growth. She realizes those customers are worth a lot more than income on the P&L, and that she needs to make the pot as big as she can. Thus far, it‚Äôs worked. Customers are up over 20% in the past two periods and retention rates are rising. We are seeing signs of operating leverage, and it opens a big possibility.


My Prediction

Management is buying shares. They know the company is not healthy. The only logic is that they have a plan that‚Äôs working. You can‚Äôt sell a dying business with a shrinking share, but you can certainly sell a growing community, that could be an accretive asset to a better capitalized entity. I think Linda is going either get the business in a position where it can refinance for better terms, or where it can be sold to create shareholder value via a strategic alternative.

If that happen, given this is priced for bankruptcy and ignored by the Street, the returns could easily reach the triple digits. I‚Äôm long and I plan to add on additional weakness.

Everyone is talking about how the squeeze didn't even happen and the shorts didn't cover yet. What I don't understand is why wouldn't that be possible? If short interest is 17%, so let's round up to about 100M shares. Today the volume traded was 700M shares. Couldn't 100M of those 700M have been the shorts covering? And if they didn't cover, today alone 700M shares were traded, why would 100M shares bought by shorts cause a squeeze if today 700M were traded?

I have been having this question for awhile, since I noticed the same with GME. In the days preceding January 28th (when GME reached its peak), the combined volume was several times the amount of float. How come the squeeze happened and why did it happen? If the volume was so high, couldn't the shorts have covered in the days preceding that?

I hope this makes sense and I really hope someone will be kind enough to explain a fellow retard who only knows about crayons what this all means.

Everything looked to have gone off successfully. We are now waiting on the data and craft to be analysed and inspected. This will take a few weeks according to Michael Colglazier.
That being said he had already outlined the test schedule in the earnings zoom call.

1st test flight - may 
2nd crewed flight - June 
3rd flight with R Branson on board late June/July 

4th flight this will be taking the Italian airforce on a training mission (600k a seat) late July


On the run in to the first test flight some possible maintenance issues appeared with the carrier plane White knight 2‚Ä¶. 
This indeed could have gone either way , after 2 weeks inspections it was decided that WK2 did not need to delay testing no maintenance was needed at this point. Scheduled Maintenance will commence in the fall after all tests have been completed.
Upon this news it is my opinion that the testing programme will go ahead as planned.

The market has responded accordingly and the stock is now up from $17-‚Ç¨31

I had a look at $BB and assume that we finally formed the bottom. In the last few days we saw a sharp rise which might continue in the next weeks. If we can break the 12$ resistance, the next targets would be aroung 25-28$. 

Using Elliot wave theory we are probably at the end of the correction wave 4 and now began with the bullish wave 5.

Price targets:

\#1 12$

\#2 25$

1944,,2021-05-28 09:17:32,t3_nmtt43,,wallstreetbets,"Trainline has taken a huge dip since the UK government's announcement of the plan to nationalise the railway network. The plan includes creating an online ticketing platform by Great British Railways which might have a huge blow on Trainline revenue. However, this platform does not yet exist and will probably take a couple of years to develop. Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed.

In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales.  Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%.

I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time  for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

1949,,2021-05-28 10:41:01,t3_nmuzzi,,wallstreetbets,"Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent of Modernas if not more. Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects) 

Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

Imagine if the spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize one piece to understand the whole picture it and helps modify your DNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates it can still recognize the virus. In contrast to using one portion of the picture as it mutates it's easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine, that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. Not only that but they have had the least amount of side effects of any covid vaccine deeming it the safest covid vaccine.... 

And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein (whole picture) and the safety profile. Also worth a mention is that you could store it in a regular refrigerator, and let it sit out in room temperature while you're vaccinating people instead of a special ultra low temp freeze needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers, this is a majority of the world. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines so other protein competitors will be far behind and they will have an a moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing they teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine. They will be combining flu and covid vaccine by 2025 for possibly double the price of current covid vaccine.

 They are pretty much de-risked at this point. Yes you could buy other  biotechs that can go up 20x but are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up) that has all successful trials done so far, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment to where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place there are no more glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""

They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. Yesterday at market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. 
 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

Future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract in there ( in the link below in another message). It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 

I own a lot of $250 July calls along with about 1k shares. I'm all in baby. LFG I expect to turn 200k into over a million in a year's time via shares and options

Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. This is huge as the combo is going to differentiate them especially since both flu and covid vaccines are first in class.

""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior.""
2) Being that we do not have access to a 10-K filing for Q4 fiscal '19, we will access other filings that do in fact reference numbers from fiscal '19...

3) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $223.3M under Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19)
But, that is TOTAL Revenue; we need to find out what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike sales...
4) To calculate what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike Sales, we can use numbers from neighboring Q3 (i.e. Three Months Ended March 31, 2019)...
A) On page 6 of the 10-Q, you will find Revenue of ""Connected Fitness Products"" (aka Bike Sales) to be $261.6M
B) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $316.7M
C) % of Bike Sales per TOTAL Revenue: $261.6M / $316.7M * 100 = 82.6% {""Connected Fitness Products"" Revenue (aka Bike Sales)}
5) Apply 82.6% to the TOTAL Revenue $223.3M for Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19): $223.3M x 0.826 = $184.45M {Bike Sales for Q4 of fiscal '19}

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote... By mid-July, we‚Äôll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase precious metals  especially silver amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative 

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

Gold rose over 60% in the 1930s as the prices of stocks and real estate crashed. You could buy an entire block with a one ounce gold coin. Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms.

I must address Cramer's statement because he is obviously trying to add fuel to the short-selling fire: When he says ""we're not going natural gas"" he is clearly making a vague and general statement meant to be interpreted in the worst possible way: ""no one is going to buy or use natural gas."" By now, I hope everyone that is interested in this stock understands that CLNE offers an alternative transportation fuel, thus, the investments made by BP and Chevron, and not revolutionary technology like some EV's (but this is mostly hype meant to catapult EVs to the front. What most people do not realize is that driverless technology and such can be placed in Petro vehicles too). Also, unfortunately, the company has done a terrible marketting job. That's why powerful analysts can get away with making vague and unsupported statements. The fact that Cramer explained the stock's decrease over the last month as being due to widespread dissaproval is misleading, at best. Many people do not yet know about the cleanliness and therapeutic effects RNG has on the climate.

The News...

If you haven't read yet it looks like Federal Cannabis legalization my be around the corner. [Here](https://www.mpp.org/policy/federal/the-more-act/) is the House Bill. Supporters seem on board and like the reforms they have done to the bill including rescheduling cannabis. [Last time](https://mjbizdaily.com/key-us-house-lawmaker-reintroduces-federal-marijuana-legalization-bill/) the bill was introduced it cleared the House.   


Personally I think this gets a lot of support especially from a fiscal point of view. With stimulus stalling and a giant debate going on about how to pay for the stimulus I think cannabis offers the easiest way to collect federal revenue. A simple review of the bill and the fiscal benefits to the Fed's can be read [here](https://www.justtherealnews.com/congress/nadler-blumenauer-lee-jackson-lee-jeffries-velazquez-reintroduce-comprehensive-marijuana-reform-legislation/). The bill states a 5% fed tax. Money coming for uncle Sam, right when questions about paying for stimulus.... Personally I think it adds up, but that's for you to decide. 

Okay so that's the hype...

Let's talk about the tickers listed ($SNDL and $TLRY). 

$SNDL

I'll start with the cheaper YOLO, $SNDL. $SNDL short interest isn't high, but the company did issue convertible notes a while back around .7c if my memory is correct. I'm not saying they won't do it again, but they should be in a good place fiscally for now. Float is high with about 1.6B shares out there. However today's volume at the time of writing is over 415M. That's not bad given such a high float. It's about 200% more than the average volume. 

The options chain on $SNDL has me giddy. With over 200,000 options currently in the money on todays move above $1 there is some high potential here for some interesting action. The put to call ratio is just obnoxiously low at .08 it's screaming upwards betting. If we hold above $1 the potential squeeze up could be amazing.   


It's also broken up on the trend lines and out of the downward channel it was in. The regression channel from the peak squeeze back in Feb just broke out today according to my crayons I have laying around. 

$TLRY

$TLRY was the squeeze of a lifetime if you remember it back in 19'. The ticker was just a money printer with it's low float and stupid hype. Then they proceeded to do, like they all do, and issue debt. Shares tumbled since then falling from $120 --> $5. Ouch bag holders.   


Like all the cannabis stocks the Feb bump pushed $TLRY to above $60 in an amazing move. $TLRY has a lower short interest than $SNDL, but it also has a much lower float at about 300M. Compared to $SNDL the volume here isn't as good, but still remains decently above the avg volume around 36M as of right now. 

If we peep the options chain we also see a crazy low P/C ratio around .11. But we don't have the Open Interest in the chain like $SNDL does unless you roll out to Jun 18. Then we finally get some decent OI.   


Personally I am going with $SNDL. The option's chain looks better, the stock is cheaper, and the short interest is a little better. My advice would be to roll out till at least the Jun 11th $1 strike to not get eaten alive by Theta and IV crush. But WSB does what WSB wants and that's why I love you all.   
Do not go above the $2 strikes IMO. You will get crushed by theta unless we get an insane move, which could happen but I don't see the risk / reward there.",nn326f,MORE ACT / CANNABIS / $SNDL & $TLRY Potential

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday

>Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers‚Äô attempt to corner the market on the metal.

-
>Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926‚Äì2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers‚Äô Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.

-
>By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged‚ÄîMarch 27‚Äîsilver fell to $10.80, the metal‚Äôs biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, ‚ÄúA billion dollars isn‚Äôt what it used to be,‚Äù the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.

-
>To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978‚Äì91) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities.",nn36fw,There is no silver short squeeze happening.

* 16,000+ reservations already. More than Tesla had 18 months pre-production
* Revenue streams include leasing automotives, servicing, selling emissions credits, selling insurance (like selling the pickaxe to miners, and selling the diamonds to the mine owners too, absolutely genius - Fisker are insuring cars which they own, because the customer is only leasing it)
* High short interest (20%+), high analyst price targets compared to current share price (100%+) and low valuation compared to peers ($3bn market cap currently)
* Designing the first ever all-electric popemobile - Massive, soon to be historic, event!
* I give $FSR (currently $13 a share) a price target of $100 by end of year 2022, if not sooner
* Price Targets: $35 by end of year - Previous ATH. $50 start of next year - European and Chinese debut of prototypes. $100 end of 2022 - start of production (SOP). $150+ 2023
* 2025 Price Targets, calculated using projected data: Bear case - $97 a share, Bull case - $519 a share
* Downside in the short term is capped by the large amount of cash on hand - one third of market cap is cash. Long term, is capped by risk factors, which are almost eligible and affect every automotive startup anyway.

## Fisker Automotive

In 2008, Fisker Automotive raised over $90 million from investors including venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. In September 2009, Fisker Automotive was awarded a $528 million loan guarantee by the United States Department of Energy (DOE). The automaker was one of four recipients of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, to encourage the domestic manufacture of electric cars. The funds were to be used to develop the Karma, as well as an affordable family-size plug-in hybrid car. The loan facility was frozen at $192 million in February 2012, after the DOE claimed that Fisker missed its milestones

In December 2011, just as the Fisker Karma was launched, its battery supplier, A123 Systems, recalled all batteries, followed by a second recall in 2012. A123 filed for bankruptcy in October 2012, leaving Fisker Automotive without a battery supplier. After selling approximately 2,000 units, production of the Fisker Karma was suspended in November 2012, in the absence of its battery supplier.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/59vfj5wa8w171.png?width=511&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1c03d1e1254fea00c195776122de2b26099dd35

Henrik Fisker resigned as chairman from Fisker Automotive in March 2013, because of disagreements with management about business strategy. Later that year, the company declared voluntary bankruptcy.Fisker raised and spent more than a billion dollars over its lifetime.The heart of Fisker‚Äôs business model was in that early deal with Quantum. The idea was to design a gorgeous car, and have suppliers like Quantum provide the technology because off-the-shelf parts from suppliers would help keep costs down.

But there were problems with this strategy: Sometimes, those parts had to be custom-made to fit the design vision, which resulted in higher prices for Fisker. Other times, parts were delivered late or, worse, faulty, but Fisker was locked in to those supplier relationships. Sources close to Fisker have also said that many of the parts were owned by the suppliers themselves, so Fisker didn‚Äôt own a lot of the internal technology.

The broker that raised funds for Fisker automotive, by selling their private shares, was Advanced Equities.It wasn‚Äôt until December 2011 and into 2012 that the more dubious efforts of Advanced Equities became clearer to Fisker‚Äôs hundreds of investors. The last few hundred million dollars of Advanced Equities‚Äô fund raising for Fisker, starting with the D-1 round, was what brokers call ‚Äúpay to play.‚Äù As Fisker was running into technical, delivery and political problems, its valuation was quickly declining. But the company still needed more money, so the brokers went back to its current investors and said: Unless you give this more, your current shares will be diluted and your preferred stock will be converted to common stock.

It was essentially a gun to their heads. This is why investor Wray sued Fisker in February 2012, alleging he was on the receiving end of this tactic. In his lawsuit, he says Advanced Equities sent him a letter dated Jan. 18, 2012, stating that he needed to decide if he wanted to invest in Fisker‚Äôs next round, and pay around $84,000 by Jan. 27, 2012 ‚Äî a little over a week from receiving the letter. He also says that Advanced Equities assured him that he would have anti-dilution protection. According to the audio clip from Advanced Equities‚Äô internal sales call in early 2010, Advanced Equity leaders say that the Fisker deal will ‚Äúsuffer no dilution,‚Äù and was ‚Äúa dream scenario.‚Äù

That dream would soon end. In September 2012 after Fisker closed on $1.2 billion in funding, the bulk of it organized by Advanced Equities, the SEC charged the broker with misleading investors when it raised money for another company back in 2009 and 2010 (Bloom Energy). Advanced settled, agreeing to pay $1 million, and its co-founders were personally fined. Two months later Advanced Equities closed up shop.

Later, A123 Systems itself went bankrupt, causing more problems for Fisker. Fisker claimed that A123 Systems owed it $140 million, but a bankruptcy settlement reduced that to a paltry $15 million.

Then there was the just plain terrible luck for the ironically named Karma: Super Storm Sandy wiped out 338 of its Karmas in storage in New Jersey. The cars first drowned, and then caught on fire ‚Äî salt water damage caused a short circuit that was spread to other cars by high winds, Fisker said at the time.

With all of this happening in public ‚Äî and in a presidential election year ‚Äî Fisker‚Äôs struggles became highly politicized. The company was mentioned numerous times in presidential debates and speeches leading up to the election. Republican nominee Romney called Fisker and other DOE-supported companies losers.

The company didn‚Äôt seem to invest substantially in technology innovation or tech IP, and seemed to spend a disproportionate amount on suppliers. For example, numerous sources have said that the company paid upfront for 15,000 of some of the parts for its planned 15,000 Karmas. It ended up only selling around 2,000 of the cars. It has also been said that Fisker paid some funds upfront to have BMW make engines for the 100,000 Nina cars it hoped to produce ‚Äî in the end, Fisker didn‚Äôt deliver a single Nina.

Costs to build each Karma also creeped up because the company missed its volume targets, and because engineering had to change designs around supplier constraints. The company ended up adding $20,000 to its initial sale price.

Expensive hires may also have sucked away chunks of Fisker‚Äôs funding: Sources say that Fisker filled the upper levels of the company with seasoned auto executives from Detroit. At the high point of Fisker, the company had around 300 employees, plus dozens of contract staff. Bringing in a certain amount of the old guard could help a car startup ramp up quickly, and also impress potential investors with ‚Äúindustry names.‚Äù But those people are also used to big auto-industry budgets that included extensive travel and salaries ‚Äî that‚Äôs the opposite life of a tech startup.

## Fisker Inc.

In July 2016, Henrik Fisker expressed interest in designing a fully connected electric car with autonomous driving features and an aesthetically pleasing look. He has pursued battery technology, and hinted at potentially reviving the Fisker name with a pure-electric vehicle using technology that nobody else has. Since then Fisker has talked about delays to the promised solid state battery technology, which he does not expect to be able to be produced in volume until at least 2025. Posing risk for competition from more scientifically experienced future solid state battery producers such as Quantumscape.

***Forbes:*** ‚ÄúNow he‚Äôs back‚Äìand three things are different. First and foremost, he has a vital new partner: his wife, cofounder and Fisker Inc. CFO Geeta Gupta-Fisker. Second, his Los Angeles-based company is public this time around, raising more than $1 billion in an October 2020 IPO. And finally, Fisker‚Äôs stock price, up 56% since its debut, has made both Henrik and Geeta billionaires, each worth about $1.1 billion as of Friday‚Äôs market close. The auto industry has seen father-son and sibling leadership teams, but Fisker Inc.‚Äôs CEO-CFO combo is the fast-changing sector‚Äôs first husband and wife power couple.‚Äù

Wealth isn‚Äôt the purpose of the new company, Henrik says. ‚ÄúI never got into cars because of money. (This shows he is willing to do what is in the best interest of the company because he is not motivated by money, unlike 99% of other CEO‚Äôs)

The couple sought a big stake in the new venture to ensure they can control its fate in a way Fisker couldn‚Äôt with his earlier company.

Henrik is an auto industry celebrity, but Geeta‚Äôs background is equally impressive. A native of India, she holds multiple degrees in science, including a Ph.D. in biotechnology from Cambridge University where she was also a Research Newton Fellow. From there, she started a career in international investment for Lloyds Banking Group, and then managed investments for a high-net-worth client for several years. (In particular, this is insanely important - Geeta **KNOWS MONEY**! She knows how best to keep a company afloat, organize its share structure, provide value to shareholders, etc. because she has worked in the industry before. She may just be the most important element of Fisker Inc., due to the financial experience she has. At every step of the way, she is likely to make decisions with one sole focus - increasing share price and value).

She met her future husband in 2011 when he was visiting London, just before things started going very wrong at Fisker Automotive. They married in 2012.

‚ÄúWhen I left Fisker Automotive, all I had was my car,‚Äù Henrik remembers. ‚ÄúI'm in a different position, mainly because of Geeta. Because she cuts the deals.‚Äù

To get the new venture off the ground, the Fiskers invested the majority of their life savings‚Äìan enormous financial risk given the fate of Henrik‚Äôs prior company. Then, just as they were locking in plans for the IPO back in July, they were hit by a highly unwelcome complication: Geeta learned she had early-stage breast cancer.

‚ÄúShe got the call (from her doctor) during a call with investors,‚Äù Henrik says. Despite that bombshell, she continued working with banks and investors in the weeks that followed, even as she underwent two surgical procedures and radiation therapy. Her medical therapy concluded in November.

Henrik, who marvels at her fortitude throughout the health crisis says, ‚Äúshe only missed something like one day of work...That's just how she is. She works tirelessly.‚Äù

## Fisker Ocean

The Fisker Ocean will have a nearly 300-mile range with an 80 kWh battery and a solar panel roof as a range extender, adding approximately 1,000 free miles of range per year. Advanced electronics will be housed under the hood, and the vehicle will incorporate recycled and sustainable materials throughout. Deliveries of the Ocean are scheduled to begin in 2022.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s87j6bdsfw171.png?width=438&format=png&auto=webp&s=e40add9ce53319d31db242cce73a303afb03cbab

Fisker has also announced a partnership with Electrify America to ensure Fisker Ocean vehicles will integrate seamlessly with Electrify America charging stations when the e-SUV hits the market. With features such as a solar roof and recycled inner materials, it will be, according to Fisker Inc., the ""world's most sustainable vehicle.""

In 2017, Fisker Inc. announced that it had filed patents on flexible solid-state battery designs. Fisker expected the batteries to be produced on a mass scale around 2020. A prototype of the battery debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018. In October 2018, Fisker announced new funding for battery development through Caterpillar Venture Capital. The solid-state batteries are intended to deliver longer vehicle range and faster charging times.

In 2018, Fisker was named to the board of directors of First Cobalt, a North American cobalt refinery that produces battery materials.

In September 2019, it was announced that Fisker Inc. was partnering with Game of Thrones actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who will serve as a partner and sustainability adviser to Fisker, to work on advanced, affordable, electric mobility models.

&#x200B;

[In addition to being a well-known actor, Coster-Waldau is also the United Nations Development Program Goodwill Ambassador for climate change and other social issues.](https://preview.redd.it/3hssff5vfw171.png?width=451&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebe55e2468c5b63d1bc0ac3c71547219dff5afaa)

Nikolaj wrote this piece about Fisker:

To quote a friend of mine who is a lot smarter than me, architect Bjarke Ingels: ‚ÄúThe idea that sustainability needs to sacrifice quality of life is a flawed one. It‚Äôs a design challenge, a challenge to build something that transforms the idea of sustainability into something that will increase the quality of life for all those around it.‚Äù

One person meeting that challenge is Henrik Fisker, who has designed some of the most iconic cars over the past decades for BMW and others, like the BMW Z8, Aston Martin DB9 and Aston Martin V8 Vantage. He‚Äôs a hero for gas-guzzling supercars. He is a fellow Dane, I am a fan, and we met, of all places, on Twitter.

When we met in person, he described his new project ‚Äî an all-electric luxury SUV ‚Äî and asked me if I would help spread the word on his car. The problem as I see it with most electric cars is that they only accomplish the basics. They get you from point A to B. They run electric so you don‚Äôt pollute while driving, but that‚Äôs it. They are basically unattractive combustion engine cars that have a battery thrown into them ‚Äî and for most of them, a battery with a limited range. What Fisker does is to try to make every part of the car in a sustainable and attractive way, like a full-length solar roof, recycled floor mats and vegan leather seats. It looks incredibly cool and inviting, with a great 250- to 300-mile range, and at a cost of just under $40,000, it‚Äôs a luxury car affordable to a mass market.

I said yes and even became an investor, not only because it‚Äôs a great car but more importantly, I hope and believe it can inspire other companies to actively incorporate sustainability goals into all aspects of their business. Fisker then had the idea of calling me ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù adviser. Which I am not. Just to be clear. Thanks Henrik, sounds cool, but I am an actor and a citizen, and that‚Äôs really it.

And what about Hollywood? Is our industry changing, are we at the forefront? Looking at social media, you would think so. And things are happening, but usually only when a camera is pointed at people. Remember a few years back when all awards shows only used EVs for the red carpet? We made a difference. We mattered. We showed the way. So cool. So green, so ‚Ä¶ brief. Now it‚Äôs back to the Escalade. But hey, we are not using plastic straws anymore!

To believe that change will come from Hollywood is not really based in reality (when did that stop us?), but we are great at reacting ‚Äî and things around us are changing, and changing us. I have a good friend who loves his SUV. It‚Äôs not electric. But he cannot give up his car. He is a good guy, he‚Äôs works for the U.N., so if he has a problem going electric, we all do. But if he is presented with an alternative that doesn‚Äôt mean a reduction in his quality of life, something like the Fisker SUV, I think he‚Äôd transition to electric in a heartbeat.

The IPO deal values Fisker Inc at US$2.9 billion, with an IPO share price of $10.

On July 30, 2020, Fisker announced plans for a four-vehicle portfolio by 2025. The Fisker Ocean SUV will be joined by a sports sedan based on their previously announced Fisker Emotion concept, a coupe-like SUV, and a lifestyle pickup truck. All will be electric vehicles.

On October 15, 2020, Fisker Inc announced it would be outsourcing vehicle production of its Fisker Ocean electric SUV to Magna Steyr, to reduce the complexities and costs related to the building and operating its own factory. Magna will start building the Fisker Ocean in Europe in 2022.

## Henrik Fisker Interview quotes:

I have people on Twitter saying, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just make the car next month? You have a prototype.‚Äù Most people don‚Äôt understand that it takes 18 months to do long-lead body tooling for high-volume vehicles. Most people don‚Äôt understand it takes two years to do durability tests and do all the engineering certification and everything else.

And on the business model itself, I believe that there is nobody in the near future or the next couple of years that‚Äôs going to make a million EVs on one model. Today, there‚Äôs nobody doing it. Tesla probably has the highest volume of one single model, a couple hundred thousand. But even the big giant established carmakers are not making, right now, a couple hundred thousand vehicles of one model. So the way you get volume, in my view, is if you partner up with other OEMs and share some of the expensive parts of the platform, which in my view is not anymore something that is unique IP or something that is a unique experience to the customer. An aluminum stamped floor or a steel stamped floor really doesn‚Äôt have any brand value anymore.

And obviously, as we move forward, we always start to do some of the things ourselves. But it was really about de-risking in our first vehicle to market. So we‚Äôre going to do another three vehicles, which we can do because we don‚Äôt have to spend all our money and effort on learning how to manufacture a car, for instance.

So we have programmed a lot. We have hired a head of ESG, environmental and social governance, and he is really spearheading developing specific... we kind of put out some goals that we would like to reach with suppliers, and we at least try to bring them in that direction. They are not reaching those goals right now, but they may reach them later. And then we have goals for ourselves. So for instance, we look at transport. Are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs closer to the plant, or are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs on the other side of the planet that way we have to then transport all that stuff. So those are the types of things that we‚Äôre really thinking about now as we‚Äôre nominating suppliers. And finally, materials as well, looking at sustainable materials. We‚Äôve actually picked up a lot of knowledge on that side as well, where we are adding more sustainable materials to our vehicle. So we are actually looking across everything ‚Äî supply chain, where the suppliers are located, what the suppliers are doing for sustainability, and also then of course in the vehicle itself ‚Äî in terms of the type of materials there.

So - let's summarize - prices are rising at their fastest pace in almost 30 years and incomes just plunged by their most ever! We're gonna need more stimmies!""  

Plus  to above; 

Last year, Hirschman Capital noted that since 1821, 98% of sovereigns that hit 130% debt/GDP have defaulted on their sovereign debt.   

The US hit 130% late last year. 

Simple Conclussion : The Fed can‚Äôt go ‚Äúhawkish‚Äù and raise rates without sending markets ‚Äìand economies‚Äìto their knees; by extension, they now have nothing left to ‚Äúcut‚Äù when the current everything bubble implodes.

And that  is a *real problem*.

 There are only two ways for sovereigns to default: 

Inflation or collapse.    

The latter is not an option. 

 As for a solution, what‚Äôs so tragic is that the only option before the Fed is an even bigger problem‚Äîcurrent and inevitably more inflation. 

 That is, if the Fed wants to keep markets (and their job security) breathing, they no longer have the foregoing template of ‚Äúrate-hike-followed-by-rate-cutting‚Äù at their disposal, which means they now have no choice but to dovishly keep rates near the zero-bound indefinitely.

But the only way to keep rates ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù and nailed to the floor of time is to purchase otherwise unwanted bonds to keep their prices elevated and hence yields and rates repressed.

Such bond ‚Äúaccommodation,‚Äù of course, costs money, and as we already know, the only ‚Äúmoney‚Äù the Fed has to spend is the kind they create out of thin air‚Äì the very kind of money (and policy) which leads to the kind of inflation discussed above‚Äînamely, the brutal kind.

 As for that fake money, the evidence of the Fed‚Äôs desperate (and only) direction is now obvious, as the following M2 money supply makes equally clear. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v774ta55sw171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e73c839beb67a67eea9aed7de4ac61d86813840

 

Fed is so embarrassed by this ‚Äúprinting solution‚Äù that they‚Äôve stopped *weekly* reporting of M2 data, and frankly, since March, have even stopped *monthly* reporting of the same.

That, of course, is both telling as well as disgraceful‚Ä¶ The Fed literally has something to hide, and that never bodes well, does it?

&#x200B;

 The correlation to central bank balance sheet (i.e., money supply) expansion and rising markets is now beyond dispute. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sgizb6xcsw171.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=aad2fe681fe0c49ac20368aba77e86c118b22959

 In short‚Äîdo you see the correlation and pattern? Do you see how the Fed‚Äôs market sausage is made? More importantly, do you now see the Fed‚Äôs self-made conundrum? 

 

Given that the Fed bows to the markets not the people, which choice do you think they‚Äôll make?

In other words, expect more money printing and more yield curve control‚Äîand hence more money creation, more inflation, and by extension more fiat currency debasement.

 More money supply to keep rates monetized simply means more currency debasement and rising inflation.",nn51ou,"""Fed's ""Favorite"" #Inflation Indicator (PCE) Explodes At Fastest Rate Since 1992 As Incomes Crash By Record"""

I have leading indicators telling me that there are two concurrent shifts underway when it comes to who is purchasing homes.

\- Massive increase in unmarried people buying houses alone. This used to be somewhat unusual, now it's becoming very common.

\- Massive increase in unmarried men, in particular, buying houses alone. Traditionally, the female-to-male ratio of unmarried homebuyers was about 5 to 1. For the last 3 months, it's been closer to 50/50.

Source is my own closed real estate purchase transactions. Am a mortgage broker (btw this means cash purchases are ""invisible"" to me). It takes 3-6 months for [HMDA data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Mortgage_Disclosure_Act) to become accessible to journalists and academics, and thus ""visible"" to the general public (assuming journalists deem it worthy of commenting on), but I can see the trends live in real time.

How would one go about placing a bet that in about 3 or 6 months, the media, journalists, academics, etc, will pick up on this, publish articles, and potentially cause a lot of people to buy certain stocks. Which stocks would that be? Is there a ""Mancave, Inc"" out there that would potentially get an uptick? Or maybe a company making smart-home stuff that is particularly suited to renting by the room (the single men are not buying 1 bedroom condos, they are buying proper houses with 3 bedrooms, etc)?",nn76we,Homebuyer Demographics Shift towards single and male.

The above link is what I said 2 days ago. At the time EXPI was hovering around $28.50 and since then it has shot up to about $32.27 on what appears to be about average volume for the stock. 

I still think they are going to have a huge share buyback of over 14m shares (their buyback program was increased from 75m to 475m) in stock and add to the insider owned shares which is now at 54.80% over the week it has gone up about 2%. Which is a bullish signal. If 14m shares were bought that would leave about 51m shares to be traded publicly and the insider owned share percentage would go to about 62% which would be a large driving factor in the price going up due to scarcity. Also the buyback would be large enough to trigger a massive buy and I would jizz my pants.",nmnbfw,*UPDATE* Why I still Think EXPI Is Going To $60 In 4-6 Weeks (up 10.59% this week)

[When we last left our hero,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrly28/the_legend_of_utheemperorofjenks_aka_ornamental/) he had just lost all of his rent money and what he could advance from credit cards on a failed Super Bowl bet, and a YOLO on ‚ÄúRhodium‚Äù that he ordered from a sketchy Slovakian Wish.com ripoff. Alas, it was, of course, fake, and he was broke and depressed. It might have been the first fatal case of autism. He thought to himself ‚ÄúAm I really that retarded?‚Äù Then, he realized ‚ÄúNo, it must be Oklahoma that‚Äôs retarded!‚Äù

So, [after a brief case of violent diarrhea from Oklahoma Grocery Store sushi](https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/lrslbb/psa_do_not_eat_grocery_store_sushi_right_now/), he was ready to hatch his plan! Uruguay! Yes, Uruguay. [He was going to move to Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lh5igx/c%C3%B3mo_se_puede_llegar_a_melo_desde_montevideo_sin/)

His plans for this move could‚Äôve been anyone‚Äôs guess. One possibility he inquired about was [how to be a Tea Blendmaster.](https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/lfga0m/how_does_one_become_a_blendmaster/) [Another was him possibly reconnecting with God.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/lsij6j/agnostic_jew_seeking_faith_in_god/) Yet, he seemed to be asking questions about another topic more often than the others...

[Bees.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lxcnt1/c%C3%B3mo_es_la_legalidad_de_la_apicultura_informal/)

Specifically, beekeeping, a topic he admitted he had no experience in, [as evident from him looking for any book on the subject as an introduction months before.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/)

What he planned on doing with the bees was anyone‚Äôs guess, and I doubt he thought it through that much either. One post **AFTER** he took possession of 200,000 bees (we‚Äôll get to that later,) was [asking Americans if there was a demand for mead in the states.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/) So, was he thinking of importing Uruguayan honey to the US to be made into mead? Was he going to make it himself? Did he move to another continent for no reason? Let‚Äôs all find out!

A little more than 2 months ago, he finally did it. [He moved to Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/m9ejpn/la_paloma/) And about a week after that, [he was driving a truck filled with 200k bees across his new country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/) Based on replies in that thread, he was aiming to have [a monopoly on beekeeping in the country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/gt48gke/) 

And for a while, things were kind ok for our young Autist. [He picked up his hives without complication.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mtkkf3/about_to_upsize_my_apiary_whats_the_best_layout/) [And then he settled into Melo, Uruguay, and set up his apiary ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/n1jnte/my_humble_apiary_near_melo_uruguay/). Life was good.

But, trouble was afoot. According to a reply, [the species he was planning on keeping had literally never been kept by keepers in Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mtkkf3/about_to_upsize_my_apiary_whats_the_best_layout/gv0viej/) And then, disaster struck. [He went to TIFU to post his tale of spreading an invasive species in an industry he knew nothing about.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/nmd69k/tifu_by_importing_bees_to_uruguay/)

Indeed, he had no idea even what a bee was until he stumbled his way through a book, and then decided to YOLO into honey in Uruguay. He somehow got in touch with an ecology professor in Montevideo that would help him set things up in exchange for grad students fucking with them every now and again. Oh, and the bees were from fucking Myanmar. Handshake agreement, of course. Total Chad move.

And like I said before, the rest went without incident for a while. It would take the bees ‚Äúa year‚Äù to make honey, so he just kinda hung out, stayed busy, and tried to find part time work in a foreign country he arrived in 2.5 months earlier.

And then, the professor ghosted him. Just disappeared. Shortly thereafter, government agents come out about this kid from Oklahoma illegally importing a non-native bee to their country. Apparently his bees had been fucking with other apiaries. So, he did probably the smartest thing he‚Äôs ever done.

He ran.

He fucking ran from the Uruguayan government, took a plane to LAX, and arrived with $14 to his name. His friend sent him $100, which wasn‚Äôt enough to go back to Oklahoma, so he took a $75 flight to Seattle, where he is also not from.

His last post is from a train out of the airport, with $39 to his name. I don‚Äôt know what is in store for him, but I know that $39 is as good as spent on urchin futures or whatever market he‚Äôs going to crash up there.

2488,,2021-05-28 03:12:37,t3_nmofz4,,wallstreetbets,"This started as a comment reply but I thought maybe people would like reading it. I've been researching Palantir since literally late November 2020 and I have nearly my entire portfolio in LEAPS expiring January 2023. So I have continually done more research on them this is just the basics to clear up confusion and help people who don't understand it because it's hard to hear all the hype and stuff. Also AMC to the moon tomorrow for my FDs I bought!! Don't judge me it's just fun to be in on the action on weeks like this.


So you should think of palantir as basically three companies and they actually are very far from unprofitable. 

They developed the really massive government software (gotham) specifically as a result of an interaction that happened to Peter Thiel while he was at paypal. They were losing millions to foreign scammers at paypal and the solution ended up being a high quality algorithm that flagged the most likely scam transactions and then allowed analysts to efficiently double check and verify the real scam transactions.

 It essentially was using what computers are efficient at (sorting through massive amounts of data) and then combining that with what humans are good at (looking at the more complex nuances that at least at that point computer algorithms were incapable of doing) and augmenting the humans ability to make complex decisions by rapidly sorting through the incoming data and bringing everything good to their attention.

They fixed paypals using this method and literally made the company profitable overnight because of fixing how much they were losing in the scam transactions. The FBI contacted PayPal and Thiel about using that initial software. That was literally his inspiration for what would become Palantir. He goes over it in huge detail in his book zero to one. If you make an audible account you can read it for free and find the chapter I'm talking about.

Then for 15 years they perfected the government software into the absolute nearly monopoly it is now in government intelligence augmentation software. The whole time though they reinvested almost everything for the last 10 years into building the commercial software (Foundry). That side of the business has only been live for a VERY short time and initially they literally didn't spend a single dollar on marketing their first commercial clients sought THEM out because of their insane reputation with the government. Foundry helps with supply chains and all kinds of other important data  insights. But if you want a recent example the NIH and the NHS both used Foundry to figure out how to best distribute the vaccine and vaccine distribution in the US and Britain has far outpaced expectations. You think commercial companies aren't going to be interested in using the software that was literally proven on a level like that?

 They're only just now adding huge amounts of people to their sales teams literally in the last six months which if you read Peter thiels book is insane for the stock because they have this crazy long term plan and he literally talks about how when they get to a certain point and start adding sales as a full sector of the company it means that is the company the company plans to BEGIN scaling. Meaning they're this big and they literally only just started on the scaling part. Which they've also said in tons of interviews if you're a die hard Palantirian like me. 



They actually also have the third side of the  business which is their actual like full AI for weaponization and war and defense for the government. Gotham is like helping analysts and commanders lead and even helping police or agents figure out what's going on. This other software is different. It's called Apollo and its only at the beginning too. It's like pure AI machine learning AI handles everything stuff. Go find a video called pentagon head of NSC briefs public on AI I think it's on the PBS channel on YouTube or some shit. Or you can listen to Joe Biden talk about how we're going to double our percentage of gdp spending on AI. The amount of government money that's going to go into AI as a weapon to compete with China DWARFS peoples expectations of how much large the market for the kind of software palantir makes is. 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201001005334/en/U.S.-Army-Research-Lab-Selects-Palantir-Technologies-Inc.-for-91M-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-Development

This is literally the backbone of everything AI that the government is about to invest in. Sure they're going to experiment with other research but if you do research you'll also find Palantir is the ONLY company that does anything remotely like this software that has anywhere near the kind of clearances like what is required for these contracts. They are currently a clearance level 5 and about to be the highest 6. The closest competitors are almost all a 3 or lower I'm not even sure if there's more than a single 4 and that stuff is crazy hard to get. 

But like again I'm an obsessive. I realize why people get so excited about the commercial side scaling and how it's very possible and can make them huge and it will. But I'm actually pretty sure the reason people like Cathy Wood has such a huge boner for them is that she realizes how MASSIVELY. And I mean MASSIVELY underestimated the amount of government revenue they will get from all this AI investing the United States and NATO are about to do. It's literally the next Manhattan project and they're absolutely going to be one of the biggest players developing it if not the biggest. I think it's funny because most people are pretty disinterested in the government stuff for Palantir but i really think the weaponized AI apollo stuff may be as big as anything could ever be. 




Also people got the insider selling stuff very very wrong. Tom Nash (love him or hate him I don't care) has a few really good recent videos where he explains it in basically full detail what was happening. The selling panicked a lot of retail investors during a time when the buying for growth markets had really slowed because of rate hike due to inflation scares and a ton of retail holders got scared and caused more selling and more people got scared because of that and sold and it really just was mass psychology in effect and a LOT of FUD and confusion. 

Basically a few executives karp in particular got billions of dollars worth of options that vest but literally expire so you have to exercise them which means you buy shares of the company at a strike price. Well because it's the company granting shares the strike price is literally 10 cents or something and these automatically have to vest at quarterly increments. So everytime karp was exercising he's actually buying shares. Like over 150 million in total maybe a lot more million SHARES not dollars. shares. And even those when he exercising he's buying shares technically from the company it ALL counts as profit on taxes and ITS NOT LONG TERM CAP GAINS ELIGIBLE. So over the last year plus this year he's essentially getting shares but the literal dollar value of those shares to the government counts as pure profit. So his total income which he's getting taxed at 40% of is in the BILLIONS yes billions. Because that's a lot to handle people that work for them actually automatically schedule sells of shares to cover the taxes so that there's no issue it's not even like him saying sell today and they do this.... TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INSIDER SELLING TO THE SEC. That's why it's automatically happening so no one can ever claim he's timing it. 

So listen cause here's where it gets important. The exercising of the shares counts as almost pure profits but remember he's receiving SHARES not dollars he doesn't actually get billions of dollars. So has to then sell SOME of the shares so he can pays taxes on that. Then when he sells the shares to pay the taxes for exercising he actually owes even more money if they went up from when he exercised. So everytime he's selling low its actually good for him because it's less ADDITIONAL PROFIT that he would owe taxes on.

 If he wasn't selling its because he thought it would go down even further and then he would actually owe less taxes overall. So if he thought it was going to tank he'd wait and actually get a nice fat discount on his taxes. 

I know this seems really crazy but I promise that's how it works you can look it up in detail but yeah shocking that mainstream media and redditors/youtubers who barely do research and have no real understanding of how these billion dollar compensations work would get it wrong. Unbelievable I know. If he had actually sold the massive overall percentage of his shares that some people claim he did the company would be at like $3-6 dollars not low 20s. Retail got confused because of market pressured due to interest rate fears from inflation and sold low (like retail always does) to institutions.",nmofz4,"Palantir DD if you want to understand company and it's history better (also insider ""selling"" explained in detail)"

What is Blue Apron?


Blue Apron (NYSE: APRN) was the forgotten step child, bad luck Brian, IPO of summer 2017 that priced below range and had the misfortune of debuting after Amazon bought Whole Foods. Since it‚Äôs debut, the stock has suffered dropping from nearly $150 per share (adjusted for a 2019 reverse-split necessitated to stay listed) to as low as approximately $2.00!


Why the Drop?


Management. Fucking. Sucked. The prior executive team essentially handed Chad Hello Fresh the keys to the kingdom, when they made the fatal error of betting that the ‚Äúhigh affinity core users‚Äù would be enough to sustain the business. For this reason, they cut marketing to nearly nothing and attempted to realize operating leverage by shrinking the customer base only to its most prolific buyers.

This was stupid. HelloFresh did the opposite, essentially giving away meals, and they used it to stockpile market share. Put a chart up of HelloFresh customers against Blue Apron. You‚Äôll see the two lines converge and a clear indication that HelloFresh stole most of their business. HelloFresh was one of the best trades of the past 5 years. Look at the chart, look at the sales, and look at the margins. They have managed to achieve operating leverage by employing affordable pricing and emphasizing retention.


Blue Apron Might Go Under....


Today the company is in a dire place. Languishing away in Micro Cap hell at an $80M market cap, no one on Wall Street wants to cover these guys. Only their bankers, CG and MS, write them research and neither are overly optimistic. They‚Äôre in a shit spot with a credit line that mandates they keep $15M cash at all times, and they keep their customer base above 300K (thus far, they‚Äôve struggled). They‚Äôre sitting on $29M and burn enough cash per Q that they might go below that $15M level (wouldn‚Äôt be a first). All signs are negative...


But I Think They Might Win


Blue Apron is under new management. Linda Kozlowski, is the former COO of ETSY and an ex-strategist at Alibaba. She believes HelloFresh did things right and she wants to right the ship. Her ballsy-ass plan is to ride the line on cash and go all in on customer growth. She realizes those customers are worth a lot more than income on the P&L, and that she needs to make the pot as big as she can. Thus far, it‚Äôs worked. Customers are up over 20% in the past two periods and retention rates are rising. We are seeing signs of operating leverage, and it opens a big possibility.


My Prediction

Management is buying shares. They know the company is not healthy. The only logic is that they have a plan that‚Äôs working. You can‚Äôt sell a dying business with a shrinking share, but you can certainly sell a growing community, that could be an accretive asset to a better capitalized entity. I think Linda is going either get the business in a position where it can refinance for better terms, or where it can be sold to create shareholder value via a strategic alternative.

If that happen, given this is priced for bankruptcy and ignored by the Street, the returns could easily reach the triple digits. I‚Äôm long and I plan to add on additional weakness.

Everyone is talking about how the squeeze didn't even happen and the shorts didn't cover yet. What I don't understand is why wouldn't that be possible? If short interest is 17%, so let's round up to about 100M shares. Today the volume traded was 700M shares. Couldn't 100M of those 700M have been the shorts covering? And if they didn't cover, today alone 700M shares were traded, why would 100M shares bought by shorts cause a squeeze if today 700M were traded?

I have been having this question for awhile, since I noticed the same with GME. In the days preceding January 28th (when GME reached its peak), the combined volume was several times the amount of float. How come the squeeze happened and why did it happen? If the volume was so high, couldn't the shorts have covered in the days preceding that?

I hope this makes sense and I really hope someone will be kind enough to explain a fellow retard who only knows about crayons what this all means.

The plan includes creating an online ticketing platform by Great British Railways which might have a huge blow on Trainline revenue. However, this platform does not yet exist and will probably take a couple of years to develop. Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed.

In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales.  Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%.

I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time  for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

(7-14 days) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent of Modernas if not more. Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects) 

Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

Imagine if the spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize one piece to understand the whole picture it and helps modify your DNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates it can still recognize the virus. In contrast to using one portion of the picture as it mutates it's easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine, that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. Not only that but they have had the least amount of side effects of any covid vaccine deeming it the safest covid vaccine.... 

And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein (whole picture) and the safety profile. Also worth a mention is that you could store it in a regular refrigerator, and let it sit out in room temperature while you're vaccinating people instead of a special ultra low temp freeze needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers, this is a majority of the world. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines so other protein competitors will be far behind and they will have an a moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing they teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine. They will be combining flu and covid vaccine by 2025 for possibly double the price of current covid vaccine.

 They are pretty much de-risked at this point. Yes you could buy other  biotechs that can go up 20x but are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up) that has all successful trials done so far, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment to where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place there are no more glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""

They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. Yesterday at market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. 
 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

Future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract in there ( in the link below in another message). It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 

I own a lot of $250 July calls along with about 1k shares. I'm all in baby. LFG I expect to turn 200k into over a million in a year's time via shares and options

Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. This is huge as the combo is going to differentiate them especially since both flu and covid vaccines are first in class.

Looks like low volatility day. Play tight.

Note from SG: ""For todays expiration our models show about 15% SPX /30% SPY gamma expiring, which could allow volatility increase a bit into next week. This in turn may free markets for a push up into that 4250 target (Call Wall) area.""

Gamma Index: decreased to -0.1 (A large negative figure indicates volatility may be high. The range is from 4 to ‚Äì4.)

Vol Trigger: Increased to 419 (Important support and resistance level. (above this level = lower volatility and a more stable stock price.)

Abs Gamma Strike: Unchanged

Gamma Notional: Decreased to $-516 (stock has larger put gamma position. A negative gamma position implies higher volatility in the underlying)

Put Wall Support: Increased to 419 (If Put Wall shifts to a higher strike it could be a bearish indication)

Call Wall Strike: Increased to 425 (When this strike is rolled higher it is generally considered bullish)

Gamma Tilt: Decreased to 0.88	 (when decreasing it‚Äôs a bearish signal.)

Net Delta: Increased to 198k (positive delta position infers options market makers have a net long hedge.)

25d risk reversal: Increased to -0.06 (When the ratio shifts towards 0 it indicates call demand)

1) We look to the PTON CFO's statement found in the latest earnings call transcript, for guidance:
""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior.""
2) Being that we do not have access to a 10-K filing for Q4 fiscal '19, we will access other filings that do in fact reference numbers from fiscal '19...
A) 10-K filing dated 9/11/2020
B) 10-Q filing dated 5/6/2020
3) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $223.3M under Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19)
But, that is TOTAL Revenue; we need to find out what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike sales...
4) To calculate what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike Sales, we can use numbers from neighboring Q3 (i.e. Three Months Ended March 31, 2019)...
A) On page 6 of the 10-Q, you will find Revenue of ""Connected Fitness Products"" (aka Bike Sales) to be $261.6M
B) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $316.7M
C) % of Bike Sales per TOTAL Revenue: $261.6M / $316.7M * 100 = 82.6% {""Connected Fitness Products"" Revenue (aka Bike Sales)}
5) Apply 82.6% to the TOTAL Revenue $223.3M for Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19): $223.3M x 0.826 = $184.45M {Bike Sales for Q4 of fiscal '19}
6) Per the CFO, ""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior."":

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote... By mid-July, we‚Äôll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase precious metals  especially silver amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative 

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

Gold rose over 60% in the 1930s as the prices of stocks and real estate crashed. You could buy an entire block with a one ounce gold coin. Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms.

I must address Cramer's statement because he is obviously trying to add fuel to the short-selling fire: When he says ""we're not going natural gas"" he is clearly making a vague and general statement meant to be interpreted in the worst possible way: ""no one is going to buy or use natural gas."" By now, I hope everyone that is interested in this stock understands that CLNE offers an alternative transportation fuel, thus, the investments made by BP and Chevron, and not revolutionary technology like some EV's (but this is mostly hype meant to catapult EVs to the front. What most people do not realize is that driverless technology and such can be placed in Petro vehicles too). Also, unfortunately, the company has done a terrible marketting job. That's why powerful analysts can get away with making vague and unsupported statements. The fact that Cramer explained the stock's decrease over the last month as being due to widespread dissaproval is misleading, at best. Many people do not yet know about the cleanliness and therapeutic effects RNG has on the climate.

The News...

If you haven't read yet it looks like Federal Cannabis legalization my be around the corner. [Here](https://www.mpp.org/policy/federal/the-more-act/) is the House Bill. Supporters seem on board and like the reforms they have done to the bill including rescheduling cannabis. [Last time](https://mjbizdaily.com/key-us-house-lawmaker-reintroduces-federal-marijuana-legalization-bill/) the bill was introduced it cleared the House.   


Personally I think this gets a lot of support especially from a fiscal point of view. With stimulus stalling and a giant debate going on about how to pay for the stimulus I think cannabis offers the easiest way to collect federal revenue. A simple review of the bill and the fiscal benefits to the Fed's can be read [here](https://www.justtherealnews.com/congress/nadler-blumenauer-lee-jackson-lee-jeffries-velazquez-reintroduce-comprehensive-marijuana-reform-legislation/). The bill states a 5% fed tax. Money coming for uncle Sam, right when questions about paying for stimulus.... Personally I think it adds up, but that's for you to decide. 

Okay so that's the hype...

Let's talk about the tickers listed ($SNDL and $TLRY). 

$SNDL

I'll start with the cheaper YOLO, $SNDL. $SNDL short interest isn't high, but the company did issue convertible notes a while back around .7c if my memory is correct. I'm not saying they won't do it again, but they should be in a good place fiscally for now. Float is high with about 1.6B shares out there. However today's volume at the time of writing is over 415M. That's not bad given such a high float. It's about 200% more than the average volume. 

The options chain on $SNDL has me giddy. With over 200,000 options currently in the money on todays move above $1 there is some high potential here for some interesting action. The put to call ratio is just obnoxiously low at .08 it's screaming upwards betting. If we hold above $1 the potential squeeze up could be amazing.   


It's also broken up on the trend lines and out of the downward channel it was in. The regression channel from the peak squeeze back in Feb just broke out today according to my crayons I have laying around. 

$TLRY

$TLRY was the squeeze of a lifetime if you remember it back in 19'. The ticker was just a money printer with it's low float and stupid hype. Then they proceeded to do, like they all do, and issue debt. Shares tumbled since then falling from $120 --> $5. Ouch bag holders.   


Like all the cannabis stocks the Feb bump pushed $TLRY to above $60 in an amazing move. $TLRY has a lower short interest than $SNDL, but it also has a much lower float at about 300M. Compared to $SNDL the volume here isn't as good, but still remains decently above the avg volume around 36M as of right now. 

If we peep the options chain we also see a crazy low P/C ratio around .11. But we don't have the Open Interest in the chain like $SNDL does unless you roll out to Jun 18. Then we finally get some decent OI.   


Personally I am going with $SNDL. The option's chain looks better, the stock is cheaper, and the short interest is a little better. My advice would be to roll out till at least the Jun 11th $1 strike to not get eaten alive by Theta and IV crush. But WSB does what WSB wants and that's why I love you all.   
Do not go above the $2 strikes IMO. You will get crushed by theta unless we get an insane move, which could happen but I don't see the risk / reward there.",nn326f,MORE ACT / CANNABIS / $SNDL & $TLRY Potential

>A corner in the silver market has been tried before - and let's be clear, that is what is being attempted now.  In 1980, a rule change by the government destroyed the corner.  #silverthursday.

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday

>Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers‚Äô attempt to corner the market on the metal.

-
>Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926‚Äì2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers‚Äô Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.

-
>By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50.

Tl;dr

This is an extensive, in-depth due-diligence document, and I realize that ‚Äúain‚Äôt nobody got time for that‚Äù. So I have decided to do God‚Äôs work for him and put the tl;dr at the start, saving you all a couple hours read.

* Henrik Fisker is a God among men in the automotive industry - trust him to do right
* Geeta Gupta-Fisker is a solid Chief Financial Officer with experience in investment banking - she will ensure the shares are valued right
* Henrik has learned from all the mistakes he made with his previous attempt to create Fisker Automotive, and will certainly do everything in his power to avoid that mess again. He has designed systems into the intricacies of the company to avoid failure - meaning Fisker Inc is guaranteed to succeed
* Henrik Fisker on shorting $FSR - ‚ÄúYou will quickly understand that you stand to lose a lot of money if you show it against Fisker‚Äù
* Production of Fisker Ocean expected to start in November 2022
* 250,000+ units a year expected by 2025
* Partnerships with Foxconn and Magna Steyr, both giants in their respective industries, among others
* Large Fleet market in Europe gaining momentum, and 700+ Fisker reservations in this market alone
* 16,000+ reservations already. More than Tesla had 18 months pre-production
* Revenue streams include leasing automotives, servicing, selling emissions credits, selling insurance (like selling the pickaxe to miners, and selling the diamonds to the mine owners too, absolutely genius - Fisker are insuring cars which they own, because the customer is only leasing it)
* High short interest (20%+), high analyst price targets compared to current share price (100%+) and low valuation compared to peers ($3bn market cap currently)
* Designing the first ever all-electric popemobile - Massive, soon to be historic, event!
* I give $FSR (currently $13 a share) a price target of $100 by end of year 2022, if not sooner
* Price Targets: $35 by end of year - Previous ATH. $50 start of next year - European and Chinese debut of prototypes. $100 end of 2022 - start of production (SOP). $150+ 2023
* 2025 Price Targets, calculated using projected data: Bear case - $97 a share, Bull case - $519 a share
* Downside in the short term is capped by the large amount of cash on hand - one third of market cap is cash. Long term, is capped by risk factors, which are almost eligible and affect every automotive startup anyway.

In 2007, Tesla Motors hired Henrik Fisker to perform initial design work on the Tesla Model S electric sedan, which was introduced in 2012.

Fisker stated in 2018 that, with the growth of car-sharing, ride-hailing, and autonomous shuttles, he believes within 10 years private cars will be used for less than half of what they are currently used for.

&#x200B;

## Fisker Automotive

In 2008, Fisker Automotive raised over $90 million from investors including venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. In September 2009, Fisker Automotive was awarded a $528 million loan guarantee by the United States Department of Energy (DOE). The automaker was one of four recipients of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, to encourage the domestic manufacture of electric cars. The funds were to be used to develop the Karma, as well as an affordable family-size plug-in hybrid car. The loan facility was frozen at $192 million in February 2012, after the DOE claimed that Fisker missed its milestones

In December 2011, just as the Fisker Karma was launched, its battery supplier, A123 Systems, recalled all batteries, followed by a second recall in 2012. A123 filed for bankruptcy in October 2012, leaving Fisker Automotive without a battery supplier. After selling approximately 2,000 units, production of the Fisker Karma was suspended in November 2012, in the absence of its battery supplier.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/59vfj5wa8w171.png?width=511&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1c03d1e1254fea00c195776122de2b26099dd35

Henrik Fisker resigned as chairman from Fisker Automotive in March 2013, because of disagreements with management about business strategy. Later that year, the company declared voluntary bankruptcy.Fisker raised and spent more than a billion dollars over its lifetime.The heart of Fisker‚Äôs business model was in that early deal with Quantum. The idea was to design a gorgeous car, and have suppliers like Quantum provide the technology because off-the-shelf parts from suppliers would help keep costs down.

But there were problems with this strategy: Sometimes, those parts had to be custom-made to fit the design vision, which resulted in higher prices for Fisker. Other times, parts were delivered late or, worse, faulty, but Fisker was locked in to those supplier relationships. Sources close to Fisker have also said that many of the parts were owned by the suppliers themselves, so Fisker didn‚Äôt own a lot of the internal technology.

The broker that raised funds for Fisker automotive, by selling their private shares, was Advanced Equities.It wasn‚Äôt until December 2011 and into 2012 that the more dubious efforts of Advanced Equities became clearer to Fisker‚Äôs hundreds of investors. The last few hundred million dollars of Advanced Equities‚Äô fund raising for Fisker, starting with the D-1 round, was what brokers call ‚Äúpay to play.‚Äù As Fisker was running into technical, delivery and political problems, its valuation was quickly declining. But the company still needed more money, so the brokers went back to its current investors and said: Unless you give this more, your current shares will be diluted and your preferred stock will be converted to common stock.

It was essentially a gun to their heads. This is why investor Wray sued Fisker in February 2012, alleging he was on the receiving end of this tactic. In his lawsuit, he says Advanced Equities sent him a letter dated Jan. 18, 2012, stating that he needed to decide if he wanted to invest in Fisker‚Äôs next round, and pay around $84,000 by Jan. 27, 2012 ‚Äî a little over a week from receiving the letter. He also says that Advanced Equities assured him that he would have anti-dilution protection. According to the audio clip from Advanced Equities‚Äô internal sales call in early 2010, Advanced Equity leaders say that the Fisker deal will ‚Äúsuffer no dilution,‚Äù and was ‚Äúa dream scenario.‚Äù

That dream would soon end. In September 2012 after Fisker closed on $1.2 billion in funding, the bulk of it organized by Advanced Equities, the SEC charged the broker with misleading investors when it raised money for another company back in 2009 and 2010 (Bloom Energy). Advanced settled, agreeing to pay $1 million, and its co-founders were personally fined. Two months later Advanced Equities closed up shop.

Later, A123 Systems itself went bankrupt, causing more problems for Fisker. Fisker claimed that A123 Systems owed it $140 million, but a bankruptcy settlement reduced that to a paltry $15 million.

Then there was the just plain terrible luck for the ironically named Karma: Super Storm Sandy wiped out 338 of its Karmas in storage in New Jersey. The cars first drowned, and then caught on fire ‚Äî salt water damage caused a short circuit that was spread to other cars by high winds, Fisker said at the time.

With all of this happening in public ‚Äî and in a presidential election year ‚Äî Fisker‚Äôs struggles became highly politicized. The company was mentioned numerous times in presidential debates and speeches leading up to the election. Republican nominee Romney called Fisker and other DOE-supported companies losers.

The company didn‚Äôt seem to invest substantially in technology innovation or tech IP, and seemed to spend a disproportionate amount on suppliers. For example, numerous sources have said that the company paid upfront for 15,000 of some of the parts for its planned 15,000 Karmas. It ended up only selling around 2,000 of the cars. It has also been said that Fisker paid some funds upfront to have BMW make engines for the 100,000 Nina cars it hoped to produce ‚Äî in the end, Fisker didn‚Äôt deliver a single Nina.

Costs to build each Karma also creeped up because the company missed its volume targets, and because engineering had to change designs around supplier constraints. The company ended up adding $20,000 to its initial sale price.

Expensive hires may also have sucked away chunks of Fisker‚Äôs funding: Sources say that Fisker filled the upper levels of the company with seasoned auto executives from Detroit. At the high point of Fisker, the company had around 300 employees, plus dozens of contract staff. Bringing in a certain amount of the old guard could help a car startup ramp up quickly, and also impress potential investors with ‚Äúindustry names.‚Äù But those people are also used to big auto-industry budgets that included extensive travel and salaries ‚Äî that‚Äôs the opposite life of a tech startup.

## Fisker Inc.

In July 2016, Henrik Fisker expressed interest in designing a fully connected electric car with autonomous driving features and an aesthetically pleasing look. He has pursued battery technology, and hinted at potentially reviving the Fisker name with a pure-electric vehicle using technology that nobody else has. Since then Fisker has talked about delays to the promised solid state battery technology, which he does not expect to be able to be produced in volume until at least 2025. Posing risk for competition from more scientifically experienced future solid state battery producers such as Quantumscape.

***Forbes:*** ‚ÄúNow he‚Äôs back‚Äìand three things are different. First and foremost, he has a vital new partner: his wife, cofounder and Fisker Inc. CFO Geeta Gupta-Fisker. Second, his Los Angeles-based company is public this time around, raising more than $1 billion in an October 2020 IPO. And finally, Fisker‚Äôs stock price, up 56% since its debut, has made both Henrik and Geeta billionaires, each worth about $1.1 billion as of Friday‚Äôs market close. The auto industry has seen father-son and sibling leadership teams, but Fisker Inc.‚Äôs CEO-CFO combo is the fast-changing sector‚Äôs first husband and wife power couple.‚Äù

Wealth isn‚Äôt the purpose of the new company, Henrik says. ‚ÄúI never got into cars because of money. (This shows he is willing to do what is in the best interest of the company because he is not motivated by money, unlike 99% of other CEO‚Äôs)

The couple sought a big stake in the new venture to ensure they can control its fate in a way Fisker couldn‚Äôt with his earlier company.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yzhded6pfw171.png?width=408&format=png&auto=webp&s=54b30259720cf853a8efeacf058f2f74315260b9

Henrik is an auto industry celebrity, but Geeta‚Äôs background is equally impressive. A native of India, she holds multiple degrees in science, including a Ph.D. in biotechnology from Cambridge University where she was also a Research Newton Fellow. From there, she started a career in international investment for Lloyds Banking Group, and then managed investments for a high-net-worth client for several years. (In particular, this is insanely important - Geeta **KNOWS MONEY**! She knows how best to keep a company afloat, organize its share structure, provide value to shareholders, etc. because she has worked in the industry before. She may just be the most important element of Fisker Inc., due to the financial experience she has. At every step of the way, she is likely to make decisions with one sole focus - increasing share price and value).

She met her future husband in 2011 when he was visiting London, just before things started going very wrong at Fisker Automotive. They married in 2012.

‚ÄúWhen I left Fisker Automotive, all I had was my car,‚Äù Henrik remembers. ‚ÄúI'm in a different position, mainly because of Geeta. Because she cuts the deals.‚Äù

To get the new venture off the ground, the Fiskers invested the majority of their life savings‚Äìan enormous financial risk given the fate of Henrik‚Äôs prior company. Then, just as they were locking in plans for the IPO back in July, they were hit by a highly unwelcome complication: Geeta learned she had early-stage breast cancer.

‚ÄúShe got the call (from her doctor) during a call with investors,‚Äù Henrik says. Despite that bombshell, she continued working with banks and investors in the weeks that followed, even as she underwent two surgical procedures and radiation therapy. Her medical therapy concluded in November.

Henrik, who marvels at her fortitude throughout the health crisis says, ‚Äúshe only missed something like one day of work...That's just how she is. She works tirelessly.‚Äù

## Fisker Ocean

The Fisker Ocean will have a nearly 300-mile range with an 80 kWh battery and a solar panel roof as a range extender, adding approximately 1,000 free miles of range per year. Advanced electronics will be housed under the hood, and the vehicle will incorporate recycled and sustainable materials throughout. Deliveries of the Ocean are scheduled to begin in 2022.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s87j6bdsfw171.png?width=438&format=png&auto=webp&s=e40add9ce53319d31db242cce73a303afb03cbab

Fisker has also announced a partnership with Electrify America to ensure Fisker Ocean vehicles will integrate seamlessly with Electrify America charging stations when the e-SUV hits the market. With features such as a solar roof and recycled inner materials, it will be, according to Fisker Inc., the ""world's most sustainable vehicle.""

In 2017, Fisker Inc. announced that it had filed patents on flexible solid-state battery designs. Fisker expected the batteries to be produced on a mass scale around 2020. A prototype of the battery debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018. In October 2018, Fisker announced new funding for battery development through Caterpillar Venture Capital. The solid-state batteries are intended to deliver longer vehicle range and faster charging times.

In 2018, Fisker was named to the board of directors of First Cobalt, a North American cobalt refinery that produces battery materials.

In September 2019, it was announced that Fisker Inc. was partnering with Game of Thrones actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who will serve as a partner and sustainability adviser to Fisker, to work on advanced, affordable, electric mobility models.

&#x200B;

[In addition to being a well-known actor, Coster-Waldau is also the United Nations Development Program Goodwill Ambassador for climate change and other social issues.](https://preview.redd.it/3hssff5vfw171.png?width=451&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebe55e2468c5b63d1bc0ac3c71547219dff5afaa)

Nikolaj wrote this piece about Fisker:

To quote a friend of mine who is a lot smarter than me, architect Bjarke Ingels: ‚ÄúThe idea that sustainability needs to sacrifice quality of life is a flawed one. It‚Äôs a design challenge, a challenge to build something that transforms the idea of sustainability into something that will increase the quality of life for all those around it.‚Äù

One person meeting that challenge is Henrik Fisker, who has designed some of the most iconic cars over the past decades for BMW and others, like the BMW Z8, Aston Martin DB9 and Aston Martin V8 Vantage. He‚Äôs a hero for gas-guzzling supercars. He is a fellow Dane, I am a fan, and we met, of all places, on Twitter.

When we met in person, he described his new project ‚Äî an all-electric luxury SUV ‚Äî and asked me if I would help spread the word on his car. The problem as I see it with most electric cars is that they only accomplish the basics. They get you from point A to B. They run electric so you don‚Äôt pollute while driving, but that‚Äôs it. They are basically unattractive combustion engine cars that have a battery thrown into them ‚Äî and for most of them, a battery with a limited range. What Fisker does is to try to make every part of the car in a sustainable and attractive way, like a full-length solar roof, recycled floor mats and vegan leather seats. It looks incredibly cool and inviting, with a great 250- to 300-mile range, and at a cost of just under $40,000, it‚Äôs a luxury car affordable to a mass market.

I said yes and even became an investor, not only because it‚Äôs a great car but more importantly, I hope and believe it can inspire other companies to actively incorporate sustainability goals into all aspects of their business. Fisker then had the idea of calling me ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù adviser. Which I am not. Just to be clear. Thanks Henrik, sounds cool, but I am an actor and a citizen, and that‚Äôs really it.

And what about Hollywood? Is our industry changing, are we at the forefront? Looking at social media, you would think so. And things are happening, but usually only when a camera is pointed at people. Remember a few years back when all awards shows only used EVs for the red carpet? We made a difference. We mattered. We showed the way. So cool. So green, so ‚Ä¶ brief. Now it‚Äôs back to the Escalade. But hey, we are not using plastic straws anymore!

To believe that change will come from Hollywood is not really based in reality (when did that stop us?), but we are great at reacting ‚Äî and things around us are changing, and changing us. I have a good friend who loves his SUV. It‚Äôs not electric. But he cannot give up his car. He is a good guy, he‚Äôs works for the U.N., so if he has a problem going electric, we all do. But if he is presented with an alternative that doesn‚Äôt mean a reduction in his quality of life, something like the Fisker SUV, I think he‚Äôd transition to electric in a heartbeat.

The IPO deal values Fisker Inc at US$2.9 billion, with an IPO share price of $10.

On July 30, 2020, Fisker announced plans for a four-vehicle portfolio by 2025. The Fisker Ocean SUV will be joined by a sports sedan based on their previously announced Fisker Emotion concept, a coupe-like SUV, and a lifestyle pickup truck. All will be electric vehicles.

On October 15, 2020, Fisker Inc announced it would be outsourcing vehicle production of its Fisker Ocean electric SUV to Magna Steyr, to reduce the complexities and costs related to the building and operating its own factory. Magna will start building the Fisker Ocean in Europe in 2022.

## Henrik Fisker Interview quotes:

I have people on Twitter saying, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just make the car next month? You have a prototype.‚Äù Most people don‚Äôt understand that it takes 18 months to do long-lead body tooling for high-volume vehicles. Most people don‚Äôt understand it takes two years to do durability tests and do all the engineering certification and everything else.

And on the business model itself, I believe that there is nobody in the near future or the next couple of years that‚Äôs going to make a million EVs on one model. Today, there‚Äôs nobody doing it. Tesla probably has the highest volume of one single model, a couple hundred thousand. But even the big giant established carmakers are not making, right now, a couple hundred thousand vehicles of one model. So the way you get volume, in my view, is if you partner up with other OEMs and share some of the expensive parts of the platform, which in my view is not anymore something that is unique IP or something that is a unique experience to the customer. An aluminum stamped floor or a steel stamped floor really doesn‚Äôt have any brand value anymore.

And obviously, as we move forward, we always start to do some of the things ourselves. But it was really about de-risking in our first vehicle to market. So we‚Äôre going to do another three vehicles, which we can do because we don‚Äôt have to spend all our money and effort on learning how to manufacture a car, for instance.

So we have programmed a lot. We have hired a head of ESG, environmental and social governance, and he is really spearheading developing specific... we kind of put out some goals that we would like to reach with suppliers, and we at least try to bring them in that direction. They are not reaching those goals right now, but they may reach them later. And then we have goals for ourselves. So for instance, we look at transport. Are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs closer to the plant, or are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs on the other side of the planet that way we have to then transport all that stuff. So those are the types of things that we‚Äôre really thinking about now as we‚Äôre nominating suppliers. And finally, materials as well, looking at sustainable materials. We‚Äôve actually picked up a lot of knowledge on that side as well, where we are adding more sustainable materials to our vehicle. So we are actually looking across everything ‚Äî supply chain, where the suppliers are located, what the suppliers are doing for sustainability, and also then of course in the vehicle itself ‚Äî in terms of the type of materials there.

**Fisker Flexible Platform Adaptive Design (FF-PAD)** \- FF-PAD is a Fisker proprietary process that allows the development and design of a vehicle to be adapted to any Fisker-qualified EV platform in the specific segment size. *It de-risks the business model and significantly reduces time and capital intensity associated with vehicle development and manufacturing engineering*.

Benefits / Proof-Points:

‚ñ™ Built drivable prototype in 7 weeks from receipt of platform data

‚ñ™ 29-month Ocean development timing (2-3 year savings)

‚ñ™ Magna architecture in development since 2018. Without FF-PAD, Fisker would have needed to be involved from that date.

Fisker targets 4 unique vehicle models on the market by 2025YE

MEDIUM-TERM OPERATING MODEL:

Targeting annual volume of 200,000-250,000 units by 2025 (under review pending finalized agreement with Foxconn)

Projecting mid-$50k Avg. selling price (ASP) at Ocean maturity (slightly below midpoint of price range)

Platform-sharing, contract manufacturing, outsourced service, digital sales / distribution, and organic marketing supports meaningfully lower OpEx spend vs. competitors.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nb8ozukrpw171.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd5a515f831dedcc57b25d717c5c133c0c74299d

So - let's summarize - prices are rising at their fastest pace in almost 30 years and incomes just plunged by their most ever! We're gonna need more stimmies!""  

Plus  to above; 

Last year, Hirschman Capital noted that since 1821, 98% of sovereigns that hit 130% debt/GDP have defaulted on their sovereign debt.   

The US hit 130% late last year. 

Simple Conclussion : The Fed can‚Äôt go ‚Äúhawkish‚Äù and raise rates without sending markets ‚Äìand economies‚Äìto their knees; by extension, they now have nothing left to ‚Äúcut‚Äù when the current everything bubble implodes.

And that  is a *real problem*.

 There are only two ways for sovereigns to default: 

Inflation or collapse.    

The latter is not an option. 

 As for a solution, what‚Äôs so tragic is that the only option before the Fed is an even bigger problem‚Äîcurrent and inevitably more inflation. 

 That is, if the Fed wants to keep markets (and their job security) breathing, they no longer have the foregoing template of ‚Äúrate-hike-followed-by-rate-cutting‚Äù at their disposal, which means they now have no choice but to dovishly keep rates near the zero-bound indefinitely.

But the only way to keep rates ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù and nailed to the floor of time is to purchase otherwise unwanted bonds to keep their prices elevated and hence yields and rates repressed.

Such bond ‚Äúaccommodation,‚Äù of course, costs money, and as we already know, the only ‚Äúmoney‚Äù the Fed has to spend is the kind they create out of thin air‚Äì the very kind of money (and policy) which leads to the kind of inflation discussed above‚Äînamely, the brutal kind.

 As for that fake money, the evidence of the Fed‚Äôs desperate (and only) direction is now obvious, as the following M2 money supply makes equally clear. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v774ta55sw171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e73c839beb67a67eea9aed7de4ac61d86813840

 

Fed is so embarrassed by this ‚Äúprinting solution‚Äù that they‚Äôve stopped *weekly* reporting of M2 data, and frankly, since March, have even stopped *monthly* reporting of the same.

That, of course, is both telling as well as disgraceful‚Ä¶ The Fed literally has something to hide, and that never bodes well, does it?

&#x200B;

 The correlation to central bank balance sheet (i.e., money supply) expansion and rising markets is now beyond dispute. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sgizb6xcsw171.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=aad2fe681fe0c49ac20368aba77e86c118b22959

 In short‚Äîdo you see the correlation and pattern? Do you see how the Fed‚Äôs market sausage is made? More importantly, do you now see the Fed‚Äôs self-made conundrum? 

 

Given that the Fed bows to the markets not the people, which choice do you think they‚Äôll make?

In other words, expect more money printing and more yield curve control‚Äîand hence more money creation, more inflation, and by extension more fiat currency debasement.

 More money supply to keep rates monetized simply means more currency debasement and rising inflation.",nn51ou,"""Fed's ""Favorite"" #Inflation Indicator (PCE) Explodes At Fastest Rate Since 1992 As Incomes Crash By Record"""

2557,,2021-05-28 20:45:08,t3_nn76we,,wallstreetbets,"TLDR:

I have leading indicators telling me that there are two concurrent shifts underway when it comes to who is purchasing homes.

\- Massive increase in unmarried people buying houses alone. This used to be somewhat unusual, now it's becoming very common.

\- Massive increase in unmarried men, in particular, buying houses alone. Traditionally, the female-to-male ratio of unmarried homebuyers was about 5 to 1. For the last 3 months, it's been closer to 50/50.

Source is my own closed real estate purchase transactions. Am a mortgage broker (btw this means cash purchases are ""invisible"" to me). It takes 3-6 months for [HMDA data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Mortgage_Disclosure_Act) to become accessible to journalists and academics, and thus ""visible"" to the general public (assuming journalists deem it worthy of commenting on), but I can see the trends live in real time.

How would one go about placing a bet that in about 3 or 6 months, the media, journalists, academics, etc, will pick up on this, publish articles, and potentially cause a lot of people to buy certain stocks. Which stocks would that be? Is there a ""Mancave, Inc"" out there that would potentially get an uptick? Or maybe a company making smart-home stuff that is particularly suited to renting by the room (the single men are not buying 1 bedroom condos, they are buying proper houses with 3 bedrooms, etc)?

EDIT: oh, and to be clear. It's not just an uptick in single men. It's an uptick in women too, but a massive surge from the men. It used to be that for 15 banana sales, 10 are to married couples, 4 to single women, and 1 to a single man. Now for the same 15 banana sales, it's 6 to married couples, 6 to single women, and 3 to single men, something like that.",nn76we,Homebuyer Demographics Shift towards single and male. How to bet?

1. They can rise rates, have raised rates before, and literally WILL raise rates in the future. JPOW doesn't give a fuck about you or any retard placing degen bets. Corrections will wipe out overleveraged retards and call only chimps, but anyone with C grade plus IQ will get the hints.

Just yesterday someone said, AMC $50. And other peeps laughed. But it could have just as easily topped at $50 as it did $35 on a day like today, a Friday ahead of a holiday. This $25 looks like a natural consolidation area, similar to the $10 had been, and may well be again. Who knows. Again, this is not a rational way.

Phones can become cheaper (lower prices) over a period of 10 years even as the money supply increases dramatically (inflation). One of the reason we don't see very many things go down in price (vehicles, housing, healthcare, etc.) despite massive productivity gains is because of inflation. Prices would otherwise go down (cheaper both nominally and in real terms). Instead, prices are now mostly stable or increase slightly every year because our policy is to steadily inflate the money supply over time. This is the same reason a good job used to pay $100 a week; now the same job pays $2000 a week.

Don't confuse velocity, money supply, inflation/deflation, price theory, and supply and demand. These are all very discrete concepts. It gets complicated when you factor in credit expansion and fractional reserve lending, but at its heart inflation is a simple monetary phenomenon, and our currency is permanently inflated in only one place (otherwise it's called ""counterfeiting"").",,

I still think they are going to have a huge share buyback of over 14m shares (their buyback program was increased from 75m to 475m) in stock and add to the insider owned shares which is now at 54.80% over the week it has gone up about 2%. Which is a bullish signal. If 14m shares were bought that would leave about 51m shares to be traded publicly and the insider owned share percentage would go to about 62% which would be a large driving factor in the price going up due to scarcity. Also the buyback would be large enough to trigger a massive buy and I would jizz my pants.",nmnbfw,*UPDATE* Why I still Think EXPI Is Going To $60 In 4-6 Weeks (up 10.59% this week)

[When we last left our hero,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrly28/the_legend_of_utheemperorofjenks_aka_ornamental/) he had just lost all of his rent money and what he could advance from credit cards on a failed Super Bowl bet, and a YOLO on ‚ÄúRhodium‚Äù that he ordered from a sketchy Slovakian Wish.com ripoff. Alas, it was, of course, fake, and he was broke and depressed. It might have been the first fatal case of autism. He thought to himself ‚ÄúAm I really that retarded?‚Äù Then, he realized ‚ÄúNo, it must be Oklahoma that‚Äôs retarded!‚Äù

So, [after a brief case of violent diarrhea from Oklahoma Grocery Store sushi](https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/lrslbb/psa_do_not_eat_grocery_store_sushi_right_now/), he was ready to hatch his plan! Uruguay! Yes, Uruguay. [He was going to move to Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lh5igx/c%C3%B3mo_se_puede_llegar_a_melo_desde_montevideo_sin/)

His plans for this move could‚Äôve been anyone‚Äôs guess. One possibility he inquired about was [how to be a Tea Blendmaster.](https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/lfga0m/how_does_one_become_a_blendmaster/) [Another was him possibly reconnecting with God.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/lsij6j/agnostic_jew_seeking_faith_in_god/) Yet, he seemed to be asking questions about another topic more often than the others...

[Bees.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lxcnt1/c%C3%B3mo_es_la_legalidad_de_la_apicultura_informal/)

Specifically, beekeeping, a topic he admitted he had no experience in, [as evident from him looking for any book on the subject as an introduction months before.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/)

What he planned on doing with the bees was anyone‚Äôs guess, and I doubt he thought it through that much either. One post **AFTER** he took possession of 200,000 bees (we‚Äôll get to that later,) was [asking Americans if there was a demand for mead in the states.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/) So, was he thinking of importing Uruguayan honey to the US to be made into mead? Was he going to make it himself? Did he move to another continent for no reason? Let‚Äôs all find out!

A little more than 2 months ago, he finally did it. [He moved to Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/m9ejpn/la_paloma/) And about a week after that, [he was driving a truck filled with 200k bees across his new country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/) Based on replies in that thread, he was aiming to have [a monopoly on beekeeping in the country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/gt48gke/) 

And for a while, things were kind ok for our young Autist. [He picked up his hives without complication.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mtkkf3/about_to_upsize_my_apiary_whats_the_best_layout/) [And then he settled into Melo, Uruguay, and set up his apiary ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/n1jnte/my_humble_apiary_near_melo_uruguay/). Life was good.

But, trouble was afoot. According to a reply, [the species he was planning on keeping had literally never been kept by keepers in Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mtkkf3/about_to_upsize_my_apiary_whats_the_best_layout/gv0viej/) And then, disaster struck. [He went to TIFU to post his tale of spreading an invasive species in an industry he knew nothing about.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/nmd69k/tifu_by_importing_bees_to_uruguay/)

Indeed, he had no idea even what a bee was until he stumbled his way through a book, and then decided to YOLO into honey in Uruguay. He somehow got in touch with an ecology professor in Montevideo that would help him set things up in exchange for grad students fucking with them every now and again. Oh, and the bees were from fucking Myanmar. Handshake agreement, of course. Total Chad move.

And like I said before, the rest went without incident for a while. It would take the bees ‚Äúa year‚Äù to make honey, so he just kinda hung out, stayed busy, and tried to find part time work in a foreign country he arrived in 2.5 months earlier.

And then, the professor ghosted him. Just disappeared. Shortly thereafter, government agents come out about this kid from Oklahoma illegally importing a non-native bee to their country. Apparently his bees had been fucking with other apiaries. So, he did probably the smartest thing he‚Äôs ever done.

He ran.

He fucking ran from the Uruguayan government, took a plane to LAX, and arrived with $14 to his name. His friend sent him $100, which wasn‚Äôt enough to go back to Oklahoma, so he took a $75 flight to Seattle, where he is also not from.

His last post is from a train out of the airport, with $39 to his name. I don‚Äôt know what is in store for him, but I know that $39 is as good as spent on urchin futures or whatever market he‚Äôs going to crash up there.

3274,,2021-05-28 03:12:37,t3_nmofz4,,wallstreetbets,"This started as a comment reply but I thought maybe people would like reading it. I've been researching Palantir since literally late November 2020 and I have nearly my entire portfolio in LEAPS expiring January 2023. So I have continually done more research on them this is just the basics to clear up confusion and help people who don't understand it because it's hard to hear all the hype and stuff. Also AMC to the moon tomorrow for my FDs I bought!! Don't judge me it's just fun to be in on the action on weeks like this.


So you should think of palantir as basically three companies and they actually are very far from unprofitable. 

They developed the really massive government software (gotham) specifically as a result of an interaction that happened to Peter Thiel while he was at paypal. They were losing millions to foreign scammers at paypal and the solution ended up being a high quality algorithm that flagged the most likely scam transactions and then allowed analysts to efficiently double check and verify the real scam transactions.

 It essentially was using what computers are efficient at (sorting through massive amounts of data) and then combining that with what humans are good at (looking at the more complex nuances that at least at that point computer algorithms were incapable of doing) and augmenting the humans ability to make complex decisions by rapidly sorting through the incoming data and bringing everything good to their attention.

They fixed paypals using this method and literally made the company profitable overnight because of fixing how much they were losing in the scam transactions. The FBI contacted PayPal and Thiel about using that initial software. That was literally his inspiration for what would become Palantir. He goes over it in huge detail in his book zero to one. If you make an audible account you can read it for free and find the chapter I'm talking about.

Then for 15 years they perfected the government software into the absolute nearly monopoly it is now in government intelligence augmentation software. The whole time though they reinvested almost everything for the last 10 years into building the commercial software (Foundry). That side of the business has only been live for a VERY short time and initially they literally didn't spend a single dollar on marketing their first commercial clients sought THEM out because of their insane reputation with the government. Foundry helps with supply chains and all kinds of other important data  insights. But if you want a recent example the NIH and the NHS both used Foundry to figure out how to best distribute the vaccine and vaccine distribution in the US and Britain has far outpaced expectations. You think commercial companies aren't going to be interested in using the software that was literally proven on a level like that?

 They're only just now adding huge amounts of people to their sales teams literally in the last six months which if you read Peter thiels book is insane for the stock because they have this crazy long term plan and he literally talks about how when they get to a certain point and start adding sales as a full sector of the company it means that is the company the company plans to BEGIN scaling. Meaning they're this big and they literally only just started on the scaling part. Which they've also said in tons of interviews if you're a die hard Palantirian like me. 



They actually also have the third side of the  business which is their actual like full AI for weaponization and war and defense for the government. Gotham is like helping analysts and commanders lead and even helping police or agents figure out what's going on. This other software is different. It's called Apollo and its only at the beginning too. It's like pure AI machine learning AI handles everything stuff. Go find a video called pentagon head of NSC briefs public on AI I think it's on the PBS channel on YouTube or some shit. Or you can listen to Joe Biden talk about how we're going to double our percentage of gdp spending on AI. The amount of government money that's going to go into AI as a weapon to compete with China DWARFS peoples expectations of how much large the market for the kind of software palantir makes is. 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201001005334/en/U.S.-Army-Research-Lab-Selects-Palantir-Technologies-Inc.-for-91M-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-Development

This is literally the backbone of everything AI that the government is about to invest in. Sure they're going to experiment with other research but if you do research you'll also find Palantir is the ONLY company that does anything remotely like this software that has anywhere near the kind of clearances like what is required for these contracts. They are currently a clearance level 5 and about to be the highest 6. The closest competitors are almost all a 3 or lower I'm not even sure if there's more than a single 4 and that stuff is crazy hard to get. 

But like again I'm an obsessive. I realize why people get so excited about the commercial side scaling and how it's very possible and can make them huge and it will. But I'm actually pretty sure the reason people like Cathy Wood has such a huge boner for them is that she realizes how MASSIVELY. And I mean MASSIVELY underestimated the amount of government revenue they will get from all this AI investing the United States and NATO are about to do. It's literally the next Manhattan project and they're absolutely going to be one of the biggest players developing it if not the biggest. I think it's funny because most people are pretty disinterested in the government stuff for Palantir but i really think the weaponized AI apollo stuff may be as big as anything could ever be. 




Also people got the insider selling stuff very very wrong. Tom Nash (love him or hate him I don't care) has a few really good recent videos where he explains it in basically full detail what was happening. The selling panicked a lot of retail investors during a time when the buying for growth markets had really slowed because of rate hike due to inflation scares and a ton of retail holders got scared and caused more selling and more people got scared because of that and sold and it really just was mass psychology in effect and a LOT of FUD and confusion. 

Basically a few executives karp in particular got billions of dollars worth of options that vest but literally expire so you have to exercise them which means you buy shares of the company at a strike price. Well because it's the company granting shares the strike price is literally 10 cents or something and these automatically have to vest at quarterly increments. So everytime karp was exercising he's actually buying shares. Like over 150 million in total maybe a lot more million SHARES not dollars. shares. And even those when he exercising he's buying shares technically from the company it ALL counts as profit on taxes and ITS NOT LONG TERM CAP GAINS ELIGIBLE. So over the last year plus this year he's essentially getting shares but the literal dollar value of those shares to the government counts as pure profit. So his total income which he's getting taxed at 40% of is in the BILLIONS yes billions. Because that's a lot to handle people that work for them actually automatically schedule sells of shares to cover the taxes so that there's no issue it's not even like him saying sell today and they do this.... TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INSIDER SELLING TO THE SEC. That's why it's automatically happening so no one can ever claim he's timing it. 

So listen cause here's where it gets important. The exercising of the shares counts as almost pure profits but remember he's receiving SHARES not dollars he doesn't actually get billions of dollars. So has to then sell SOME of the shares so he can pays taxes on that. Then when he sells the shares to pay the taxes for exercising he actually owes even more money if they went up from when he exercised. So everytime he's selling low its actually good for him because it's less ADDITIONAL PROFIT that he would owe taxes on.

 If he wasn't selling its because he thought it would go down even further and then he would actually owe less taxes overall. So if he thought it was going to tank he'd wait and actually get a nice fat discount on his taxes. 

I know this seems really crazy but I promise that's how it works you can look it up in detail but yeah shocking that mainstream media and redditors/youtubers who barely do research and have no real understanding of how these billion dollar compensations work would get it wrong. Unbelievable I know. If he had actually sold the massive overall percentage of his shares that some people claim he did the company would be at like $3-6 dollars not low 20s. Retail got confused because of market pressured due to interest rate fears from inflation and sold low (like retail always does) to institutions.",nmofz4,"Palantir DD if you want to understand company and it's history better (also insider ""selling"" explained in detail)"

What is Blue Apron?


Blue Apron (NYSE: APRN) was the forgotten step child, bad luck Brian, IPO of summer 2017 that priced below range and had the misfortune of debuting after Amazon bought Whole Foods. Since it‚Äôs debut, the stock has suffered dropping from nearly $150 per share (adjusted for a 2019 reverse-split necessitated to stay listed) to as low as approximately $2.00!


Why the Drop?


Management. Fucking. Sucked. The prior executive team essentially handed Chad Hello Fresh the keys to the kingdom, when they made the fatal error of betting that the ‚Äúhigh affinity core users‚Äù would be enough to sustain the business. For this reason, they cut marketing to nearly nothing and attempted to realize operating leverage by shrinking the customer base only to its most prolific buyers.

This was stupid. HelloFresh did the opposite, essentially giving away meals, and they used it to stockpile market share. Put a chart up of HelloFresh customers against Blue Apron. You‚Äôll see the two lines converge and a clear indication that HelloFresh stole most of their business. HelloFresh was one of the best trades of the past 5 years. Look at the chart, look at the sales, and look at the margins. They have managed to achieve operating leverage by employing affordable pricing and emphasizing retention.


Blue Apron Might Go Under....


Today the company is in a dire place. Languishing away in Micro Cap hell at an $80M market cap, no one on Wall Street wants to cover these guys. Only their bankers, CG and MS, write them research and neither are overly optimistic. They‚Äôre in a shit spot with a credit line that mandates they keep $15M cash at all times, and they keep their customer base above 300K (thus far, they‚Äôve struggled). They‚Äôre sitting on $29M and burn enough cash per Q that they might go below that $15M level (wouldn‚Äôt be a first). All signs are negative...


But I Think They Might Win


Blue Apron is under new management. Linda Kozlowski, is the former COO of ETSY and an ex-strategist at Alibaba. She believes HelloFresh did things right and she wants to right the ship. Her ballsy-ass plan is to ride the line on cash and go all in on customer growth. She realizes those customers are worth a lot more than income on the P&L, and that she needs to make the pot as big as she can. Thus far, it‚Äôs worked. Customers are up over 20% in the past two periods and retention rates are rising. We are seeing signs of operating leverage, and it opens a big possibility.


My Prediction

Management is buying shares. They know the company is not healthy. The only logic is that they have a plan that‚Äôs working. You can‚Äôt sell a dying business with a shrinking share, but you can certainly sell a growing community, that could be an accretive asset to a better capitalized entity. I think Linda is going either get the business in a position where it can refinance for better terms, or where it can be sold to create shareholder value via a strategic alternative.

If that happen, given this is priced for bankruptcy and ignored by the Street, the returns could easily reach the triple digits. I‚Äôm long and I plan to add on additional weakness.

Everyone is talking about how the squeeze didn't even happen and the shorts didn't cover yet. What I don't understand is why wouldn't that be possible? If short interest is 17%, so let's round up to about 100M shares. Today the volume traded was 700M shares. Couldn't 100M of those 700M have been the shorts covering? And if they didn't cover, today alone 700M shares were traded, why would 100M shares bought by shorts cause a squeeze if today 700M were traded?

I have been having this question for awhile, since I noticed the same with GME. In the days preceding January 28th (when GME reached its peak), the combined volume was several times the amount of float. How come the squeeze happened and why did it happen? If the volume was so high, couldn't the shorts have covered in the days preceding that?

I hope this makes sense and I really hope someone will be kind enough to explain a fellow retard who only knows about crayons what this all means.

1st test flight - may 
2nd crewed flight - June 
3rd flight with R Branson on board late June/July 

4th flight this will be taking the Italian airforce on a training mission (600k a seat) late July


On the run in to the first test flight some possible maintenance issues appeared with the carrier plane White knight 2‚Ä¶. 
This indeed could have gone either way , after 2 weeks inspections it was decided that WK2 did not need to delay testing no maintenance was needed at this point. Scheduled Maintenance will commence in the fall after all tests have been completed.

The plan includes creating an online ticketing platform by Great British Railways which might have a huge blow on Trainline revenue. However, this platform does not yet exist and will probably take a couple of years to develop. Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed.

In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales.  Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%.

I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time  for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

3302,,2021-05-28 10:41:01,t3_nmuzzi,,wallstreetbets,"Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent of Modernas if not more. Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects) 

Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

Imagine if the spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize one piece to understand the whole picture it and helps modify your DNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates it can still recognize the virus. In contrast to using one portion of the picture as it mutates it's easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine, that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. Not only that but they have had the least amount of side effects of any covid vaccine deeming it the safest covid vaccine.... 

And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein (whole picture) and the safety profile. Also worth a mention is that you could store it in a regular refrigerator, and let it sit out in room temperature while you're vaccinating people instead of a special ultra low temp freeze needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers, this is a majority of the world. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines so other protein competitors will be far behind and they will have an a moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing they teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine. They will be combining flu and covid vaccine by 2025 for possibly double the price of current covid vaccine.

 They are pretty much de-risked at this point. Yes you could buy other  biotechs that can go up 20x but are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up) that has all successful trials done so far, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment to where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place there are no more glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""

They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. Yesterday at market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. 
 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

Future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract in there ( in the link below in another message). It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 

I own a lot of $250 July calls along with about 1k shares. I'm all in baby. LFG I expect to turn 200k into over a million in a year's time via shares and options

Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. This is huge as the combo is going to differentiate them especially since both flu and covid vaccines are first in class.

1) We look to the PTON CFO's statement found in the latest earnings call transcript, for guidance:
""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior.""
2) Being that we do not have access to a 10-K filing for Q4 fiscal '19, we will access other filings that do in fact reference numbers from fiscal '19...
A) 10-K filing dated 9/11/2020
B) 10-Q filing dated 5/6/2020
3) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $223.3M under Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19)
But, that is TOTAL Revenue; we need to find out what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike sales...
4) To calculate what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike Sales, we can use numbers from neighboring Q3 (i.e. Three Months Ended March 31, 2019)...
A) On page 6 of the 10-Q, you will find Revenue of ""Connected Fitness Products"" (aka Bike Sales) to be $261.6M
B) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $316.7M
C) % of Bike Sales per TOTAL Revenue: $261.6M / $316.7M * 100 = 82.6% {""Connected Fitness Products"" Revenue (aka Bike Sales)}
5) Apply 82.6% to the TOTAL Revenue $223.3M for Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19): $223.3M x 0.826 = $184.45M {Bike Sales for Q4 of fiscal '19}
6) Per the CFO, ""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior."":

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote... By mid-July, we‚Äôll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase precious metals  especially silver amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative 

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

Gold rose over 60% in the 1930s as the prices of stocks and real estate crashed. You could buy an entire block with a one ounce gold coin. Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms.

I must address Cramer's statement because he is obviously trying to add fuel to the short-selling fire: When he says ""we're not going natural gas"" he is clearly making a vague and general statement meant to be interpreted in the worst possible way: ""no one is going to buy or use natural gas."" By now, I hope everyone that is interested in this stock understands that CLNE offers an alternative transportation fuel, thus, the investments made by BP and Chevron, and not revolutionary technology like some EV's (but this is mostly hype meant to catapult EVs to the front. What most people do not realize is that driverless technology and such can be placed in Petro vehicles too). Also, unfortunately, the company has done a terrible marketting job. That's why powerful analysts can get away with making vague and unsupported statements. The fact that Cramer explained the stock's decrease over the last month as being due to widespread dissaproval is misleading, at best. Many people do not yet know about the cleanliness and therapeutic effects RNG has on the climate.

The News...

If you haven't read yet it looks like Federal Cannabis legalization my be around the corner. [Here](https://www.mpp.org/policy/federal/the-more-act/) is the House Bill. Supporters seem on board and like the reforms they have done to the bill including rescheduling cannabis. [Last time](https://mjbizdaily.com/key-us-house-lawmaker-reintroduces-federal-marijuana-legalization-bill/) the bill was introduced it cleared the House.   


Personally I think this gets a lot of support especially from a fiscal point of view. With stimulus stalling and a giant debate going on about how to pay for the stimulus I think cannabis offers the easiest way to collect federal revenue. A simple review of the bill and the fiscal benefits to the Fed's can be read [here](https://www.justtherealnews.com/congress/nadler-blumenauer-lee-jackson-lee-jeffries-velazquez-reintroduce-comprehensive-marijuana-reform-legislation/). The bill states a 5% fed tax. Money coming for uncle Sam, right when questions about paying for stimulus.... Personally I think it adds up, but that's for you to decide. 

Okay so that's the hype...

Let's talk about the tickers listed ($SNDL and $TLRY). 

$SNDL

I'll start with the cheaper YOLO, $SNDL. $SNDL short interest isn't high, but the company did issue convertible notes a while back around .7c if my memory is correct. I'm not saying they won't do it again, but they should be in a good place fiscally for now. Float is high with about 1.6B shares out there. However today's volume at the time of writing is over 415M. That's not bad given such a high float. It's about 200% more than the average volume. 

The options chain on $SNDL has me giddy. With over 200,000 options currently in the money on todays move above $1 there is some high potential here for some interesting action. The put to call ratio is just obnoxiously low at .08 it's screaming upwards betting. If we hold above $1 the potential squeeze up could be amazing.   


It's also broken up on the trend lines and out of the downward channel it was in. The regression channel from the peak squeeze back in Feb just broke out today according to my crayons I have laying around. 

$TLRY

$TLRY was the squeeze of a lifetime if you remember it back in 19'. The ticker was just a money printer with it's low float and stupid hype. Then they proceeded to do, like they all do, and issue debt. Shares tumbled since then falling from $120 --> $5. Ouch bag holders.   


Like all the cannabis stocks the Feb bump pushed $TLRY to above $60 in an amazing move. $TLRY has a lower short interest than $SNDL, but it also has a much lower float at about 300M. Compared to $SNDL the volume here isn't as good, but still remains decently above the avg volume around 36M as of right now. 

If we peep the options chain we also see a crazy low P/C ratio around .11. But we don't have the Open Interest in the chain like $SNDL does unless you roll out to Jun 18. Then we finally get some decent OI.   


Personally I am going with $SNDL. The option's chain looks better, the stock is cheaper, and the short interest is a little better. My advice would be to roll out till at least the Jun 11th $1 strike to not get eaten alive by Theta and IV crush. But WSB does what WSB wants and that's why I love you all.   
Do not go above the $2 strikes IMO. You will get crushed by theta unless we get an insane move, which could happen but I don't see the risk / reward there.",nn326f,MORE ACT / CANNABIS / $SNDL & $TLRY Potential

>A corner in the silver market has been tried before - and let's be clear, that is what is being attempted now.  In 1980, a rule change by the government destroyed the corner.  #silverthursday.

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday

>Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers‚Äô attempt to corner the market on the metal.

-
>Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926‚Äì2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers‚Äô Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.

-
>By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged‚ÄîMarch 27‚Äîsilver fell to $10.80, the metal‚Äôs biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, ‚ÄúA billion dollars isn‚Äôt what it used to be,‚Äù the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.

-
>To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978‚Äì91) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities.",nn36fw,There is no silver short squeeze happening.

* Henrik Fisker is a God among men in the automotive industry - trust him to do right
* Geeta Gupta-Fisker is a solid Chief Financial Officer with experience in investment banking - she will ensure the shares are valued right
* Henrik has learned from all the mistakes he made with his previous attempt to create Fisker Automotive, and will certainly do everything in his power to avoid that mess again. He has designed systems into the intricacies of the company to avoid failure - meaning Fisker Inc is guaranteed to succeed
* Henrik Fisker on shorting $FSR - ‚ÄúYou will quickly understand that you stand to lose a lot of money if you show it against Fisker‚Äù
* Production of Fisker Ocean expected to start in November 2022
* 250,000+ units a year expected by 2025
* Partnerships with Foxconn and Magna Steyr, both giants in their respective industries, among others
* Large Fleet market in Europe gaining momentum, and 700+ Fisker reservations in this market alone
* 16,000+ reservations already. More than Tesla had 18 months pre-production
* Revenue streams include leasing automotives, servicing, selling emissions credits, selling insurance (like selling the pickaxe to miners, and selling the diamonds to the mine owners too, absolutely genius - Fisker are insuring cars which they own, because the customer is only leasing it)
* High short interest (20%+), high analyst price targets compared to current share price (100%+) and low valuation compared to peers ($3bn market cap currently)
* Designing the first ever all-electric popemobile - Massive, soon to be historic, event!
* I give $FSR (currently $13 a share) a price target of $100 by end of year 2022, if not sooner
* Price Targets: $35 by end of year - Previous ATH. $50 start of next year - European and Chinese debut of prototypes. $100 end of 2022 - start of production (SOP). $150+ 2023
* 2025 Price Targets, calculated using projected data: Bear case - $97 a share, Bull case - $519 a share
* Downside in the short term is capped by the large amount of cash on hand - one third of market cap is cash. Long term, is capped by risk factors, which are almost eligible and affect every automotive startup anyway.

Fisker was named one of the 10 Most Interesting People of 2015 by *The Drive*.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrik_Fisker#cite_note-jschultz-6) Goliath.com named him one of the 10 greatest car designers in automotive history, writing that he has created ""some of the modern masterpieces in the automobile industry.""

In 1989, Fisker began working at BMW Technik, the company's advanced design studio in Munich. His first project there was the E1 electric concept car. -  Henrik Fisker has been working on Electric cars since 1989, years before most people even knew about them.

From 1992 to 1997, he refined the Z07 concept car, which would become the BMW Z8 roadster, produced from 1999 to 2003.In 2016, at a press conference celebrating BMW's 100th anniversary, BMW CEO Harald Krueger named the Z8 as one of his three favorite BMW models in the history of the company.

In 2007, Tesla Motors hired Henrik Fisker to perform initial design work on the Tesla Model S electric sedan, which was introduced in 2012.

Fisker stated in 2018 that, with the growth of car-sharing, ride-hailing, and autonomous shuttles, he believes within 10 years private cars will be used for less than half of what they are currently used for.

## Fisker Automotive

In 2008, Fisker Automotive raised over $90 million from investors including venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. In September 2009, Fisker Automotive was awarded a $528 million loan guarantee by the United States Department of Energy (DOE). The automaker was one of four recipients of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, to encourage the domestic manufacture of electric cars. The funds were to be used to develop the Karma, as well as an affordable family-size plug-in hybrid car. The loan facility was frozen at $192 million in February 2012, after the DOE claimed that Fisker missed its milestones

In December 2011, just as the Fisker Karma was launched, its battery supplier, A123 Systems, recalled all batteries, followed by a second recall in 2012. A123 filed for bankruptcy in October 2012, leaving Fisker Automotive without a battery supplier. After selling approximately 2,000 units, production of the Fisker Karma was suspended in November 2012, in the absence of its battery supplier.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/59vfj5wa8w171.png?width=511&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1c03d1e1254fea00c195776122de2b26099dd35

Henrik Fisker resigned as chairman from Fisker Automotive in March 2013, because of disagreements with management about business strategy. Later that year, the company declared voluntary bankruptcy.Fisker raised and spent more than a billion dollars over its lifetime.The heart of Fisker‚Äôs business model was in that early deal with Quantum. The idea was to design a gorgeous car, and have suppliers like Quantum provide the technology because off-the-shelf parts from suppliers would help keep costs down.

But there were problems with this strategy: Sometimes, those parts had to be custom-made to fit the design vision, which resulted in higher prices for Fisker. Other times, parts were delivered late or, worse, faulty, but Fisker was locked in to those supplier relationships. Sources close to Fisker have also said that many of the parts were owned by the suppliers themselves, so Fisker didn‚Äôt own a lot of the internal technology.

The broker that raised funds for Fisker automotive, by selling their private shares, was Advanced Equities.It wasn‚Äôt until December 2011 and into 2012 that the more dubious efforts of Advanced Equities became clearer to Fisker‚Äôs hundreds of investors. The last few hundred million dollars of Advanced Equities‚Äô fund raising for Fisker, starting with the D-1 round, was what brokers call ‚Äúpay to play.‚Äù As Fisker was running into technical, delivery and political problems, its valuation was quickly declining. But the company still needed more money, so the brokers went back to its current investors and said: Unless you give this more, your current shares will be diluted and your preferred stock will be converted to common stock.

It was essentially a gun to their heads. This is why investor Wray sued Fisker in February 2012, alleging he was on the receiving end of this tactic. In his lawsuit, he says Advanced Equities sent him a letter dated Jan. 18, 2012, stating that he needed to decide if he wanted to invest in Fisker‚Äôs next round, and pay around $84,000 by Jan. 27, 2012 ‚Äî a little over a week from receiving the letter. He also says that Advanced Equities assured him that he would have anti-dilution protection. According to the audio clip from Advanced Equities‚Äô internal sales call in early 2010, Advanced Equity leaders say that the Fisker deal will ‚Äúsuffer no dilution,‚Äù and was ‚Äúa dream scenario.‚Äù

That dream would soon end. In September 2012 after Fisker closed on $1.2 billion in funding, the bulk of it organized by Advanced Equities, the SEC charged the broker with misleading investors when it raised money for another company back in 2009 and 2010 (Bloom Energy). Advanced settled, agreeing to pay $1 million, and its co-founders were personally fined. Two months later Advanced Equities closed up shop.

Later, A123 Systems itself went bankrupt, causing more problems for Fisker. Fisker claimed that A123 Systems owed it $140 million, but a bankruptcy settlement reduced that to a paltry $15 million.

Then there was the just plain terrible luck for the ironically named Karma: Super Storm Sandy wiped out 338 of its Karmas in storage in New Jersey. The cars first drowned, and then caught on fire ‚Äî salt water damage caused a short circuit that was spread to other cars by high winds, Fisker said at the time.

With all of this happening in public ‚Äî and in a presidential election year ‚Äî Fisker‚Äôs struggles became highly politicized. The company was mentioned numerous times in presidential debates and speeches leading up to the election. Republican nominee Romney called Fisker and other DOE-supported companies losers.

The company didn‚Äôt seem to invest substantially in technology innovation or tech IP, and seemed to spend a disproportionate amount on suppliers. For example, numerous sources have said that the company paid upfront for 15,000 of some of the parts for its planned 15,000 Karmas. It ended up only selling around 2,000 of the cars. It has also been said that Fisker paid some funds upfront to have BMW make engines for the 100,000 Nina cars it hoped to produce ‚Äî in the end, Fisker didn‚Äôt deliver a single Nina.

Costs to build each Karma also creeped up because the company missed its volume targets, and because engineering had to change designs around supplier constraints. The company ended up adding $20,000 to its initial sale price.

Expensive hires may also have sucked away chunks of Fisker‚Äôs funding: Sources say that Fisker filled the upper levels of the company with seasoned auto executives from Detroit. At the high point of Fisker, the company had around 300 employees, plus dozens of contract staff. Bringing in a certain amount of the old guard could help a car startup ramp up quickly, and also impress potential investors with ‚Äúindustry names.‚Äù But those people are also used to big auto-industry budgets that included extensive travel and salaries ‚Äî that‚Äôs the opposite life of a tech startup.

## Fisker Inc.

In July 2016, Henrik Fisker expressed interest in designing a fully connected electric car with autonomous driving features and an aesthetically pleasing look. He has pursued battery technology, and hinted at potentially reviving the Fisker name with a pure-electric vehicle using technology that nobody else has. Since then Fisker has talked about delays to the promised solid state battery technology, which he does not expect to be able to be produced in volume until at least 2025. Posing risk for competition from more scientifically experienced future solid state battery producers such as Quantumscape.

***Forbes:*** ‚ÄúNow he‚Äôs back‚Äìand three things are different. First and foremost, he has a vital new partner: his wife, cofounder and Fisker Inc. CFO Geeta Gupta-Fisker. Second, his Los Angeles-based company is public this time around, raising more than $1 billion in an October 2020 IPO. And finally, Fisker‚Äôs stock price, up 56% since its debut, has made both Henrik and Geeta billionaires, each worth about $1.1 billion as of Friday‚Äôs market close. The auto industry has seen father-son and sibling leadership teams, but Fisker Inc.‚Äôs CEO-CFO combo is the fast-changing sector‚Äôs first husband and wife power couple.‚Äù

Wealth isn‚Äôt the purpose of the new company, Henrik says. ‚ÄúI never got into cars because of money. (This shows he is willing to do what is in the best interest of the company because he is not motivated by money, unlike 99% of other CEO‚Äôs)

The couple sought a big stake in the new venture to ensure they can control its fate in a way Fisker couldn‚Äôt with his earlier company.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yzhded6pfw171.png?width=408&format=png&auto=webp&s=54b30259720cf853a8efeacf058f2f74315260b9

Henrik is an auto industry celebrity, but Geeta‚Äôs background is equally impressive. A native of India, she holds multiple degrees in science, including a Ph.D. in biotechnology from Cambridge University where she was also a Research Newton Fellow. From there, she started a career in international investment for Lloyds Banking Group, and then managed investments for a high-net-worth client for several years. (In particular, this is insanely important - Geeta **KNOWS MONEY**! She knows how best to keep a company afloat, organize its share structure, provide value to shareholders, etc. because she has worked in the industry before. She may just be the most important element of Fisker Inc., due to the financial experience she has. At every step of the way, she is likely to make decisions with one sole focus - increasing share price and value).

She met her future husband in 2011 when he was visiting London, just before things started going very wrong at Fisker Automotive. They married in 2012.

‚ÄúWhen I left Fisker Automotive, all I had was my car,‚Äù Henrik remembers. ‚ÄúI'm in a different position, mainly because of Geeta. Because she cuts the deals.‚Äù

To get the new venture off the ground, the Fiskers invested the majority of their life savings‚Äìan enormous financial risk given the fate of Henrik‚Äôs prior company. Then, just as they were locking in plans for the IPO back in July, they were hit by a highly unwelcome complication: Geeta learned she had early-stage breast cancer.

‚ÄúShe got the call (from her doctor) during a call with investors,‚Äù Henrik says. Despite that bombshell, she continued working with banks and investors in the weeks that followed, even as she underwent two surgical procedures and radiation therapy. Her medical therapy concluded in November.

Henrik, who marvels at her fortitude throughout the health crisis says, ‚Äúshe only missed something like one day of work...That's just how she is. She works tirelessly.‚Äù

## Fisker Ocean

The Fisker Ocean will have a nearly 300-mile range with an 80 kWh battery and a solar panel roof as a range extender, adding approximately 1,000 free miles of range per year. Advanced electronics will be housed under the hood, and the vehicle will incorporate recycled and sustainable materials throughout. Deliveries of the Ocean are scheduled to begin in 2022.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s87j6bdsfw171.png?width=438&format=png&auto=webp&s=e40add9ce53319d31db242cce73a303afb03cbab

Fisker has also announced a partnership with Electrify America to ensure Fisker Ocean vehicles will integrate seamlessly with Electrify America charging stations when the e-SUV hits the market. With features such as a solar roof and recycled inner materials, it will be, according to Fisker Inc., the ""world's most sustainable vehicle.""

In 2017, Fisker Inc. announced that it had filed patents on flexible solid-state battery designs. Fisker expected the batteries to be produced on a mass scale around 2020. A prototype of the battery debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018. In October 2018, Fisker announced new funding for battery development through Caterpillar Venture Capital. The solid-state batteries are intended to deliver longer vehicle range and faster charging times.

In 2018, Fisker was named to the board of directors of First Cobalt, a North American cobalt refinery that produces battery materials.

In September 2019, it was announced that Fisker Inc. was partnering with Game of Thrones actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who will serve as a partner and sustainability adviser to Fisker, to work on advanced, affordable, electric mobility models.

&#x200B;

[In addition to being a well-known actor, Coster-Waldau is also the United Nations Development Program Goodwill Ambassador for climate change and other social issues.](https://preview.redd.it/3hssff5vfw171.png?width=451&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebe55e2468c5b63d1bc0ac3c71547219dff5afaa)

Nikolaj wrote this piece about Fisker:

To quote a friend of mine who is a lot smarter than me, architect Bjarke Ingels: ‚ÄúThe idea that sustainability needs to sacrifice quality of life is a flawed one. It‚Äôs a design challenge, a challenge to build something that transforms the idea of sustainability into something that will increase the quality of life for all those around it.‚Äù

One person meeting that challenge is Henrik Fisker, who has designed some of the most iconic cars over the past decades for BMW and others, like the BMW Z8, Aston Martin DB9 and Aston Martin V8 Vantage. He‚Äôs a hero for gas-guzzling supercars. He is a fellow Dane, I am a fan, and we met, of all places, on Twitter.

When we met in person, he described his new project ‚Äî an all-electric luxury SUV ‚Äî and asked me if I would help spread the word on his car. The problem as I see it with most electric cars is that they only accomplish the basics. They get you from point A to B. They run electric so you don‚Äôt pollute while driving, but that‚Äôs it. They are basically unattractive combustion engine cars that have a battery thrown into them ‚Äî and for most of them, a battery with a limited range. What Fisker does is to try to make every part of the car in a sustainable and attractive way, like a full-length solar roof, recycled floor mats and vegan leather seats. It looks incredibly cool and inviting, with a great 250- to 300-mile range, and at a cost of just under $40,000, it‚Äôs a luxury car affordable to a mass market.

I said yes and even became an investor, not only because it‚Äôs a great car but more importantly, I hope and believe it can inspire other companies to actively incorporate sustainability goals into all aspects of their business. Fisker then had the idea of calling me ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù adviser. Which I am not. Just to be clear. Thanks Henrik, sounds cool, but I am an actor and a citizen, and that‚Äôs really it.

And what about Hollywood? Is our industry changing, are we at the forefront? Looking at social media, you would think so. And things are happening, but usually only when a camera is pointed at people. Remember a few years back when all awards shows only used EVs for the red carpet? We made a difference. We mattered. We showed the way. So cool. So green, so ‚Ä¶ brief. Now it‚Äôs back to the Escalade. But hey, we are not using plastic straws anymore!

To believe that change will come from Hollywood is not really based in reality (when did that stop us?), but we are great at reacting ‚Äî and things around us are changing, and changing us. I have a good friend who loves his SUV. It‚Äôs not electric. But he cannot give up his car. He is a good guy, he‚Äôs works for the U.N., so if he has a problem going electric, we all do. But if he is presented with an alternative that doesn‚Äôt mean a reduction in his quality of life, something like the Fisker SUV, I think he‚Äôd transition to electric in a heartbeat.

The IPO deal values Fisker Inc at US$2.9 billion, with an IPO share price of $10.

On July 30, 2020, Fisker announced plans for a four-vehicle portfolio by 2025. The Fisker Ocean SUV will be joined by a sports sedan based on their previously announced Fisker Emotion concept, a coupe-like SUV, and a lifestyle pickup truck. All will be electric vehicles.

On October 15, 2020, Fisker Inc announced it would be outsourcing vehicle production of its Fisker Ocean electric SUV to Magna Steyr, to reduce the complexities and costs related to the building and operating its own factory. Magna will start building the Fisker Ocean in Europe in 2022.

## Henrik Fisker Interview quotes:

I have people on Twitter saying, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just make the car next month? You have a prototype.‚Äù Most people don‚Äôt understand that it takes 18 months to do long-lead body tooling for high-volume vehicles. Most people don‚Äôt understand it takes two years to do durability tests and do all the engineering certification and everything else.

And on the business model itself, I believe that there is nobody in the near future or the next couple of years that‚Äôs going to make a million EVs on one model. Today, there‚Äôs nobody doing it. Tesla probably has the highest volume of one single model, a couple hundred thousand. But even the big giant established carmakers are not making, right now, a couple hundred thousand vehicles of one model. So the way you get volume, in my view, is if you partner up with other OEMs and share some of the expensive parts of the platform, which in my view is not anymore something that is unique IP or something that is a unique experience to the customer. An aluminum stamped floor or a steel stamped floor really doesn‚Äôt have any brand value anymore.

And obviously, as we move forward, we always start to do some of the things ourselves. But it was really about de-risking in our first vehicle to market. So we‚Äôre going to do another three vehicles, which we can do because we don‚Äôt have to spend all our money and effort on learning how to manufacture a car, for instance.

So we have programmed a lot. We have hired a head of ESG, environmental and social governance, and he is really spearheading developing specific... we kind of put out some goals that we would like to reach with suppliers, and we at least try to bring them in that direction. They are not reaching those goals right now, but they may reach them later. And then we have goals for ourselves. So for instance, we look at transport. Are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs closer to the plant, or are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs on the other side of the planet that way we have to then transport all that stuff. So those are the types of things that we‚Äôre really thinking about now as we‚Äôre nominating suppliers. And finally, materials as well, looking at sustainable materials. We‚Äôve actually picked up a lot of knowledge on that side as well, where we are adding more sustainable materials to our vehicle. So we are actually looking across everything ‚Äî supply chain, where the suppliers are located, what the suppliers are doing for sustainability, and also then of course in the vehicle itself ‚Äî in terms of the type of materials there.

So - let's summarize - prices are rising at their fastest pace in almost 30 years and incomes just plunged by their most ever! We're gonna need more stimmies!""  

Plus  to above; 

Last year, Hirschman Capital noted that since 1821, 98% of sovereigns that hit 130% debt/GDP have defaulted on their sovereign debt.   

The US hit 130% late last year. 

Simple Conclussion : The Fed can‚Äôt go ‚Äúhawkish‚Äù and raise rates without sending markets ‚Äìand economies‚Äìto their knees; by extension, they now have nothing left to ‚Äúcut‚Äù when the current everything bubble implodes.

And that  is a *real problem*.

 There are only two ways for sovereigns to default: 

Inflation or collapse.    

The latter is not an option. 

 As for a solution, what‚Äôs so tragic is that the only option before the Fed is an even bigger problem‚Äîcurrent and inevitably more inflation. 

 That is, if the Fed wants to keep markets (and their job security) breathing, they no longer have the foregoing template of ‚Äúrate-hike-followed-by-rate-cutting‚Äù at their disposal, which means they now have no choice but to dovishly keep rates near the zero-bound indefinitely.

But the only way to keep rates ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù and nailed to the floor of time is to purchase otherwise unwanted bonds to keep their prices elevated and hence yields and rates repressed.

Such bond ‚Äúaccommodation,‚Äù of course, costs money, and as we already know, the only ‚Äúmoney‚Äù the Fed has to spend is the kind they create out of thin air‚Äì the very kind of money (and policy) which leads to the kind of inflation discussed above‚Äînamely, the brutal kind.

 As for that fake money, the evidence of the Fed‚Äôs desperate (and only) direction is now obvious, as the following M2 money supply makes equally clear. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v774ta55sw171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e73c839beb67a67eea9aed7de4ac61d86813840

 

Fed is so embarrassed by this ‚Äúprinting solution‚Äù that they‚Äôve stopped *weekly* reporting of M2 data, and frankly, since March, have even stopped *monthly* reporting of the same.

That, of course, is both telling as well as disgraceful‚Ä¶ The Fed literally has something to hide, and that never bodes well, does it?

&#x200B;

 The correlation to central bank balance sheet (i.e., money supply) expansion and rising markets is now beyond dispute. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sgizb6xcsw171.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=aad2fe681fe0c49ac20368aba77e86c118b22959

 In short‚Äîdo you see the correlation and pattern? Do you see how the Fed‚Äôs market sausage is made? More importantly, do you now see the Fed‚Äôs self-made conundrum? 

 

Given that the Fed bows to the markets not the people, which choice do you think they‚Äôll make?

In other words, expect more money printing and more yield curve control‚Äîand hence more money creation, more inflation, and by extension more fiat currency debasement.

 More money supply to keep rates monetized simply means more currency debasement and rising inflation.",nn51ou,"""Fed's ""Favorite"" #Inflation Indicator (PCE) Explodes At Fastest Rate Since 1992 As Incomes Crash By Record"""

3342,,2021-05-28 20:45:08,t3_nn76we,,wallstreetbets,"TLDR:

I have leading indicators telling me that there are two concurrent shifts underway when it comes to who is purchasing homes.

\- Massive increase in unmarried people buying houses alone. This used to be somewhat unusual, now it's becoming very common.

\- Massive increase in unmarried men, in particular, buying houses alone. Traditionally, the female-to-male ratio of unmarried homebuyers was about 5 to 1. For the last 3 months, it's been closer to 50/50.

Source is my own closed real estate purchase transactions. Am a mortgage broker (btw this means cash purchases are ""invisible"" to me). It takes 3-6 months for [HMDA data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Mortgage_Disclosure_Act) to become accessible to journalists and academics, and thus ""visible"" to the general public (assuming journalists deem it worthy of commenting on), but I can see the trends live in real time.

How would one go about placing a bet that in about 3 or 6 months, the media, journalists, academics, etc, will pick up on this, publish articles, and potentially cause a lot of people to buy certain stocks. Which stocks would that be? Is there a ""Mancave, Inc"" out there that would potentially get an uptick? Or maybe a company making smart-home stuff that is particularly suited to renting by the room (the single men are not buying 1 bedroom condos, they are buying proper houses with 3 bedrooms, etc)?

EDIT: oh, and to be clear. It's not just an uptick in single men. It's an uptick in women too, but a massive surge from the men. It used to be that for 15 banana sales, 10 are to married couples, 4 to single women, and 1 to a single man. Now for the same 15 banana sales, it's 6 to married couples, 6 to single women, and 3 to single men, something like that.",nn76we,Homebuyer Demographics Shift towards single and male. How to bet?

NOK is making some hella moves, but granted maybe they‚Äôve catched on to us and they have call instead of puts for NOK and BB. Blackberry is higher than NOK but I think it deserves to be the other way around. 

For example, NOK just announced several agreements that allow them to expand overall networks in other countries, and if I‚Äôm understanding correctly it is contributing to expansion of infrastructure THATS HUGE. It‚Äôs undervalued - hella undervalued.

3615,gzt061h,2021-05-28 21:22:39,t1_gzt061h,t1_gzsdxy0,wallstreetbets,"The theory is roughly accurate, the big point is that the premium will most definitely be higher than that if you‚Äôre buying in-the-money calls, so you could (and if it‚Äôs a stock with any show of growth, probably would) be paying a $5 premium for that call, so you‚Äôd be barely at the breakeven point.

The other point of issue that comes into play with options is that you need to have capital to exercise the options, so if you‚Äôre exercising your $10 call you‚Äôll need $1000 available to pay for the shares.  It‚Äôs generally not doable to exercise and simply try to turn around and sell the shares to recover the costs to pay for them, it starts breaking liquidation rules.

So what you may do instead is see what those calls are selling for.  Let‚Äôs say, people are paying $5 for the premium over your $.50 initial premium.  You can just sell the option to one of them for a x10 return on your $50, so $500.

You don‚Äôt need to have cash to exercise with in this case, and the returns are a lot better than what you‚Äôd have made exercising the stocks.  So if you were to buy $1000 of shares, or $1000 of options, you‚Äôd have a higher potential return from the options.  They can also crash and expire worthless, which means you‚Äôre out the $1000, whereas shares probably will still have value.",,

That is because inflation is measured by looking at the prices and not by the money supply. Inflation is not the money supply. I have studied economics. There is a type of inflation, demand-pull inflation, that is caused by an increase in demand relative to the supply, resulting in higher prices (again high prices is how inflation is measured, not by money supply). This demand could come from an increase money supply, but an increase in the money supply does not cause inflation. Inflation is not the money supply. Money supply increasing is not inflation. 

Traditional Fee said that money printed doesn't equal inflation and that is true. The rest of what he said, I'm not sure because I agree with your sentiment that CPI is cooked.

But if you did that then you would know that AAPL has had 10 PTs this month and they are 40% to 80% higher than this one (i did not do actual math) .

""**As a currency loses value, prices rise** and it buys fewer goods and services. This loss of purchasing power impacts the general cost of living for the common public which ultimately leads to a deceleration in economic growth. The consensus view among economists is that sustained **inflation occurs when a nation's money supply growth outpaces economic growth**.""

This is what I was conveying earlier about increasing the money supply to match productivity gains (to achieve price stability). As a society, we try to measure inflation by looking at prices, which is a symptom of inflation. But they are not equal. CPI is consumer price index, not consumer inflation index. There are millions of products and services which have prices, which can vary over time and space, whereas the money supply is a single concept (the supply is inflated or deflated by a central authority which issues and/or destroys said currency, in the case of our fiat system).

One of the reasons our recent (20+ years) of inflation has resulted in only ""gradual"" price increases (if we think of +10% annualized increases to healthcare, tuition costs, etc. as ""gradual"") is because most of the newly created money is concentrated in the very top 0.1% of society, and much of it is exported to other nations which use the USD to settle international trade. Hence, the things consumed only by the super wealthy (which are also very scarce or difficult to produce, such as real estate in very exclusive areas, super yachts, certain artwork, etc.) have actually increased in price dramatically. That's where a lot of actual inflation really shows up (the prices of those things consumed by the people with the vast majority of newly minted money increase in price first).

Check out the ""Cantillon"" effect, it's very fascinating. Eventually, the newly created money finds its way into the broader society and permanently elevates prices of things consumed by the common people, too",,

[When we last left our hero,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrly28/the_legend_of_utheemperorofjenks_aka_ornamental/) he had just lost all of his rent money and what he could advance from credit cards on a failed Super Bowl bet, and a YOLO on ‚ÄúRhodium‚Äù that he ordered from a sketchy Slovakian Wish.com ripoff. Alas, it was, of course, fake, and he was broke and depressed. It might have been the first fatal case of autism. He thought to himself ‚ÄúAm I really that retarded?‚Äù Then, he realized ‚ÄúNo, it must be Oklahoma that‚Äôs retarded!‚Äù

So, [after a brief case of violent diarrhea from Oklahoma Grocery Store sushi](https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/lrslbb/psa_do_not_eat_grocery_store_sushi_right_now/), he was ready to hatch his plan! Uruguay! Yes, Uruguay. [He was going to move to Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lh5igx/c%C3%B3mo_se_puede_llegar_a_melo_desde_montevideo_sin/)

His plans for this move could‚Äôve been anyone‚Äôs guess. One possibility he inquired about was [how to be a Tea Blendmaster.](https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/lfga0m/how_does_one_become_a_blendmaster/) [Another was him possibly reconnecting with God.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/lsij6j/agnostic_jew_seeking_faith_in_god/) Yet, he seemed to be asking questions about another topic more often than the others...

[Bees.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lxcnt1/c%C3%B3mo_es_la_legalidad_de_la_apicultura_informal/)

Specifically, beekeeping, a topic he admitted he had no experience in, [as evident from him looking for any book on the subject as an introduction months before.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/)

What he planned on doing with the bees was anyone‚Äôs guess, and I doubt he thought it through that much either. One post **AFTER** he took possession of 200,000 bees (we‚Äôll get to that later,) was [asking Americans if there was a demand for mead in the states.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/) So, was he thinking of importing Uruguayan honey to the US to be made into mead? Was he going to make it himself? Did he move to another continent for no reason? Let‚Äôs all find out!

A little more than 2 months ago, he finally did it. [He moved to Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/m9ejpn/la_paloma/) And about a week after that, [he was driving a truck filled with 200k bees across his new country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/) Based on replies in that thread, he was aiming to have [a monopoly on beekeeping in the country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/gt48gke/)

[He picked up his hives without complication.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mtkkf3/about_to_upsize_my_apiary_whats_the_best_layout/) [And then he settled into Melo, Uruguay, and set up his apiary ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/n1jnte/my_humble_apiary_near_melo_uruguay/). Life was good.

But, trouble was afoot. According to a reply, [the species he was planning on keeping had literally never been kept by keepers in Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mtkkf3/about_to_upsize_my_apiary_whats_the_best_layout/gv0viej/) And then, disaster struck. [He went to TIFU to post his tale of spreading an invasive species in an industry he knew nothing about.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/nmd69k/tifu_by_importing_bees_to_uruguay/)

Indeed, he had no idea even what a bee was until he stumbled his way through a book, and then decided to YOLO into honey in Uruguay. He somehow got in touch with an ecology professor in Montevideo that would help him set things up in exchange for grad students fucking with them every now and again. Oh, and the bees were from fucking Myanmar. Handshake agreement, of course. Total Chad move.

And like I said before, the rest went without incident for a while. It would take the bees ‚Äúa year‚Äù to make honey, so he just kinda hung out, stayed busy, and tried to find part time work in a foreign country he arrived in 2.5 months earlier.

And then, the professor ghosted him. Just disappeared. Shortly thereafter, government agents come out about this kid from Oklahoma illegally importing a non-native bee to their country. Apparently his bees had been fucking with other apiaries. So, he did probably the smartest thing he‚Äôs ever done.

He ran.

He fucking ran from the Uruguayan government, took a plane to LAX, and arrived with $14 to his name. His friend sent him $100, which wasn‚Äôt enough to go back to Oklahoma, so he took a $75 flight to Seattle, where he is also not from.

His last post is from a train out of the airport, with $39 to his name. I don‚Äôt know what is in store for him, but I know that $39 is as good as spent on urchin futures or whatever market he‚Äôs going to crash up there.

4733,,2021-05-28 03:12:37,t3_nmofz4,,wallstreetbets,"This started as a comment reply but I thought maybe people would like reading it. I've been researching Palantir since literally late November 2020 and I have nearly my entire portfolio in LEAPS expiring January 2023. So I have continually done more research on them this is just the basics to clear up confusion and help people who don't understand it because it's hard to hear all the hype and stuff. Also AMC to the moon tomorrow for my FDs I bought!! Don't judge me it's just fun to be in on the action on weeks like this.


So you should think of palantir as basically three companies and they actually are very far from unprofitable. 

They developed the really massive government software (gotham) specifically as a result of an interaction that happened to Peter Thiel while he was at paypal. They were losing millions to foreign scammers at paypal and the solution ended up being a high quality algorithm that flagged the most likely scam transactions and then allowed analysts to efficiently double check and verify the real scam transactions.

 It essentially was using what computers are efficient at (sorting through massive amounts of data) and then combining that with what humans are good at (looking at the more complex nuances that at least at that point computer algorithms were incapable of doing) and augmenting the humans ability to make complex decisions by rapidly sorting through the incoming data and bringing everything good to their attention.

They fixed paypals using this method and literally made the company profitable overnight because of fixing how much they were losing in the scam transactions. The FBI contacted PayPal and Thiel about using that initial software. That was literally his inspiration for what would become Palantir. He goes over it in huge detail in his book zero to one. If you make an audible account you can read it for free and find the chapter I'm talking about.

Then for 15 years they perfected the government software into the absolute nearly monopoly it is now in government intelligence augmentation software. The whole time though they reinvested almost everything for the last 10 years into building the commercial software (Foundry). That side of the business has only been live for a VERY short time and initially they literally didn't spend a single dollar on marketing their first commercial clients sought THEM out because of their insane reputation with the government. Foundry helps with supply chains and all kinds of other important data  insights. But if you want a recent example the NIH and the NHS both used Foundry to figure out how to best distribute the vaccine and vaccine distribution in the US and Britain has far outpaced expectations. You think commercial companies aren't going to be interested in using the software that was literally proven on a level like that?

 They're only just now adding huge amounts of people to their sales teams literally in the last six months which if you read Peter thiels book is insane for the stock because they have this crazy long term plan and he literally talks about how when they get to a certain point and start adding sales as a full sector of the company it means that is the company the company plans to BEGIN scaling. Meaning they're this big and they literally only just started on the scaling part. Which they've also said in tons of interviews if you're a die hard Palantirian like me. 



They actually also have the third side of the  business which is their actual like full AI for weaponization and war and defense for the government. Gotham is like helping analysts and commanders lead and even helping police or agents figure out what's going on. This other software is different. It's called Apollo and its only at the beginning too. It's like pure AI machine learning AI handles everything stuff. Go find a video called pentagon head of NSC briefs public on AI I think it's on the PBS channel on YouTube or some shit. Or you can listen to Joe Biden talk about how we're going to double our percentage of gdp spending on AI. The amount of government money that's going to go into AI as a weapon to compete with China DWARFS peoples expectations of how much large the market for the kind of software palantir makes is. 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201001005334/en/U.S.-Army-Research-Lab-Selects-Palantir-Technologies-Inc.-for-91M-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-Development

This is literally the backbone of everything AI that the government is about to invest in. Sure they're going to experiment with other research but if you do research you'll also find Palantir is the ONLY company that does anything remotely like this software that has anywhere near the kind of clearances like what is required for these contracts. They are currently a clearance level 5 and about to be the highest 6. The closest competitors are almost all a 3 or lower I'm not even sure if there's more than a single 4 and that stuff is crazy hard to get. 

But like again I'm an obsessive. I realize why people get so excited about the commercial side scaling and how it's very possible and can make them huge and it will. But I'm actually pretty sure the reason people like Cathy Wood has such a huge boner for them is that she realizes how MASSIVELY. And I mean MASSIVELY underestimated the amount of government revenue they will get from all this AI investing the United States and NATO are about to do. It's literally the next Manhattan project and they're absolutely going to be one of the biggest players developing it if not the biggest. I think it's funny because most people are pretty disinterested in the government stuff for Palantir but i really think the weaponized AI apollo stuff may be as big as anything could ever be. 




Also people got the insider selling stuff very very wrong. Tom Nash (love him or hate him I don't care) has a few really good recent videos where he explains it in basically full detail what was happening. The selling panicked a lot of retail investors during a time when the buying for growth markets had really slowed because of rate hike due to inflation scares and a ton of retail holders got scared and caused more selling and more people got scared because of that and sold and it really just was mass psychology in effect and a LOT of FUD and confusion. 

Basically a few executives karp in particular got billions of dollars worth of options that vest but literally expire so you have to exercise them which means you buy shares of the company at a strike price. Well because it's the company granting shares the strike price is literally 10 cents or something and these automatically have to vest at quarterly increments. So everytime karp was exercising he's actually buying shares. Like over 150 million in total maybe a lot more million SHARES not dollars. shares. And even those when he exercising he's buying shares technically from the company it ALL counts as profit on taxes and ITS NOT LONG TERM CAP GAINS ELIGIBLE. So over the last year plus this year he's essentially getting shares but the literal dollar value of those shares to the government counts as pure profit. So his total income which he's getting taxed at 40% of is in the BILLIONS yes billions. Because that's a lot to handle people that work for them actually automatically schedule sells of shares to cover the taxes so that there's no issue it's not even like him saying sell today and they do this.... TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INSIDER SELLING TO THE SEC. That's why it's automatically happening so no one can ever claim he's timing it. 

So listen cause here's where it gets important. The exercising of the shares counts as almost pure profits but remember he's receiving SHARES not dollars he doesn't actually get billions of dollars. So has to then sell SOME of the shares so he can pays taxes on that. Then when he sells the shares to pay the taxes for exercising he actually owes even more money if they went up from when he exercised. So everytime he's selling low its actually good for him because it's less ADDITIONAL PROFIT that he would owe taxes on.

 If he wasn't selling its because he thought it would go down even further and then he would actually owe less taxes overall. So if he thought it was going to tank he'd wait and actually get a nice fat discount on his taxes. 

I know this seems really crazy but I promise that's how it works you can look it up in detail but yeah shocking that mainstream media and redditors/youtubers who barely do research and have no real understanding of how these billion dollar compensations work would get it wrong. Unbelievable I know. If he had actually sold the massive overall percentage of his shares that some people claim he did the company would be at like $3-6 dollars not low 20s. Retail got confused because of market pressured due to interest rate fears from inflation and sold low (like retail always does) to institutions.",nmofz4,"Palantir DD if you want to understand company and it's history better (also insider ""selling"" explained in detail)"

What is Blue Apron?


Blue Apron (NYSE: APRN) was the forgotten step child, bad luck Brian, IPO of summer 2017 that priced below range and had the misfortune of debuting after Amazon bought Whole Foods. Since it‚Äôs debut, the stock has suffered dropping from nearly $150 per share (adjusted for a 2019 reverse-split necessitated to stay listed) to as low as approximately $2.00!


Why the Drop?


Management. Fucking. Sucked. The prior executive team essentially handed Chad Hello Fresh the keys to the kingdom, when they made the fatal error of betting that the ‚Äúhigh affinity core users‚Äù would be enough to sustain the business. For this reason, they cut marketing to nearly nothing and attempted to realize operating leverage by shrinking the customer base only to its most prolific buyers.

This was stupid. HelloFresh did the opposite, essentially giving away meals, and they used it to stockpile market share. Put a chart up of HelloFresh customers against Blue Apron. You‚Äôll see the two lines converge and a clear indication that HelloFresh stole most of their business. HelloFresh was one of the best trades of the past 5 years. Look at the chart, look at the sales, and look at the margins. They have managed to achieve operating leverage by employing affordable pricing and emphasizing retention.


Blue Apron Might Go Under....


Today the company is in a dire place. Languishing away in Micro Cap hell at an $80M market cap, no one on Wall Street wants to cover these guys. Only their bankers, CG and MS, write them research and neither are overly optimistic. They‚Äôre in a shit spot with a credit line that mandates they keep $15M cash at all times, and they keep their customer base above 300K (thus far, they‚Äôve struggled). They‚Äôre sitting on $29M and burn enough cash per Q that they might go below that $15M level (wouldn‚Äôt be a first). All signs are negative...


But I Think They Might Win


Blue Apron is under new management. Linda Kozlowski, is the former COO of ETSY and an ex-strategist at Alibaba. She believes HelloFresh did things right and she wants to right the ship. Her ballsy-ass plan is to ride the line on cash and go all in on customer growth. She realizes those customers are worth a lot more than income on the P&L, and that she needs to make the pot as big as she can. Thus far, it‚Äôs worked. Customers are up over 20% in the past two periods and retention rates are rising. We are seeing signs of operating leverage, and it opens a big possibility.


My Prediction

Management is buying shares. They know the company is not healthy. The only logic is that they have a plan that‚Äôs working. You can‚Äôt sell a dying business with a shrinking share, but you can certainly sell a growing community, that could be an accretive asset to a better capitalized entity. I think Linda is going either get the business in a position where it can refinance for better terms, or where it can be sold to create shareholder value via a strategic alternative.

If that happen, given this is priced for bankruptcy and ignored by the Street, the returns could easily reach the triple digits. I‚Äôm long and I plan to add on additional weakness.

Everyone is talking about how the squeeze didn't even happen and the shorts didn't cover yet. What I don't understand is why wouldn't that be possible? If short interest is 17%, so let's round up to about 100M shares. Today the volume traded was 700M shares. Couldn't 100M of those 700M have been the shorts covering? And if they didn't cover, today alone 700M shares were traded, why would 100M shares bought by shorts cause a squeeze if today 700M were traded?

I have been having this question for awhile, since I noticed the same with GME. In the days preceding January 28th (when GME reached its peak), the combined volume was several times the amount of float. How come the squeeze happened and why did it happen? If the volume was so high, couldn't the shorts have covered in the days preceding that?

4756,,2021-05-28 09:17:32,t3_nmtt43,,wallstreetbets,"Trainline has taken a huge dip since the UK government's announcement of the plan to nationalise the railway network. The plan includes creating an online ticketing platform by Great British Railways which might have a huge blow on Trainline revenue. However, this platform does not yet exist and will probably take a couple of years to develop. Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed.

In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales.  Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%.

I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time  for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

This is my first time making a post here, please do give constructive feedback and criticism.

4761,,2021-05-28 10:41:01,t3_nmuzzi,,wallstreetbets,"Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent of Modernas if not more. Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects) 

Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

Imagine if the spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize one piece to understand the whole picture it and helps modify your DNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates it can still recognize the virus. In contrast to using one portion of the picture as it mutates it's easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine, that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. Not only that but they have had the least amount of side effects of any covid vaccine deeming it the safest covid vaccine.... 

And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein (whole picture) and the safety profile. Also worth a mention is that you could store it in a regular refrigerator, and let it sit out in room temperature while you're vaccinating people instead of a special ultra low temp freeze needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers, this is a majority of the world. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines so other protein competitors will be far behind and they will have an a moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing they teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine. They will be combining flu and covid vaccine by 2025 for possibly double the price of current covid vaccine.

 They are pretty much de-risked at this point. Yes you could buy other  biotechs that can go up 20x but are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up) that has all successful trials done so far, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment to where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place there are no more glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""

They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. Yesterday at market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. 
 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

Future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract in there ( in the link below in another message). It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 

I own some $200 July calls along with about 933 shares. I'm all in baby.  Been in since $3.84! LFG I expect to turn that into over a cool million in a year's time via shares and options

Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. This is huge as the combo is going to differentiate them especially since both flu and covid vaccines are first in class.

Note from SG: ""For todays expiration our models show about 15% SPX /30% SPY gamma expiring, which could allow volatility increase a bit into next week. This in turn may free markets for a push up into that 4250 target (Call Wall) area.""

Gamma Index: decreased to -0.1 (A large negative figure indicates volatility may be high. The range is from 4 to ‚Äì4.)

Vol Trigger: Increased to 419 (Important support and resistance level. (above this level = lower volatility and a more stable stock price.)

Abs Gamma Strike: Unchanged

Gamma Notional: Decreased to $-516 (stock has larger put gamma position. A negative gamma position implies higher volatility in the underlying)

Put Wall Support: Increased to 419 (If Put Wall shifts to a higher strike it could be a bearish indication)

Call Wall Strike: Increased to 425 (When this strike is rolled higher it is generally considered bullish)

Gamma Tilt: Decreased to 0.88	 (when decreasing it‚Äôs a bearish signal.)

Net Delta: Increased to 198k (positive delta position infers options market makers have a net long hedge.)

25d risk reversal: Increased to -0.06 (When the ratio shifts towards 0 it indicates call demand)

""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior.""
2) Being that we do not have access to a 10-K filing for Q4 fiscal '19, we will access other filings that do in fact reference numbers from fiscal '19...

3) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $223.3M under Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19)
But, that is TOTAL Revenue; we need to find out what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike sales...
4) To calculate what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike Sales, we can use numbers from neighboring Q3 (i.e. Three Months Ended March 31, 2019)...
A) On page 6 of the 10-Q, you will find Revenue of ""Connected Fitness Products"" (aka Bike Sales) to be $261.6M
B) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $316.7M
C) % of Bike Sales per TOTAL Revenue: $261.6M / $316.7M * 100 = 82.6% {""Connected Fitness Products"" Revenue (aka Bike Sales)}
5) Apply 82.6% to the TOTAL Revenue $223.3M for Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19): $223.3M x 0.826 = $184.45M {Bike Sales for Q4 of fiscal '19}

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote... By mid-July, we‚Äôll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase precious metals  especially silver amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative 

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

Gold rose over 60% in the 1930s as the prices of stocks and real estate crashed. You could buy an entire block with a one ounce gold coin. Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms.

I must address Cramer's statement because he is obviously trying to add fuel to the short-selling fire: When he says ""we're not going natural gas"" he is clearly making a vague and general statement meant to be interpreted in the worst possible way: ""no one is going to buy or use natural gas."" By now, I hope everyone that is interested in this stock understands that CLNE offers an alternative transportation fuel, thus, the investments made by BP and Chevron, and not revolutionary technology like some EV's (but this is mostly hype meant to catapult EVs to the front. What most people do not realize is that driverless technology and such can be placed in Petro vehicles too). Also, unfortunately, the company has done a terrible marketting job. That's why powerful analysts can get away with making vague and unsupported statements. The fact that Cramer explained the stock's decrease over the last month as being due to widespread dissaproval is misleading, at best. Many people do not yet know about the cleanliness and therapeutic effects RNG has on the climate.

EDIT 2: Probably HFT and Limit Orders being hit once the price reached 420, I could see that.

The News...

If you haven't read yet it looks like Federal Cannabis legalization my be around the corner. [Here](https://www.mpp.org/policy/federal/the-more-act/) is the House Bill. Supporters seem on board and like the reforms they have done to the bill including rescheduling cannabis. [Last time](https://mjbizdaily.com/key-us-house-lawmaker-reintroduces-federal-marijuana-legalization-bill/) the bill was introduced it cleared the House.   


Personally I think this gets a lot of support especially from a fiscal point of view. With stimulus stalling and a giant debate going on about how to pay for the stimulus I think cannabis offers the easiest way to collect federal revenue. A simple review of the bill and the fiscal benefits to the Fed's can be read [here](https://www.justtherealnews.com/congress/nadler-blumenauer-lee-jackson-lee-jeffries-velazquez-reintroduce-comprehensive-marijuana-reform-legislation/). The bill states a 5% fed tax. Money coming for uncle Sam, right when questions about paying for stimulus.... Personally I think it adds up, but that's for you to decide. 

Okay so that's the hype...

Let's talk about the tickers listed ($SNDL and $TLRY). 

$SNDL

I'll start with the cheaper YOLO, $SNDL. $SNDL short interest isn't high, but the company did issue convertible notes a while back around .7c if my memory is correct. I'm not saying they won't do it again, but they should be in a good place fiscally for now. Float is high with about 1.6B shares out there. However today's volume at the time of writing is over 415M. That's not bad given such a high float. It's about 200% more than the average volume. 

The options chain on $SNDL has me giddy. With over 200,000 options currently in the money on todays move above $1 there is some high potential here for some interesting action. The put to call ratio is just obnoxiously low at .08 it's screaming upwards betting. If we hold above $1 the potential squeeze up could be amazing.   


It's also broken up on the trend lines and out of the downward channel it was in. The regression channel from the peak squeeze back in Feb just broke out today according to my crayons I have laying around. 

$TLRY

$TLRY was the squeeze of a lifetime if you remember it back in 19'. The ticker was just a money printer with it's low float and stupid hype. Then they proceeded to do, like they all do, and issue debt. Shares tumbled since then falling from $120 --> $5. Ouch bag holders.   


Like all the cannabis stocks the Feb bump pushed $TLRY to above $60 in an amazing move. $TLRY has a lower short interest than $SNDL, but it also has a much lower float at about 300M. Compared to $SNDL the volume here isn't as good, but still remains decently above the avg volume around 36M as of right now. 

If we peep the options chain we also see a crazy low P/C ratio around .11. But we don't have the Open Interest in the chain like $SNDL does unless you roll out to Jun 18. Then we finally get some decent OI.   


Personally I am going with $SNDL. The option's chain looks better, the stock is cheaper, and the short interest is a little better. My advice would be to roll out till at least the Jun 11th $1 strike to not get eaten alive by Theta and IV crush. But WSB does what WSB wants and that's why I love you all.   
Do not go above the $2 strikes IMO. You will get crushed by theta unless we get an insane move, which could happen but I don't see the risk / reward there.",nn326f,MORE ACT / CANNABIS / $SNDL & $TLRY Potential

>A corner in the silver market has been tried before - and let's be clear, that is what is being attempted now.  In 1980, a rule change by the government destroyed the corner.  #silverthursday.

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday

>Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers‚Äô attempt to corner the market on the metal.

-
>Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926‚Äì2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers‚Äô Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.

-
>By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged‚ÄîMarch 27‚Äîsilver fell to $10.80, the metal‚Äôs biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, ‚ÄúA billion dollars isn‚Äôt what it used to be,‚Äù the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.

-
>To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978‚Äì91) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities.",nn36fw,There is no silver short squeeze happening.

* Henrik Fisker is a God among men in the automotive industry - trust him to do right
* Geeta Gupta-Fisker is a solid Chief Financial Officer with experience in investment banking - she will ensure the shares are valued right
* Henrik has learned from all the mistakes he made with his previous attempt to create Fisker Automotive, and will certainly do everything in his power to avoid that mess again. He has designed systems into the intricacies of the company to avoid failure - meaning Fisker Inc is guaranteed to succeed
* Henrik Fisker on shorting $FSR - ‚ÄúYou will quickly understand that you stand to lose a lot of money if you show it against Fisker‚Äù
* Production of Fisker Ocean expected to start in November 2022
* 250,000+ units a year expected by 2025
* Partnerships with Foxconn and Magna Steyr, both giants in their respective industries, among others
* Large Fleet market in Europe gaining momentum, and 700+ Fisker reservations in this market alone
* 16,000+ reservations already. More than Tesla had 18 months pre-production
* Revenue streams include leasing automotives, servicing, selling emissions credits, selling insurance (like selling the pickaxe to miners, and selling the diamonds to the mine owners too, absolutely genius - Fisker are insuring cars which they own, because the customer is only leasing it)
* High short interest (20%+), high analyst price targets compared to current share price (100%+) and low valuation compared to peers ($3bn market cap currently)
* Designing the first ever all-electric popemobile - Massive, soon to be historic, event!
* I give $FSR (currently $13 a share) a price target of $100 by end of year 2022, if not sooner
* Price Targets: $35 by end of year - Previous ATH. $50 start of next year - European and Chinese debut of prototypes. $100 end of 2022 - start of production (SOP). $150+ 2023
* 2025 Price Targets, calculated using projected data: Bear case - $97 a share, Bull case - $519 a share
* Downside in the short term is capped by the large amount of cash on hand - one third of market cap is cash. Long term, is capped by risk factors, which are almost eligible and affect every automotive startup anyway.

## Fisker Automotive

In 2008, Fisker Automotive raised over $90 million from investors including venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. In September 2009, Fisker Automotive was awarded a $528 million loan guarantee by the United States Department of Energy (DOE). The automaker was one of four recipients of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, to encourage the domestic manufacture of electric cars. The funds were to be used to develop the Karma, as well as an affordable family-size plug-in hybrid car. The loan facility was frozen at $192 million in February 2012, after the DOE claimed that Fisker missed its milestones

In December 2011, just as the Fisker Karma was launched, its battery supplier, A123 Systems, recalled all batteries, followed by a second recall in 2012. A123 filed for bankruptcy in October 2012, leaving Fisker Automotive without a battery supplier. After selling approximately 2,000 units, production of the Fisker Karma was suspended in November 2012, in the absence of its battery supplier.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/59vfj5wa8w171.png?width=511&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1c03d1e1254fea00c195776122de2b26099dd35

Henrik Fisker resigned as chairman from Fisker Automotive in March 2013, because of disagreements with management about business strategy. Later that year, the company declared voluntary bankruptcy.Fisker raised and spent more than a billion dollars over its lifetime.The heart of Fisker‚Äôs business model was in that early deal with Quantum. The idea was to design a gorgeous car, and have suppliers like Quantum provide the technology because off-the-shelf parts from suppliers would help keep costs down.

But there were problems with this strategy: Sometimes, those parts had to be custom-made to fit the design vision, which resulted in higher prices for Fisker. Other times, parts were delivered late or, worse, faulty, but Fisker was locked in to those supplier relationships. Sources close to Fisker have also said that many of the parts were owned by the suppliers themselves, so Fisker didn‚Äôt own a lot of the internal technology.

The broker that raised funds for Fisker automotive, by selling their private shares, was Advanced Equities.It wasn‚Äôt until December 2011 and into 2012 that the more dubious efforts of Advanced Equities became clearer to Fisker‚Äôs hundreds of investors. The last few hundred million dollars of Advanced Equities‚Äô fund raising for Fisker, starting with the D-1 round, was what brokers call ‚Äúpay to play.‚Äù As Fisker was running into technical, delivery and political problems, its valuation was quickly declining. But the company still needed more money, so the brokers went back to its current investors and said: Unless you give this more, your current shares will be diluted and your preferred stock will be converted to common stock.

It was essentially a gun to their heads. This is why investor Wray sued Fisker in February 2012, alleging he was on the receiving end of this tactic. In his lawsuit, he says Advanced Equities sent him a letter dated Jan. 18, 2012, stating that he needed to decide if he wanted to invest in Fisker‚Äôs next round, and pay around $84,000 by Jan. 27, 2012 ‚Äî a little over a week from receiving the letter. He also says that Advanced Equities assured him that he would have anti-dilution protection. According to the audio clip from Advanced Equities‚Äô internal sales call in early 2010, Advanced Equity leaders say that the Fisker deal will ‚Äúsuffer no dilution,‚Äù and was ‚Äúa dream scenario.‚Äù

That dream would soon end. In September 2012 after Fisker closed on $1.2 billion in funding, the bulk of it organized by Advanced Equities, the SEC charged the broker with misleading investors when it raised money for another company back in 2009 and 2010 (Bloom Energy). Advanced settled, agreeing to pay $1 million, and its co-founders were personally fined. Two months later Advanced Equities closed up shop.

Later, A123 Systems itself went bankrupt, causing more problems for Fisker. Fisker claimed that A123 Systems owed it $140 million, but a bankruptcy settlement reduced that to a paltry $15 million.

Then there was the just plain terrible luck for the ironically named Karma: Super Storm Sandy wiped out 338 of its Karmas in storage in New Jersey. The cars first drowned, and then caught on fire ‚Äî salt water damage caused a short circuit that was spread to other cars by high winds, Fisker said at the time.

With all of this happening in public ‚Äî and in a presidential election year ‚Äî Fisker‚Äôs struggles became highly politicized. The company was mentioned numerous times in presidential debates and speeches leading up to the election. Republican nominee Romney called Fisker and other DOE-supported companies losers.

The company didn‚Äôt seem to invest substantially in technology innovation or tech IP, and seemed to spend a disproportionate amount on suppliers. For example, numerous sources have said that the company paid upfront for 15,000 of some of the parts for its planned 15,000 Karmas. It ended up only selling around 2,000 of the cars. It has also been said that Fisker paid some funds upfront to have BMW make engines for the 100,000 Nina cars it hoped to produce ‚Äî in the end, Fisker didn‚Äôt deliver a single Nina.

Costs to build each Karma also creeped up because the company missed its volume targets, and because engineering had to change designs around supplier constraints. The company ended up adding $20,000 to its initial sale price.

Expensive hires may also have sucked away chunks of Fisker‚Äôs funding: Sources say that Fisker filled the upper levels of the company with seasoned auto executives from Detroit. At the high point of Fisker, the company had around 300 employees, plus dozens of contract staff. Bringing in a certain amount of the old guard could help a car startup ramp up quickly, and also impress potential investors with ‚Äúindustry names.‚Äù But those people are also used to big auto-industry budgets that included extensive travel and salaries ‚Äî that‚Äôs the opposite life of a tech startup.

## Fisker Inc.

In July 2016, Henrik Fisker expressed interest in designing a fully connected electric car with autonomous driving features and an aesthetically pleasing look. He has pursued battery technology, and hinted at potentially reviving the Fisker name with a pure-electric vehicle using technology that nobody else has. Since then Fisker has talked about delays to the promised solid state battery technology, which he does not expect to be able to be produced in volume until at least 2025. Posing risk for competition from more scientifically experienced future solid state battery producers such as Quantumscape.

***Forbes:*** ‚ÄúNow he‚Äôs back‚Äìand three things are different. First and foremost, he has a vital new partner: his wife, cofounder and Fisker Inc. CFO Geeta Gupta-Fisker. Second, his Los Angeles-based company is public this time around, raising more than $1 billion in an October 2020 IPO. And finally, Fisker‚Äôs stock price, up 56% since its debut, has made both Henrik and Geeta billionaires, each worth about $1.1 billion as of Friday‚Äôs market close. The auto industry has seen father-son and sibling leadership teams, but Fisker Inc.‚Äôs CEO-CFO combo is the fast-changing sector‚Äôs first husband and wife power couple.‚Äù

Wealth isn‚Äôt the purpose of the new company, Henrik says. ‚ÄúI never got into cars because of money. (This shows he is willing to do what is in the best interest of the company because he is not motivated by money, unlike 99% of other CEO‚Äôs)

The couple sought a big stake in the new venture to ensure they can control its fate in a way Fisker couldn‚Äôt with his earlier company.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yzhded6pfw171.png?width=408&format=png&auto=webp&s=54b30259720cf853a8efeacf058f2f74315260b9

Henrik is an auto industry celebrity, but Geeta‚Äôs background is equally impressive. A native of India, she holds multiple degrees in science, including a Ph.D. in biotechnology from Cambridge University where she was also a Research Newton Fellow. From there, she started a career in international investment for Lloyds Banking Group, and then managed investments for a high-net-worth client for several years. (In particular, this is insanely important - Geeta **KNOWS MONEY**! She knows how best to keep a company afloat, organize its share structure, provide value to shareholders, etc. because she has worked in the industry before. She may just be the most important element of Fisker Inc., due to the financial experience she has. At every step of the way, she is likely to make decisions with one sole focus - increasing share price and value).

She met her future husband in 2011 when he was visiting London, just before things started going very wrong at Fisker Automotive. They married in 2012.

‚ÄúWhen I left Fisker Automotive, all I had was my car,‚Äù Henrik remembers. ‚ÄúI'm in a different position, mainly because of Geeta. Because she cuts the deals.‚Äù

To get the new venture off the ground, the Fiskers invested the majority of their life savings‚Äìan enormous financial risk given the fate of Henrik‚Äôs prior company. Then, just as they were locking in plans for the IPO back in July, they were hit by a highly unwelcome complication: Geeta learned she had early-stage breast cancer.

‚ÄúShe got the call (from her doctor) during a call with investors,‚Äù Henrik says. Despite that bombshell, she continued working with banks and investors in the weeks that followed, even as she underwent two surgical procedures and radiation therapy. Her medical therapy concluded in November.

Henrik, who marvels at her fortitude throughout the health crisis says, ‚Äúshe only missed something like one day of work...That's just how she is. She works tirelessly.‚Äù

## Fisker Ocean

The Fisker Ocean will have a nearly 300-mile range with an 80 kWh battery and a solar panel roof as a range extender, adding approximately 1,000 free miles of range per year. Advanced electronics will be housed under the hood, and the vehicle will incorporate recycled and sustainable materials throughout. Deliveries of the Ocean are scheduled to begin in 2022.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s87j6bdsfw171.png?width=438&format=png&auto=webp&s=e40add9ce53319d31db242cce73a303afb03cbab

Fisker has also announced a partnership with Electrify America to ensure Fisker Ocean vehicles will integrate seamlessly with Electrify America charging stations when the e-SUV hits the market. With features such as a solar roof and recycled inner materials, it will be, according to Fisker Inc., the ""world's most sustainable vehicle.""

In 2017, Fisker Inc. announced that it had filed patents on flexible solid-state battery designs. Fisker expected the batteries to be produced on a mass scale around 2020. A prototype of the battery debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018. In October 2018, Fisker announced new funding for battery development through Caterpillar Venture Capital. The solid-state batteries are intended to deliver longer vehicle range and faster charging times.

In 2018, Fisker was named to the board of directors of First Cobalt, a North American cobalt refinery that produces battery materials.

In September 2019, it was announced that Fisker Inc. was partnering with Game of Thrones actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who will serve as a partner and sustainability adviser to Fisker, to work on advanced, affordable, electric mobility models.

&#x200B;

[In addition to being a well-known actor, Coster-Waldau is also the United Nations Development Program Goodwill Ambassador for climate change and other social issues.](https://preview.redd.it/3hssff5vfw171.png?width=451&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebe55e2468c5b63d1bc0ac3c71547219dff5afaa)

Nikolaj wrote this piece about Fisker:

To quote a friend of mine who is a lot smarter than me, architect Bjarke Ingels: ‚ÄúThe idea that sustainability needs to sacrifice quality of life is a flawed one. It‚Äôs a design challenge, a challenge to build something that transforms the idea of sustainability into something that will increase the quality of life for all those around it.‚Äù

One person meeting that challenge is Henrik Fisker, who has designed some of the most iconic cars over the past decades for BMW and others, like the BMW Z8, Aston Martin DB9 and Aston Martin V8 Vantage. He‚Äôs a hero for gas-guzzling supercars. He is a fellow Dane, I am a fan, and we met, of all places, on Twitter.

When we met in person, he described his new project ‚Äî an all-electric luxury SUV ‚Äî and asked me if I would help spread the word on his car. The problem as I see it with most electric cars is that they only accomplish the basics. They get you from point A to B. They run electric so you don‚Äôt pollute while driving, but that‚Äôs it. They are basically unattractive combustion engine cars that have a battery thrown into them ‚Äî and for most of them, a battery with a limited range. What Fisker does is to try to make every part of the car in a sustainable and attractive way, like a full-length solar roof, recycled floor mats and vegan leather seats. It looks incredibly cool and inviting, with a great 250- to 300-mile range, and at a cost of just under $40,000, it‚Äôs a luxury car affordable to a mass market.

I said yes and even became an investor, not only because it‚Äôs a great car but more importantly, I hope and believe it can inspire other companies to actively incorporate sustainability goals into all aspects of their business. Fisker then had the idea of calling me ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù adviser. Which I am not. Just to be clear. Thanks Henrik, sounds cool, but I am an actor and a citizen, and that‚Äôs really it.

And what about Hollywood? Is our industry changing, are we at the forefront? Looking at social media, you would think so. And things are happening, but usually only when a camera is pointed at people. Remember a few years back when all awards shows only used EVs for the red carpet? We made a difference. We mattered. We showed the way. So cool. So green, so ‚Ä¶ brief. Now it‚Äôs back to the Escalade. But hey, we are not using plastic straws anymore!

To believe that change will come from Hollywood is not really based in reality (when did that stop us?), but we are great at reacting ‚Äî and things around us are changing, and changing us. I have a good friend who loves his SUV. It‚Äôs not electric. But he cannot give up his car. He is a good guy, he‚Äôs works for the U.N., so if he has a problem going electric, we all do. But if he is presented with an alternative that doesn‚Äôt mean a reduction in his quality of life, something like the Fisker SUV, I think he‚Äôd transition to electric in a heartbeat.

The IPO deal values Fisker Inc at US$2.9 billion, with an IPO share price of $10.

On July 30, 2020, Fisker announced plans for a four-vehicle portfolio by 2025. The Fisker Ocean SUV will be joined by a sports sedan based on their previously announced Fisker Emotion concept, a coupe-like SUV, and a lifestyle pickup truck. All will be electric vehicles.

On October 15, 2020, Fisker Inc announced it would be outsourcing vehicle production of its Fisker Ocean electric SUV to Magna Steyr, to reduce the complexities and costs related to the building and operating its own factory. Magna will start building the Fisker Ocean in Europe in 2022.

## Henrik Fisker Interview quotes:

I have people on Twitter saying, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just make the car next month? You have a prototype.‚Äù Most people don‚Äôt understand that it takes 18 months to do long-lead body tooling for high-volume vehicles. Most people don‚Äôt understand it takes two years to do durability tests and do all the engineering certification and everything else.

And on the business model itself, I believe that there is nobody in the near future or the next couple of years that‚Äôs going to make a million EVs on one model. Today, there‚Äôs nobody doing it. Tesla probably has the highest volume of one single model, a couple hundred thousand. But even the big giant established carmakers are not making, right now, a couple hundred thousand vehicles of one model. So the way you get volume, in my view, is if you partner up with other OEMs and share some of the expensive parts of the platform, which in my view is not anymore something that is unique IP or something that is a unique experience to the customer. An aluminum stamped floor or a steel stamped floor really doesn‚Äôt have any brand value anymore.

And obviously, as we move forward, we always start to do some of the things ourselves. But it was really about de-risking in our first vehicle to market. So we‚Äôre going to do another three vehicles, which we can do because we don‚Äôt have to spend all our money and effort on learning how to manufacture a car, for instance.

So we have programmed a lot. We have hired a head of ESG, environmental and social governance, and he is really spearheading developing specific... we kind of put out some goals that we would like to reach with suppliers, and we at least try to bring them in that direction. They are not reaching those goals right now, but they may reach them later. And then we have goals for ourselves. So for instance, we look at transport. Are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs closer to the plant, or are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs on the other side of the planet that way we have to then transport all that stuff. So those are the types of things that we‚Äôre really thinking about now as we‚Äôre nominating suppliers. And finally, materials as well, looking at sustainable materials. We‚Äôve actually picked up a lot of knowledge on that side as well, where we are adding more sustainable materials to our vehicle. So we are actually looking across everything ‚Äî supply chain, where the suppliers are located, what the suppliers are doing for sustainability, and also then of course in the vehicle itself ‚Äî in terms of the type of materials there.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nb8ozukrpw171.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd5a515f831dedcc57b25d717c5c133c0c74299d

So - let's summarize - prices are rising at their fastest pace in almost 30 years and incomes just plunged by their most ever! We're gonna need more stimmies!""  

Plus  to above; 

Last year, Hirschman Capital noted that since 1821, 98% of sovereigns that hit 130% debt/GDP have defaulted on their sovereign debt.   

The US hit 130% late last year. 

Simple Conclussion : The Fed can‚Äôt go ‚Äúhawkish‚Äù and raise rates without sending markets ‚Äìand economies‚Äìto their knees; by extension, they now have nothing left to ‚Äúcut‚Äù when the current everything bubble implodes.

And that  is a *real problem*.

 There are only two ways for sovereigns to default: 

Inflation or collapse.    

The latter is not an option. 

 As for a solution, what‚Äôs so tragic is that the only option before the Fed is an even bigger problem‚Äîcurrent and inevitably more inflation. 

 That is, if the Fed wants to keep markets (and their job security) breathing, they no longer have the foregoing template of ‚Äúrate-hike-followed-by-rate-cutting‚Äù at their disposal, which means they now have no choice but to dovishly keep rates near the zero-bound indefinitely.

But the only way to keep rates ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù and nailed to the floor of time is to purchase otherwise unwanted bonds to keep their prices elevated and hence yields and rates repressed.

Such bond ‚Äúaccommodation,‚Äù of course, costs money, and as we already know, the only ‚Äúmoney‚Äù the Fed has to spend is the kind they create out of thin air‚Äì the very kind of money (and policy) which leads to the kind of inflation discussed above‚Äînamely, the brutal kind.

 As for that fake money, the evidence of the Fed‚Äôs desperate (and only) direction is now obvious, as the following M2 money supply makes equally clear. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v774ta55sw171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e73c839beb67a67eea9aed7de4ac61d86813840

 

Fed is so embarrassed by this ‚Äúprinting solution‚Äù that they‚Äôve stopped *weekly* reporting of M2 data, and frankly, since March, have even stopped *monthly* reporting of the same.

That, of course, is both telling as well as disgraceful‚Ä¶ The Fed literally has something to hide, and that never bodes well, does it?

&#x200B;

 The correlation to central bank balance sheet (i.e., money supply) expansion and rising markets is now beyond dispute. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sgizb6xcsw171.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=aad2fe681fe0c49ac20368aba77e86c118b22959

 In short‚Äîdo you see the correlation and pattern? Do you see how the Fed‚Äôs market sausage is made? More importantly, do you now see the Fed‚Äôs self-made conundrum? 

 

Given that the Fed bows to the markets not the people, which choice do you think they‚Äôll make?

In other words, expect more money printing and more yield curve control‚Äîand hence more money creation, more inflation, and by extension more fiat currency debasement.

 More money supply to keep rates monetized simply means more currency debasement and rising inflation.",nn51ou,"""Fed's ""Favorite"" #Inflation Indicator (PCE) Explodes At Fastest Rate Since 1992 As Incomes Crash By Record"""

4801,,2021-05-28 20:45:08,t3_nn76we,,wallstreetbets,"TLDR:

I have leading indicators telling me that there are two concurrent shifts underway when it comes to who is purchasing homes.

\- Massive increase in unmarried people buying houses alone. This used to be somewhat unusual, now it's becoming very common.

\- Massive increase in unmarried men, in particular, buying houses alone. Traditionally, the female-to-male ratio of unmarried homebuyers was about 5 to 1. For the last 3 months, it's been closer to 50/50.

Source is my own closed real estate purchase transactions. Am a mortgage broker (btw this means cash purchases are ""invisible"" to me). It takes 3-6 months for [HMDA data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Mortgage_Disclosure_Act) to become accessible to journalists and academics, and thus ""visible"" to the general public (assuming journalists deem it worthy of commenting on), but I can see the trends live in real time.

How would one go about placing a bet that in about 3 or 6 months, the media, journalists, academics, etc, will pick up on this, publish articles, and potentially cause a lot of people to buy certain stocks. Which stocks would that be? Is there a ""Mancave, Inc"" out there that would potentially get an uptick? Or maybe a company making smart-home stuff that is particularly suited to renting by the room (the single men are not buying 1 bedroom condos, they are buying proper houses with 3 bedrooms, etc)?

EDIT: oh, and to be clear. It's not just an uptick in single men. It's an uptick in women too, but a massive surge from the men. It used to be that for 15 banana sales, 10 are to married couples, 4 to single women, and 1 to a single man. Now for the same 15 banana sales, it's 6 to married couples, 6 to single women, and 3 to single men, something like that.",nn76we,Homebuyer Demographics Shift towards single and male. How to bet?

For me, at this point after watching BB take a hit in the market for months, it comes down to a few main points. 

1. The market does *not* seem to favor BB in the way that it‚Äôs lenient to the rest of the tech sector in terms of growth potential vs current revenue.

2. Good tech does not necessarily imply good revenue. BB hasn‚Äôt yet fully convinced me that they stand to make a killing off their tech, even if it‚Äôs the best in its niche.

3. Opportunity cost. How long am I willing to let this thing trade sideways before it starts reflecting the quality of its tech? What if it hits a valuation in the meme craze that reflects what its valuation should be on fundamentals in a year?

I can‚Äôt give you a price target, and anyone here who confidently throws a number out of their ass is completely full of shit. I‚Äôd honestly be surprised if it becomes stable at or above $15 EOY on non-meme valuation. 

Personally, I‚Äôll probably dump my shares during the meme hype and pick some back up after the hype dies.",,

For example, you buy Stock A for $10 a share, and sell it at $12 a share. You made money. However, say the stock rallies later in the week to $30-40 a share. You could describe the experience as ""Ah shit, I paperhanded and sold at $12, now it's $30, fuck."" Generally, I've also seen it used to refer to people who sell at the first sign of trouble, instead of holding through ""paper"" losses (e.g. losses not becoming realized until you close a position). 

Profit taking is when you have already made a lot of money. Using example from before, you held Stock A from $10 to $30 a share. You can (and should) take profits. You do this by selling some of your position. So if you had 10 shares, you'd sell 5-6 depending on comfort, in order to ""take profit"" while keeping the other 5-4 in play to see if the stock continues to rise. It is basically a hedge against being up a huge % and then seeing it all wiped out by holding. Positions are not all or nothing--you can sell some shares and leave others in to see what happens.",,

[When we last left our hero,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrly28/the_legend_of_utheemperorofjenks_aka_ornamental/) he had just lost all of his rent money and what he could advance from credit cards on a failed Super Bowl bet, and a YOLO on ‚ÄúRhodium‚Äù that he ordered from a sketchy Slovakian Wish.com ripoff. Alas, it was, of course, fake, and he was broke and depressed. It might have been the first fatal case of autism. He thought to himself ‚ÄúAm I really that retarded?‚Äù Then, he realized ‚ÄúNo, it must be Oklahoma that‚Äôs retarded!‚Äù

So, [after a brief case of violent diarrhea from Oklahoma Grocery Store sushi](https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/lrslbb/psa_do_not_eat_grocery_store_sushi_right_now/), he was ready to hatch his plan! Uruguay! Yes, Uruguay. [He was going to move to Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lh5igx/c%C3%B3mo_se_puede_llegar_a_melo_desde_montevideo_sin/)

His plans for this move could‚Äôve been anyone‚Äôs guess. One possibility he inquired about was [how to be a Tea Blendmaster.](https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/lfga0m/how_does_one_become_a_blendmaster/) [Another was him possibly reconnecting with God.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/lsij6j/agnostic_jew_seeking_faith_in_god/) Yet, he seemed to be asking questions about another topic more often than the others...

[Bees.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lxcnt1/c%C3%B3mo_es_la_legalidad_de_la_apicultura_informal/)

Specifically, beekeeping, a topic he admitted he had no experience in, [as evident from him looking for any book on the subject as an introduction months before.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/)

What he planned on doing with the bees was anyone‚Äôs guess, and I doubt he thought it through that much either. One post **AFTER** he took possession of 200,000 bees (we‚Äôll get to that later,) was [asking Americans if there was a demand for mead in the states.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/) So, was he thinking of importing Uruguayan honey to the US to be made into mead? Was he going to make it himself? Did he move to another continent for no reason? Let‚Äôs all find out!

A little more than 2 months ago, he finally did it. [He moved to Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/m9ejpn/la_paloma/) And about a week after that, [he was driving a truck filled with 200k bees across his new country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/) Based on replies in that thread, he was aiming to have [a monopoly on beekeeping in the country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/gt48gke/)

[He picked up his hives without complication.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mtkkf3/about_to_upsize_my_apiary_whats_the_best_layout/) [And then he settled into Melo, Uruguay, and set up his apiary ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/n1jnte/my_humble_apiary_near_melo_uruguay/). Life was good.

But, trouble was afoot. According to a reply, [the species he was planning on keeping had literally never been kept by keepers in Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mtkkf3/about_to_upsize_my_apiary_whats_the_best_layout/gv0viej/) And then, disaster struck. [He went to TIFU to post his tale of spreading an invasive species in an industry he knew nothing about.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/nmd69k/tifu_by_importing_bees_to_uruguay/)

Indeed, he had no idea even what a bee was until he stumbled his way through a book, and then decided to YOLO into honey in Uruguay. He somehow got in touch with an ecology professor in Montevideo that would help him set things up in exchange for grad students fucking with them every now and again. Oh, and the bees were from fucking Myanmar. Handshake agreement, of course. Total Chad move.

And like I said before, the rest went without incident for a while. It would take the bees ‚Äúa year‚Äù to make honey, so he just kinda hung out, stayed busy, and tried to find part time work in a foreign country he arrived in 2.5 months earlier.

And then, the professor ghosted him. Just disappeared. Shortly thereafter, government agents come out about this kid from Oklahoma illegally importing a non-native bee to their country. Apparently his bees had been fucking with other apiaries. So, he did probably the smartest thing he‚Äôs ever done.

He ran.

He fucking ran from the Uruguayan government, took a plane to LAX, and arrived with $14 to his name. His friend sent him $100, which wasn‚Äôt enough to go back to Oklahoma, so he took a $75 flight to Seattle, where he is also not from.

His last post is from a train out of the airport, with $39 to his name. I don‚Äôt know what is in store for him, but I know that $39 is as good as spent on urchin futures or whatever market he‚Äôs going to crash up there.

5644,,2021-05-28 03:12:37,t3_nmofz4,,wallstreetbets,"This started as a comment reply but I thought maybe people would like reading it. I've been researching Palantir since literally late November 2020 and I have nearly my entire portfolio in LEAPS expiring January 2023. So I have continually done more research on them this is just the basics to clear up confusion and help people who don't understand it because it's hard to hear all the hype and stuff. Also AMC to the moon tomorrow for my FDs I bought!! Don't judge me it's just fun to be in on the action on weeks like this.


So you should think of palantir as basically three companies and they actually are very far from unprofitable. 

They developed the really massive government software (gotham) specifically as a result of an interaction that happened to Peter Thiel while he was at paypal. They were losing millions to foreign scammers at paypal and the solution ended up being a high quality algorithm that flagged the most likely scam transactions and then allowed analysts to efficiently double check and verify the real scam transactions.

 It essentially was using what computers are efficient at (sorting through massive amounts of data) and then combining that with what humans are good at (looking at the more complex nuances that at least at that point computer algorithms were incapable of doing) and augmenting the humans ability to make complex decisions by rapidly sorting through the incoming data and bringing everything good to their attention.

They fixed paypals using this method and literally made the company profitable overnight because of fixing how much they were losing in the scam transactions. The FBI contacted PayPal and Thiel about using that initial software. That was literally his inspiration for what would become Palantir. He goes over it in huge detail in his book zero to one. If you make an audible account you can read it for free and find the chapter I'm talking about.

Then for 15 years they perfected the government software into the absolute nearly monopoly it is now in government intelligence augmentation software. The whole time though they reinvested almost everything for the last 10 years into building the commercial software (Foundry). That side of the business has only been live for a VERY short time and initially they literally didn't spend a single dollar on marketing their first commercial clients sought THEM out because of their insane reputation with the government. Foundry helps with supply chains and all kinds of other important data  insights. But if you want a recent example the NIH and the NHS both used Foundry to figure out how to best distribute the vaccine and vaccine distribution in the US and Britain has far outpaced expectations. You think commercial companies aren't going to be interested in using the software that was literally proven on a level like that?

 They're only just now adding huge amounts of people to their sales teams literally in the last six months which if you read Peter thiels book is insane for the stock because they have this crazy long term plan and he literally talks about how when they get to a certain point and start adding sales as a full sector of the company it means that is the company the company plans to BEGIN scaling. Meaning they're this big and they literally only just started on the scaling part. Which they've also said in tons of interviews if you're a die hard Palantirian like me. 



They actually also have the third side of the  business which is their actual like full AI for weaponization and war and defense for the government. Gotham is like helping analysts and commanders lead and even helping police or agents figure out what's going on. This other software is different. It's called Apollo and its only at the beginning too. It's like pure AI machine learning AI handles everything stuff. Go find a video called pentagon head of NSC briefs public on AI I think it's on the PBS channel on YouTube or some shit. Or you can listen to Joe Biden talk about how we're going to double our percentage of gdp spending on AI. The amount of government money that's going to go into AI as a weapon to compete with China DWARFS peoples expectations of how much large the market for the kind of software palantir makes is. 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201001005334/en/U.S.-Army-Research-Lab-Selects-Palantir-Technologies-Inc.-for-91M-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-Development

This is literally the backbone of everything AI that the government is about to invest in. Sure they're going to experiment with other research but if you do research you'll also find Palantir is the ONLY company that does anything remotely like this software that has anywhere near the kind of clearances like what is required for these contracts. They are currently a clearance level 5 and about to be the highest 6. The closest competitors are almost all a 3 or lower I'm not even sure if there's more than a single 4 and that stuff is crazy hard to get. 

But like again I'm an obsessive. I realize why people get so excited about the commercial side scaling and how it's very possible and can make them huge and it will. But I'm actually pretty sure the reason people like Cathy Wood has such a huge boner for them is that she realizes how MASSIVELY. And I mean MASSIVELY underestimated the amount of government revenue they will get from all this AI investing the United States and NATO are about to do. It's literally the next Manhattan project and they're absolutely going to be one of the biggest players developing it if not the biggest. I think it's funny because most people are pretty disinterested in the government stuff for Palantir but i really think the weaponized AI apollo stuff may be as big as anything could ever be. 




Also people got the insider selling stuff very very wrong. Tom Nash (love him or hate him I don't care) has a few really good recent videos where he explains it in basically full detail what was happening. The selling panicked a lot of retail investors during a time when the buying for growth markets had really slowed because of rate hike due to inflation scares and a ton of retail holders got scared and caused more selling and more people got scared because of that and sold and it really just was mass psychology in effect and a LOT of FUD and confusion. 

Basically a few executives karp in particular got billions of dollars worth of options that vest but literally expire so you have to exercise them which means you buy shares of the company at a strike price. Well because it's the company granting shares the strike price is literally 10 cents or something and these automatically have to vest at quarterly increments. So everytime karp was exercising he's actually buying shares. Like over 150 million in total maybe a lot more million SHARES not dollars. shares. And even those when he exercising he's buying shares technically from the company it ALL counts as profit on taxes and ITS NOT LONG TERM CAP GAINS ELIGIBLE. So over the last year plus this year he's essentially getting shares but the literal dollar value of those shares to the government counts as pure profit. So his total income which he's getting taxed at 40% of is in the BILLIONS yes billions. Because that's a lot to handle people that work for them actually automatically schedule sells of shares to cover the taxes so that there's no issue it's not even like him saying sell today and they do this.... TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INSIDER SELLING TO THE SEC. That's why it's automatically happening so no one can ever claim he's timing it. 

So listen cause here's where it gets important. The exercising of the shares counts as almost pure profits but remember he's receiving SHARES not dollars he doesn't actually get billions of dollars. So has to then sell SOME of the shares so he can pays taxes on that. Then when he sells the shares to pay the taxes for exercising he actually owes even more money if they went up from when he exercised. So everytime he's selling low its actually good for him because it's less ADDITIONAL PROFIT that he would owe taxes on.

 If he wasn't selling its because he thought it would go down even further and then he would actually owe less taxes overall. So if he thought it was going to tank he'd wait and actually get a nice fat discount on his taxes. 

I know this seems really crazy but I promise that's how it works you can look it up in detail but yeah shocking that mainstream media and redditors/youtubers who barely do research and have no real understanding of how these billion dollar compensations work would get it wrong. Unbelievable I know. If he had actually sold the massive overall percentage of his shares that some people claim he did the company would be at like $3-6 dollars not low 20s. Retail got confused because of market pressured due to interest rate fears from inflation and sold low (like retail always does) to institutions.",nmofz4,"Palantir DD if you want to understand company and it's history better (also insider ""selling"" explained in detail)"

What is Blue Apron?


Blue Apron (NYSE: APRN) was the forgotten step child, bad luck Brian, IPO of summer 2017 that priced below range and had the misfortune of debuting after Amazon bought Whole Foods. Since it‚Äôs debut, the stock has suffered dropping from nearly $150 per share (adjusted for a 2019 reverse-split necessitated to stay listed) to as low as approximately $2.00!


Why the Drop?


Management. Fucking. Sucked. The prior executive team essentially handed Chad Hello Fresh the keys to the kingdom, when they made the fatal error of betting that the ‚Äúhigh affinity core users‚Äù would be enough to sustain the business. For this reason, they cut marketing to nearly nothing and attempted to realize operating leverage by shrinking the customer base only to its most prolific buyers.

This was stupid. HelloFresh did the opposite, essentially giving away meals, and they used it to stockpile market share. Put a chart up of HelloFresh customers against Blue Apron. You‚Äôll see the two lines converge and a clear indication that HelloFresh stole most of their business. HelloFresh was one of the best trades of the past 5 years. Look at the chart, look at the sales, and look at the margins. They have managed to achieve operating leverage by employing affordable pricing and emphasizing retention.


Blue Apron Might Go Under....


Today the company is in a dire place. Languishing away in Micro Cap hell at an $80M market cap, no one on Wall Street wants to cover these guys. Only their bankers, CG and MS, write them research and neither are overly optimistic. They‚Äôre in a shit spot with a credit line that mandates they keep $15M cash at all times, and they keep their customer base above 300K (thus far, they‚Äôve struggled). They‚Äôre sitting on $29M and burn enough cash per Q that they might go below that $15M level (wouldn‚Äôt be a first). All signs are negative...


But I Think They Might Win


Blue Apron is under new management. Linda Kozlowski, is the former COO of ETSY and an ex-strategist at Alibaba. She believes HelloFresh did things right and she wants to right the ship. Her ballsy-ass plan is to ride the line on cash and go all in on customer growth. She realizes those customers are worth a lot more than income on the P&L, and that she needs to make the pot as big as she can. Thus far, it‚Äôs worked. Customers are up over 20% in the past two periods and retention rates are rising. We are seeing signs of operating leverage, and it opens a big possibility.


My Prediction

Management is buying shares. They know the company is not healthy. The only logic is that they have a plan that‚Äôs working. You can‚Äôt sell a dying business with a shrinking share, but you can certainly sell a growing community, that could be an accretive asset to a better capitalized entity. I think Linda is going either get the business in a position where it can refinance for better terms, or where it can be sold to create shareholder value via a strategic alternative.

If that happen, given this is priced for bankruptcy and ignored by the Street, the returns could easily reach the triple digits. I‚Äôm long and I plan to add on additional weakness.

Everyone is talking about how the squeeze didn't even happen and the shorts didn't cover yet. What I don't understand is why wouldn't that be possible? If short interest is 17%, so let's round up to about 100M shares. Today the volume traded was 700M shares. Couldn't 100M of those 700M have been the shorts covering? And if they didn't cover, today alone 700M shares were traded, why would 100M shares bought by shorts cause a squeeze if today 700M were traded?

I have been having this question for awhile, since I noticed the same with GME. In the days preceding January 28th (when GME reached its peak), the combined volume was several times the amount of float. How come the squeeze happened and why did it happen? If the volume was so high, couldn't the shorts have covered in the days preceding that?

I hope this makes sense and I really hope someone will be kind enough to explain a fellow retard who only knows about crayons what this all means.

Everything looked to have gone off successfully. We are now waiting on the data and craft to be analysed and inspected. This will take a few weeks according to Michael Colglazier.
That being said he had already outlined the test schedule in the earnings zoom call.

1st test flight - may 
2nd crewed flight - June 
3rd flight with R Branson on board late June/July 

4th flight this will be taking the Italian airforce on a training mission (600k a seat) late July


On the run in to the first test flight some possible maintenance issues appeared with the carrier plane White knight 2‚Ä¶. 
This indeed could have gone either way , after 2 weeks inspections it was decided that WK2 did not need to delay testing no maintenance was needed at this point. Scheduled Maintenance will commence in the fall after all tests have been completed.
Upon this news it is my opinion that the testing programme will go ahead as planned.

The market has responded accordingly and the stock is now up from $17-‚Ç¨31

I had a look at $BB and assume that we finally formed the bottom. In the last few days we saw a sharp rise which might continue in the next weeks. If we can break the 12$ resistance, the next targets would be aroung 25-28$. 

Using Elliot wave theory we are probably at the end of the correction wave 4 and now began with the bullish wave 5.

5667,,2021-05-28 09:17:32,t3_nmtt43,,wallstreetbets,"Trainline has taken a huge dip since the UK government's announcement of the plan to nationalise the railway network. The plan includes creating an online ticketing platform by Great British Railways which might have a huge blow on Trainline revenue. However, this platform does not yet exist and will probably take a couple of years to develop. Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed.

In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales.  Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%.

I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time  for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

5672,,2021-05-28 10:41:01,t3_nmuzzi,,wallstreetbets,"Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent of Modernas if not more. Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects) 

Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

Imagine if the spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize one piece to understand the whole picture it and helps modify your DNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates it can still recognize the virus. In contrast to using one portion of the picture as it mutates it's easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine, that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. Not only that but they have had the least amount of side effects of any covid vaccine deeming it the safest covid vaccine.... 

And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein (whole picture) and the safety profile. Also worth a mention is that you could store it in a regular refrigerator, and let it sit out in room temperature while you're vaccinating people instead of a special ultra low temp freeze needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers, this is a majority of the world. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines so other protein competitors will be far behind and they will have an a moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing they teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine. They will be combining flu and covid vaccine by 2025 for possibly double the price of current covid vaccine.

 They are pretty much de-risked at this point. Yes you could buy other  biotechs that can go up 20x but are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up) that has all successful trials done so far, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment to where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place there are no more glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""

They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. Yesterday at market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. 
 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

Future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract in there ( in the link below in another message). It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 

I own some $200 July calls along with about 933 shares. I'm all in baby.  Been in since $3.84 I sold once during February a couple months back and got back in a bit too early but I'm diamond hands all the way to $800 from here.  LFG I expect to turn that into over a cool million in a year's time via shares and options

Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. This is huge as the combo is going to differentiate them especially since both flu and covid vaccines are first in class.

2) Being that we do not have access to a 10-K filing for Q4 fiscal '19, we will access other filings that do in fact reference numbers from fiscal '19...
A) 10-K filing dated 9/11/2020
B) 10-Q filing dated 5/6/2020
3) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $223.3M under Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19)
But, that is TOTAL Revenue; we need to find out what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike sales...
4) To calculate what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike Sales, we can use numbers from neighboring Q3 (i.e. Three Months Ended March 31, 2019)...
A) On page 6 of the 10-Q, you will find Revenue of ""Connected Fitness Products"" (aka Bike Sales) to be $261.6M
B) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $316.7M
C) % of Bike Sales per TOTAL Revenue: $261.6M / $316.7M * 100 = 82.6% {""Connected Fitness Products"" Revenue (aka Bike Sales)}
5) Apply 82.6% to the TOTAL Revenue $223.3M for Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19): $223.3M x 0.826 = $184.45M {Bike Sales for Q4 of fiscal '19}
6) Per the CFO, ""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior."":

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote... By mid-July, we‚Äôll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase precious metals  especially silver amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative 

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

Gold rose over 60% in the 1930s as the prices of stocks and real estate crashed. You could buy an entire block with a one ounce gold coin. Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms.

I must address Cramer's statement because he is obviously trying to add fuel to the short-selling fire: When he says ""we're not going natural gas"" he is clearly making a vague and general statement meant to be interpreted in the worst possible way: ""no one is going to buy or use natural gas."" By now, I hope everyone that is interested in this stock understands that CLNE offers an alternative transportation fuel, thus, the investments made by BP and Chevron, and not revolutionary technology like some EV's (but this is mostly hype meant to catapult EVs to the front. What most people do not realize is that driverless technology and such can be placed in Petro vehicles too). Also, unfortunately, the company has done a terrible marketting job. That's why powerful analysts can get away with making vague and unsupported statements. The fact that Cramer explained the stock's decrease over the last month as being due to widespread dissaproval is misleading, at best. Many people do not yet know about the cleanliness and therapeutic effects RNG has on the climate.

The News...

If you haven't read yet it looks like Federal Cannabis legalization my be around the corner. [Here](https://www.mpp.org/policy/federal/the-more-act/) is the House Bill. Supporters seem on board and like the reforms they have done to the bill including rescheduling cannabis. [Last time](https://mjbizdaily.com/key-us-house-lawmaker-reintroduces-federal-marijuana-legalization-bill/) the bill was introduced it cleared the House.   


Personally I think this gets a lot of support especially from a fiscal point of view. With stimulus stalling and a giant debate going on about how to pay for the stimulus I think cannabis offers the easiest way to collect federal revenue. A simple review of the bill and the fiscal benefits to the Fed's can be read [here](https://www.justtherealnews.com/congress/nadler-blumenauer-lee-jackson-lee-jeffries-velazquez-reintroduce-comprehensive-marijuana-reform-legislation/). The bill states a 5% fed tax. Money coming for uncle Sam, right when questions about paying for stimulus.... Personally I think it adds up, but that's for you to decide. 

Okay so that's the hype...

Let's talk about the tickers listed ($SNDL and $TLRY). 

$SNDL

I'll start with the cheaper YOLO, $SNDL. $SNDL short interest isn't high, but the company did issue convertible notes a while back around .7c if my memory is correct. I'm not saying they won't do it again, but they should be in a good place fiscally for now. Float is high with about 1.6B shares out there. However today's volume at the time of writing is over 415M. That's not bad given such a high float. It's about 200% more than the average volume. 

The options chain on $SNDL has me giddy. With over 200,000 options currently in the money on todays move above $1 there is some high potential here for some interesting action. The put to call ratio is just obnoxiously low at .08 it's screaming upwards betting. If we hold above $1 the potential squeeze up could be amazing.   


It's also broken up on the trend lines and out of the downward channel it was in. The regression channel from the peak squeeze back in Feb just broke out today according to my crayons I have laying around. 

$TLRY

$TLRY was the squeeze of a lifetime if you remember it back in 19'. The ticker was just a money printer with it's low float and stupid hype. Then they proceeded to do, like they all do, and issue debt. Shares tumbled since then falling from $120 --> $5. Ouch bag holders.   


Like all the cannabis stocks the Feb bump pushed $TLRY to above $60 in an amazing move. $TLRY has a lower short interest than $SNDL, but it also has a much lower float at about 300M. Compared to $SNDL the volume here isn't as good, but still remains decently above the avg volume around 36M as of right now. 

If we peep the options chain we also see a crazy low P/C ratio around .11. But we don't have the Open Interest in the chain like $SNDL does unless you roll out to Jun 18. Then we finally get some decent OI.   


Personally I am going with $SNDL. The option's chain looks better, the stock is cheaper, and the short interest is a little better. My advice would be to roll out till at least the Jun 11th $1 strike to not get eaten alive by Theta and IV crush. But WSB does what WSB wants and that's why I love you all.   
Do not go above the $2 strikes IMO. You will get crushed by theta unless we get an insane move, which could happen but I don't see the risk / reward there.",nn326f,MORE ACT / CANNABIS / $SNDL & $TLRY Potential

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday

>Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers‚Äô attempt to corner the market on the metal.

-
>Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926‚Äì2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers‚Äô Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.

-
>By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged‚ÄîMarch 27‚Äîsilver fell to $10.80, the metal‚Äôs biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, ‚ÄúA billion dollars isn‚Äôt what it used to be,‚Äù the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.

-
>To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978‚Äì91) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities.",nn36fw,There is no silver short squeeze happening.

* 16,000+ reservations already. More than Tesla had 18 months pre-production
* Revenue streams include leasing automotives, servicing, selling emissions credits, selling insurance (like selling the pickaxe to miners, and selling the diamonds to the mine owners too, absolutely genius - Fisker are insuring cars which they own, because the customer is only leasing it)
* High short interest (20%+), high analyst price targets compared to current share price (100%+) and low valuation compared to peers ($3bn market cap currently)
* Designing the first ever all-electric popemobile - Massive, soon to be historic, event!

* Price Targets: $35 by end of year - Previous ATH. $50 start of next year - European and Chinese debut of prototypes. $100 end of 2022 - start of production (SOP). $150+ 2023
* 2025 Price Targets, calculated using projected data: Bear case - $97 a share, Bull case - $519 a share
* Downside in the short term is capped by the large amount of cash on hand - one third of market cap is cash. Long term, is capped by risk factors, which are almost eligible and affect every automotive startup anyway.

## Fisker Automotive

In 2008, Fisker Automotive raised over $90 million from investors including venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. In September 2009, Fisker Automotive was awarded a $528 million loan guarantee by the United States Department of Energy (DOE). The automaker was one of four recipients of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, to encourage the domestic manufacture of electric cars. The funds were to be used to develop the Karma, as well as an affordable family-size plug-in hybrid car. The loan facility was frozen at $192 million in February 2012, after the DOE claimed that Fisker missed its milestones

In December 2011, just as the Fisker Karma was launched, its battery supplier, A123 Systems, recalled all batteries, followed by a second recall in 2012. A123 filed for bankruptcy in October 2012, leaving Fisker Automotive without a battery supplier. After selling approximately 2,000 units, production of the Fisker Karma was suspended in November 2012, in the absence of its battery supplier.

Henrik Fisker resigned as chairman from Fisker Automotive in March 2013, because of disagreements with management about business strategy. Later that year, the company declared voluntary bankruptcy.Fisker raised and spent more than a billion dollars over its lifetime.The heart of Fisker‚Äôs business model was in that early deal with Quantum. The idea was to design a gorgeous car, and have suppliers like Quantum provide the technology because off-the-shelf parts from suppliers would help keep costs down.

But there were problems with this strategy: Sometimes, those parts had to be custom-made to fit the design vision, which resulted in higher prices for Fisker. Other times, parts were delivered late or, worse, faulty, but Fisker was locked in to those supplier relationships. Sources close to Fisker have also said that many of the parts were owned by the suppliers themselves, so Fisker didn‚Äôt own a lot of the internal technology.

The broker that raised funds for Fisker automotive, by selling their private shares, was Advanced Equities.It wasn‚Äôt until December 2011 and into 2012 that the more dubious efforts of Advanced Equities became clearer to Fisker‚Äôs hundreds of investors. The last few hundred million dollars of Advanced Equities‚Äô fund raising for Fisker, starting with the D-1 round, was what brokers call ‚Äúpay to play.‚Äù As Fisker was running into technical, delivery and political problems, its valuation was quickly declining. But the company still needed more money, so the brokers went back to its current investors and said: Unless you give this more, your current shares will be diluted and your preferred stock will be converted to common stock.

It was essentially a gun to their heads. This is why investor Wray sued Fisker in February 2012, alleging he was on the receiving end of this tactic. In his lawsuit, he says Advanced Equities sent him a letter dated Jan. 18, 2012, stating that he needed to decide if he wanted to invest in Fisker‚Äôs next round, and pay around $84,000 by Jan. 27, 2012 ‚Äî a little over a week from receiving the letter. He also says that Advanced Equities assured him that he would have anti-dilution protection. According to the audio clip from Advanced Equities‚Äô internal sales call in early 2010, Advanced Equity leaders say that the Fisker deal will ‚Äúsuffer no dilution,‚Äù and was ‚Äúa dream scenario.‚Äù

That dream would soon end. In September 2012 after Fisker closed on $1.2 billion in funding, the bulk of it organized by Advanced Equities, the SEC charged the broker with misleading investors when it raised money for another company back in 2009 and 2010 (Bloom Energy). Advanced settled, agreeing to pay $1 million, and its co-founders were personally fined. Two months later Advanced Equities closed up shop.

Later, A123 Systems itself went bankrupt, causing more problems for Fisker. Fisker claimed that A123 Systems owed it $140 million, but a bankruptcy settlement reduced that to a paltry $15 million.

Then there was the just plain terrible luck for the ironically named Karma: Super Storm Sandy wiped out 338 of its Karmas in storage in New Jersey. The cars first drowned, and then caught on fire ‚Äî salt water damage caused a short circuit that was spread to other cars by high winds, Fisker said at the time.

With all of this happening in public ‚Äî and in a presidential election year ‚Äî Fisker‚Äôs struggles became highly politicized. The company was mentioned numerous times in presidential debates and speeches leading up to the election. Republican nominee Romney called Fisker and other DOE-supported companies losers.

The company didn‚Äôt seem to invest substantially in technology innovation or tech IP, and seemed to spend a disproportionate amount on suppliers. For example, numerous sources have said that the company paid upfront for 15,000 of some of the parts for its planned 15,000 Karmas. It ended up only selling around 2,000 of the cars. It has also been said that Fisker paid some funds upfront to have BMW make engines for the 100,000 Nina cars it hoped to produce ‚Äî in the end, Fisker didn‚Äôt deliver a single Nina.

Costs to build each Karma also creeped up because the company missed its volume targets, and because engineering had to change designs around supplier constraints. The company ended up adding $20,000 to its initial sale price.

Expensive hires may also have sucked away chunks of Fisker‚Äôs funding: Sources say that Fisker filled the upper levels of the company with seasoned auto executives from Detroit. At the high point of Fisker, the company had around 300 employees, plus dozens of contract staff. Bringing in a certain amount of the old guard could help a car startup ramp up quickly, and also impress potential investors with ‚Äúindustry names.‚Äù But those people are also used to big auto-industry budgets that included extensive travel and salaries ‚Äî that‚Äôs the opposite life of a tech startup.

## Fisker Inc.

In July 2016, Henrik Fisker expressed interest in designing a fully connected electric car with autonomous driving features and an aesthetically pleasing look. He has pursued battery technology, and hinted at potentially reviving the Fisker name with a pure-electric vehicle using technology that nobody else has. Since then Fisker has talked about delays to the promised solid state battery technology, which he does not expect to be able to be produced in volume until at least 2025. Posing risk for competition from more scientifically experienced future solid state battery producers such as Quantumscape.

***Forbes:*** ‚ÄúNow he‚Äôs back‚Äìand three things are different. First and foremost, he has a vital new partner: his wife, cofounder and Fisker Inc. CFO Geeta Gupta-Fisker. Second, his Los Angeles-based company is public this time around, raising more than $1 billion in an October 2020 IPO. And finally, Fisker‚Äôs stock price, up 56% since its debut, has made both Henrik and Geeta billionaires, each worth about $1.1 billion as of Friday‚Äôs market close. The auto industry has seen father-son and sibling leadership teams, but Fisker Inc.‚Äôs CEO-CFO combo is the fast-changing sector‚Äôs first husband and wife power couple.‚Äù

Wealth isn‚Äôt the purpose of the new company, Henrik says. ‚ÄúI never got into cars because of money. (This shows he is willing to do what is in the best interest of the company because he is not motivated by money, unlike 99% of other CEO‚Äôs)

The couple sought a big stake in the new venture to ensure they can control its fate in a way Fisker couldn‚Äôt with his earlier company.

&#x200B;

Henrik is an auto industry celebrity, but Geeta‚Äôs background is equally impressive. A native of India, she holds multiple degrees in science, including a Ph.D. in biotechnology from Cambridge University where she was also a Research Newton Fellow. From there, she started a career in international investment for Lloyds Banking Group, and then managed investments for a high-net-worth client for several years. (In particular, this is insanely important - Geeta **KNOWS MONEY**! She knows how best to keep a company afloat, organize its share structure, provide value to shareholders, etc. because she has worked in the industry before. She may just be the most important element of Fisker Inc., due to the financial experience she has. At every step of the way, she is likely to make decisions with one sole focus - increasing share price and value).

She met her future husband in 2011 when he was visiting London, just before things started going very wrong at Fisker Automotive. They married in 2012.

‚ÄúWhen I left Fisker Automotive, all I had was my car,‚Äù Henrik remembers. ‚ÄúI'm in a different position, mainly because of Geeta. Because she cuts the deals.‚Äù

To get the new venture off the ground, the Fiskers invested the majority of their life savings‚Äìan enormous financial risk given the fate of Henrik‚Äôs prior company. Then, just as they were locking in plans for the IPO back in July, they were hit by a highly unwelcome complication: Geeta learned she had early-stage breast cancer.

‚ÄúShe got the call (from her doctor) during a call with investors,‚Äù Henrik says. Despite that bombshell, she continued working with banks and investors in the weeks that followed, even as she underwent two surgical procedures and radiation therapy. Her medical therapy concluded in November.

Henrik, who marvels at her fortitude throughout the health crisis says, ‚Äúshe only missed something like one day of work...That's just how she is. She works tirelessly.‚Äù

## Fisker Ocean

The Fisker Ocean will have a nearly 300-mile range with an 80 kWh battery and a solar panel roof as a range extender, adding approximately 1,000 free miles of range per year. Advanced electronics will be housed under the hood, and the vehicle will incorporate recycled and sustainable materials throughout. Deliveries of the Ocean are scheduled to begin in 2022.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s87j6bdsfw171.png?width=438&format=png&auto=webp&s=e40add9ce53319d31db242cce73a303afb03cbab

Fisker has also announced a partnership with Electrify America to ensure Fisker Ocean vehicles will integrate seamlessly with Electrify America charging stations when the e-SUV hits the market. With features such as a solar roof and recycled inner materials, it will be, according to Fisker Inc., the ""world's most sustainable vehicle.""

In 2017, Fisker Inc. announced that it had filed patents on flexible solid-state battery designs. Fisker expected the batteries to be produced on a mass scale around 2020. A prototype of the battery debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018. In October 2018, Fisker announced new funding for battery development through Caterpillar Venture Capital. The solid-state batteries are intended to deliver longer vehicle range and faster charging times.

In 2018, Fisker was named to the board of directors of First Cobalt, a North American cobalt refinery that produces battery materials.

In September 2019, it was announced that Fisker Inc. was partnering with Game of Thrones actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who will serve as a partner and sustainability adviser to Fisker, to work on advanced, affordable, electric mobility models.

&#x200B;

[In addition to being a well-known actor, Coster-Waldau is also the United Nations Development Program Goodwill Ambassador for climate change and other social issues.](https://preview.redd.it/3hssff5vfw171.png?width=451&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebe55e2468c5b63d1bc0ac3c71547219dff5afaa)

Nikolaj wrote this piece about Fisker:

To quote a friend of mine who is a lot smarter than me, architect Bjarke Ingels: ‚ÄúThe idea that sustainability needs to sacrifice quality of life is a flawed one. It‚Äôs a design challenge, a challenge to build something that transforms the idea of sustainability into something that will increase the quality of life for all those around it.‚Äù

One person meeting that challenge is Henrik Fisker, who has designed some of the most iconic cars over the past decades for BMW and others, like the BMW Z8, Aston Martin DB9 and Aston Martin V8 Vantage. He‚Äôs a hero for gas-guzzling supercars. He is a fellow Dane, I am a fan, and we met, of all places, on Twitter.

When we met in person, he described his new project ‚Äî an all-electric luxury SUV ‚Äî and asked me if I would help spread the word on his car. The problem as I see it with most electric cars is that they only accomplish the basics. They get you from point A to B. They run electric so you don‚Äôt pollute while driving, but that‚Äôs it. They are basically unattractive combustion engine cars that have a battery thrown into them ‚Äî and for most of them, a battery with a limited range. What Fisker does is to try to make every part of the car in a sustainable and attractive way, like a full-length solar roof, recycled floor mats and vegan leather seats. It looks incredibly cool and inviting, with a great 250- to 300-mile range, and at a cost of just under $40,000, it‚Äôs a luxury car affordable to a mass market.

I said yes and even became an investor, not only because it‚Äôs a great car but more importantly, I hope and believe it can inspire other companies to actively incorporate sustainability goals into all aspects of their business. Fisker then had the idea of calling me ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù adviser. Which I am not. Just to be clear. Thanks Henrik, sounds cool, but I am an actor and a citizen, and that‚Äôs really it.

And what about Hollywood? Is our industry changing, are we at the forefront? Looking at social media, you would think so. And things are happening, but usually only when a camera is pointed at people. Remember a few years back when all awards shows only used EVs for the red carpet? We made a difference. We mattered. We showed the way. So cool. So green, so ‚Ä¶ brief. Now it‚Äôs back to the Escalade. But hey, we are not using plastic straws anymore!

To believe that change will come from Hollywood is not really based in reality (when did that stop us?), but we are great at reacting ‚Äî and things around us are changing, and changing us. I have a good friend who loves his SUV. It‚Äôs not electric. But he cannot give up his car. He is a good guy, he‚Äôs works for the U.N., so if he has a problem going electric, we all do. But if he is presented with an alternative that doesn‚Äôt mean a reduction in his quality of life, something like the Fisker SUV, I think he‚Äôd transition to electric in a heartbeat.

The IPO deal values Fisker Inc at US$2.9 billion, with an IPO share price of $10.

On July 30, 2020, Fisker announced plans for a four-vehicle portfolio by 2025. The Fisker Ocean SUV will be joined by a sports sedan based on their previously announced Fisker Emotion concept, a coupe-like SUV, and a lifestyle pickup truck. All will be electric vehicles.

On October 15, 2020, Fisker Inc announced it would be outsourcing vehicle production of its Fisker Ocean electric SUV to Magna Steyr, to reduce the complexities and costs related to the building and operating its own factory. Magna will start building the Fisker Ocean in Europe in 2022.

## Henrik Fisker Interview quotes:

I have people on Twitter saying, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just make the car next month? You have a prototype.‚Äù Most people don‚Äôt understand that it takes 18 months to do long-lead body tooling for high-volume vehicles. Most people don‚Äôt understand it takes two years to do durability tests and do all the engineering certification and everything else.

And on the business model itself, I believe that there is nobody in the near future or the next couple of years that‚Äôs going to make a million EVs on one model. Today, there‚Äôs nobody doing it. Tesla probably has the highest volume of one single model, a couple hundred thousand. But even the big giant established carmakers are not making, right now, a couple hundred thousand vehicles of one model. So the way you get volume, in my view, is if you partner up with other OEMs and share some of the expensive parts of the platform, which in my view is not anymore something that is unique IP or something that is a unique experience to the customer. An aluminum stamped floor or a steel stamped floor really doesn‚Äôt have any brand value anymore.

And obviously, as we move forward, we always start to do some of the things ourselves. But it was really about de-risking in our first vehicle to market. So we‚Äôre going to do another three vehicles, which we can do because we don‚Äôt have to spend all our money and effort on learning how to manufacture a car, for instance.

So we have programmed a lot. We have hired a head of ESG, environmental and social governance, and he is really spearheading developing specific... we kind of put out some goals that we would like to reach with suppliers, and we at least try to bring them in that direction. They are not reaching those goals right now, but they may reach them later. And then we have goals for ourselves. So for instance, we look at transport. Are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs closer to the plant, or are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs on the other side of the planet that way we have to then transport all that stuff. So those are the types of things that we‚Äôre really thinking about now as we‚Äôre nominating suppliers. And finally, materials as well, looking at sustainable materials. We‚Äôve actually picked up a lot of knowledge on that side as well, where we are adding more sustainable materials to our vehicle. So we are actually looking across everything ‚Äî supply chain, where the suppliers are located, what the suppliers are doing for sustainability, and also then of course in the vehicle itself ‚Äî in terms of the type of materials there.

So - let's summarize - prices are rising at their fastest pace in almost 30 years and incomes just plunged by their most ever! We're gonna need more stimmies!""  

Plus  to above; 

Last year, Hirschman Capital noted that since 1821, 98% of sovereigns that hit 130% debt/GDP have defaulted on their sovereign debt.   

The US hit 130% late last year. 

Simple Conclussion : The Fed can‚Äôt go ‚Äúhawkish‚Äù and raise rates without sending markets ‚Äìand economies‚Äìto their knees; by extension, they now have nothing left to ‚Äúcut‚Äù when the current everything bubble implodes.

And that  is a *real problem*.

 There are only two ways for sovereigns to default: 

Inflation or collapse.    

The latter is not an option. 

 As for a solution, what‚Äôs so tragic is that the only option before the Fed is an even bigger problem‚Äîcurrent and inevitably more inflation. 

 That is, if the Fed wants to keep markets (and their job security) breathing, they no longer have the foregoing template of ‚Äúrate-hike-followed-by-rate-cutting‚Äù at their disposal, which means they now have no choice but to dovishly keep rates near the zero-bound indefinitely.

But the only way to keep rates ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù and nailed to the floor of time is to purchase otherwise unwanted bonds to keep their prices elevated and hence yields and rates repressed.

Such bond ‚Äúaccommodation,‚Äù of course, costs money, and as we already know, the only ‚Äúmoney‚Äù the Fed has to spend is the kind they create out of thin air‚Äì the very kind of money (and policy) which leads to the kind of inflation discussed above‚Äînamely, the brutal kind.

 As for that fake money, the evidence of the Fed‚Äôs desperate (and only) direction is now obvious, as the following M2 money supply makes equally clear. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v774ta55sw171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e73c839beb67a67eea9aed7de4ac61d86813840

 

Fed is so embarrassed by this ‚Äúprinting solution‚Äù that they‚Äôve stopped *weekly* reporting of M2 data, and frankly, since March, have even stopped *monthly* reporting of the same.

That, of course, is both telling as well as disgraceful‚Ä¶ The Fed literally has something to hide, and that never bodes well, does it?

&#x200B;

 The correlation to central bank balance sheet (i.e., money supply) expansion and rising markets is now beyond dispute. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sgizb6xcsw171.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=aad2fe681fe0c49ac20368aba77e86c118b22959

 In short‚Äîdo you see the correlation and pattern? Do you see how the Fed‚Äôs market sausage is made? More importantly, do you now see the Fed‚Äôs self-made conundrum? 

 

Given that the Fed bows to the markets not the people, which choice do you think they‚Äôll make?

In other words, expect more money printing and more yield curve control‚Äîand hence more money creation, more inflation, and by extension more fiat currency debasement.

 More money supply to keep rates monetized simply means more currency debasement and rising inflation.",nn51ou,"""Fed's ""Favorite"" #Inflation Indicator (PCE) Explodes At Fastest Rate Since 1992 As Incomes Crash By Record"""

I have leading indicators telling me that there are two concurrent shifts underway when it comes to who is purchasing homes.

\- Massive increase in unmarried people buying houses alone. This used to be somewhat unusual, now it's becoming very common.

\- Massive increase in unmarried men, in particular, buying houses alone. Traditionally, the female-to-male ratio of unmarried homebuyers was about 5 to 1. For the last 3 months, it's been closer to 50/50.

Source is my own closed real estate purchase transactions. Am a mortgage broker (btw this means cash purchases are ""invisible"" to me). It takes 3-6 months for [HMDA data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Mortgage_Disclosure_Act) to become accessible to journalists and academics, and thus ""visible"" to the general public (assuming journalists deem it worthy of commenting on), but I can see the trends live in real time.

How would one go about placing a bet that in about 3 or 6 months, the media, journalists, academics, etc, will pick up on this, publish articles, and potentially cause a lot of people to buy certain stocks. Which stocks would that be? Is there a ""Mancave, Inc"" out there that would potentially get an uptick? Or maybe a company making smart-home stuff that is particularly suited to renting by the room (the single men are not buying 1 bedroom condos, they are buying proper houses with 3 bedrooms, etc)?

EDIT: oh, and to be clear. It's not just an uptick in single men. It's an uptick in women too, but a massive surge from the men. It used to be that for 15 banana sales, 10 are to married couples, 4 to single women, and 1 to a single man. Now for the same 15 banana sales, it's 6 to married couples, 6 to single women, and 3 to single men, something like that.",nn76we,Homebuyer Demographics Shift towards single and male. How to bet?

NOK is making some hella moves, but granted maybe they‚Äôve catched on to us and they have call instead of puts for NOK and BB. Blackberry is higher than NOK but I think it deserves to be the other way around. 

For example, NOK just announced several agreements that allow them to expand overall networks in other countries, and if I‚Äôm understanding correctly it is contributing to expansion of infrastructure THATS HUGE. It‚Äôs undervalued - hella undervalued. 

BB is pure shitpost. The only news around it is that we‚Äôre talking about in Reddit. 

Thoughts?

What did everyone see three months ago with the initial squeeze? A lucky few who got positive and exited, and hundreds and HUNDREDS of retards who bought the peak, or near or, or ON THE WAY DOWN, , and were down thousands/tens of thousands of dollars because they got caught up in the craze. AMC reached the peak of this little run yesterday. Sell now and lock in your money so you actually GAIN something instead of HOPING you will gain something.

Note this was the ü¶ç‚Äôs first option trade so he was going bananas üçå seeing all that fucking ü§ë tendies. Ape was bullish and let the stock run until it got smack down. Instead of rolling the calls and taking a profit he was hopeful and waiting for the stock to bounce back up.

More sports betting on the Draftkings sportsbook and the Draftkings Daily fantasy will increase earnings for the company which is almost always good for stock growth.

Fidelity is, IMHO, the best place to go for your situation.  Been with them for decades.  You can transfer ($75 fee waived on >$25,000) your RH in a couple days.  Initiate on a Monday and usually be up & running by Wednesday/Thursday.

You're account will be margin from the start.  Then, you can apply for Level 1: Options. The basic covered call writing & buy-writes. Stay there for a while AFTER your feel comfortable with trading those.  Option Trading is split into five level based on complexity with each level adding more advance strategies.

Level 2:  Purchase of calls/puts and straddles/combinations (equity and index)
Level 3: Spreads and covered put writing
Level 4: Uncovered writing of equity options and uncovered writing of straddles/combinations on equities
Level 5: Uncovered writing of index options and uncovered writing of straddles/combinations on indexes

Levels 4 & 5 are the **DANGER: DO NOT ENTER, unless you really know what your doing.**  I'm happy hanging out at level 3 for a couple years. 1-3 are income generating levels, while 4 & 5 are pure speculation.

[When we last left our hero,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrly28/the_legend_of_utheemperorofjenks_aka_ornamental/) he had just lost all of his rent money and what he could advance from credit cards on a failed Super Bowl bet, and a YOLO on ‚ÄúRhodium‚Äù that he ordered from a sketchy Slovakian Wish.com ripoff. Alas, it was, of course, fake, and he was broke and depressed. It might have been the first fatal case of autism. He thought to himself ‚ÄúAm I really that retarded?‚Äù Then, he realized ‚ÄúNo, it must be Oklahoma that‚Äôs retarded!‚Äù

So, [after a brief case of violent diarrhea from Oklahoma Grocery Store sushi](https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/lrslbb/psa_do_not_eat_grocery_store_sushi_right_now/), he was ready to hatch his plan! Uruguay! Yes, Uruguay. [He was going to move to Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lh5igx/c%C3%B3mo_se_puede_llegar_a_melo_desde_montevideo_sin/)

His plans for this move could‚Äôve been anyone‚Äôs guess. One possibility he inquired about was [how to be a Tea Blendmaster.](https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/lfga0m/how_does_one_become_a_blendmaster/) [Another was him possibly reconnecting with God.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/lsij6j/agnostic_jew_seeking_faith_in_god/) Yet, he seemed to be asking questions about another topic more often than the others...

[Bees.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lxcnt1/c%C3%B3mo_es_la_legalidad_de_la_apicultura_informal/)

Specifically, beekeeping, a topic he admitted he had no experience in, [as evident from him looking for any book on the subject as an introduction months before.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/)

What he planned on doing with the bees was anyone‚Äôs guess, and I doubt he thought it through that much either. One post **AFTER** he took possession of 200,000 bees (we‚Äôll get to that later,) was [asking Americans if there was a demand for mead in the states.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/) So, was he thinking of importing Uruguayan honey to the US to be made into mead? Was he going to make it himself? Did he move to another continent for no reason? Let‚Äôs all find out!

A little more than 2 months ago, he finally did it. [He moved to Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/m9ejpn/la_paloma/) And about a week after that, [he was driving a truck filled with 200k bees across his new country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/) Based on replies in that thread, he was aiming to have [a monopoly on beekeeping in the country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/gt48gke/) 

And for a while, things were kind ok for our young Autist. [He picked up his hives without complication.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mtkkf3/about_to_upsize_my_apiary_whats_the_best_layout/) [And then he settled into Melo, Uruguay, and set up his apiary ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/n1jnte/my_humble_apiary_near_melo_uruguay/). Life was good.

But, trouble was afoot. According to a reply, [the species he was planning on keeping had literally never been kept by keepers in Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mtkkf3/about_to_upsize_my_apiary_whats_the_best_layout/gv0viej/) And then, disaster struck. [He went to TIFU to post his tale of spreading an invasive species in an industry he knew nothing about.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/nmd69k/tifu_by_importing_bees_to_uruguay/)

Indeed, he had no idea even what a bee was until he stumbled his way through a book, and then decided to YOLO into honey in Uruguay. He somehow got in touch with an ecology professor in Montevideo that would help him set things up in exchange for grad students fucking with them every now and again. Oh, and the bees were from fucking Myanmar. Handshake agreement, of course. Total Chad move.

And like I said before, the rest went without incident for a while. It would take the bees ‚Äúa year‚Äù to make honey, so he just kinda hung out, stayed busy, and tried to find part time work in a foreign country he arrived in 2.5 months earlier.

And then, the professor ghosted him. Just disappeared. Shortly thereafter, government agents come out about this kid from Oklahoma illegally importing a non-native bee to their country. Apparently his bees had been fucking with other apiaries. So, he did probably the smartest thing he‚Äôs ever done.

He ran.

He fucking ran from the Uruguayan government, took a plane to LAX, and arrived with $14 to his name. His friend sent him $100, which wasn‚Äôt enough to go back to Oklahoma, so he took a $75 flight to Seattle, where he is also not from.

His last post is from a train out of the airport, with $39 to his name. I don‚Äôt know what is in store for him, but I know that $39 is as good as spent on urchin futures or whatever market he‚Äôs going to crash up there.

5897,,2021-05-28 03:12:37,t3_nmofz4,,wallstreetbets,"This started as a comment reply but I thought maybe people would like reading it. I've been researching Palantir since literally late November 2020 and I have nearly my entire portfolio in LEAPS expiring January 2023. So I have continually done more research on them this is just the basics to clear up confusion and help people who don't understand it because it's hard to hear all the hype and stuff. Also AMC to the moon tomorrow for my FDs I bought!! Don't judge me it's just fun to be in on the action on weeks like this.


So you should think of palantir as basically three companies and they actually are very far from unprofitable. 

They developed the really massive government software (gotham) specifically as a result of an interaction that happened to Peter Thiel while he was at paypal. They were losing millions to foreign scammers at paypal and the solution ended up being a high quality algorithm that flagged the most likely scam transactions and then allowed analysts to efficiently double check and verify the real scam transactions.

 It essentially was using what computers are efficient at (sorting through massive amounts of data) and then combining that with what humans are good at (looking at the more complex nuances that at least at that point computer algorithms were incapable of doing) and augmenting the humans ability to make complex decisions by rapidly sorting through the incoming data and bringing everything good to their attention.

They fixed paypals using this method and literally made the company profitable overnight because of fixing how much they were losing in the scam transactions. The FBI contacted PayPal and Thiel about using that initial software. That was literally his inspiration for what would become Palantir. He goes over it in huge detail in his book zero to one. If you make an audible account you can read it for free and find the chapter I'm talking about.

Then for 15 years they perfected the government software into the absolute nearly monopoly it is now in government intelligence augmentation software. The whole time though they reinvested almost everything for the last 10 years into building the commercial software (Foundry). That side of the business has only been live for a VERY short time and initially they literally didn't spend a single dollar on marketing their first commercial clients sought THEM out because of their insane reputation with the government. Foundry helps with supply chains and all kinds of other important data  insights. But if you want a recent example the NIH and the NHS both used Foundry to figure out how to best distribute the vaccine and vaccine distribution in the US and Britain has far outpaced expectations. You think commercial companies aren't going to be interested in using the software that was literally proven on a level like that?

 They're only just now adding huge amounts of people to their sales teams literally in the last six months which if you read Peter thiels book is insane for the stock because they have this crazy long term plan and he literally talks about how when they get to a certain point and start adding sales as a full sector of the company it means that is the company the company plans to BEGIN scaling. Meaning they're this big and they literally only just started on the scaling part. Which they've also said in tons of interviews if you're a die hard Palantirian like me. 



They actually also have the third side of the  business which is their actual like full AI for weaponization and war and defense for the government. Gotham is like helping analysts and commanders lead and even helping police or agents figure out what's going on. This other software is different. It's called Apollo and its only at the beginning too. It's like pure AI machine learning AI handles everything stuff. Go find a video called pentagon head of NSC briefs public on AI I think it's on the PBS channel on YouTube or some shit. Or you can listen to Joe Biden talk about how we're going to double our percentage of gdp spending on AI. The amount of government money that's going to go into AI as a weapon to compete with China DWARFS peoples expectations of how much large the market for the kind of software palantir makes is. 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201001005334/en/U.S.-Army-Research-Lab-Selects-Palantir-Technologies-Inc.-for-91M-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-Development

This is literally the backbone of everything AI that the government is about to invest in. Sure they're going to experiment with other research but if you do research you'll also find Palantir is the ONLY company that does anything remotely like this software that has anywhere near the kind of clearances like what is required for these contracts. They are currently a clearance level 5 and about to be the highest 6. The closest competitors are almost all a 3 or lower I'm not even sure if there's more than a single 4 and that stuff is crazy hard to get. 

But like again I'm an obsessive. I realize why people get so excited about the commercial side scaling and how it's very possible and can make them huge and it will. But I'm actually pretty sure the reason people like Cathy Wood has such a huge boner for them is that she realizes how MASSIVELY. And I mean MASSIVELY underestimated the amount of government revenue they will get from all this AI investing the United States and NATO are about to do. It's literally the next Manhattan project and they're absolutely going to be one of the biggest players developing it if not the biggest. I think it's funny because most people are pretty disinterested in the government stuff for Palantir but i really think the weaponized AI apollo stuff may be as big as anything could ever be. 




Also people got the insider selling stuff very very wrong. Tom Nash (love him or hate him I don't care) has a few really good recent videos where he explains it in basically full detail what was happening. The selling panicked a lot of retail investors during a time when the buying for growth markets had really slowed because of rate hike due to inflation scares and a ton of retail holders got scared and caused more selling and more people got scared because of that and sold and it really just was mass psychology in effect and a LOT of FUD and confusion. 

Basically a few executives karp in particular got billions of dollars worth of options that vest but literally expire so you have to exercise them which means you buy shares of the company at a strike price. Well because it's the company granting shares the strike price is literally 10 cents or something and these automatically have to vest at quarterly increments. So everytime karp was exercising he's actually buying shares. Like over 150 million in total maybe a lot more million SHARES not dollars. shares. And even those when he exercising he's buying shares technically from the company it ALL counts as profit on taxes and ITS NOT LONG TERM CAP GAINS ELIGIBLE. So over the last year plus this year he's essentially getting shares but the literal dollar value of those shares to the government counts as pure profit. So his total income which he's getting taxed at 40% of is in the BILLIONS yes billions. Because that's a lot to handle people that work for them actually automatically schedule sells of shares to cover the taxes so that there's no issue it's not even like him saying sell today and they do this.... TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INSIDER SELLING TO THE SEC. That's why it's automatically happening so no one can ever claim he's timing it. 

So listen cause here's where it gets important. The exercising of the shares counts as almost pure profits but remember he's receiving SHARES not dollars he doesn't actually get billions of dollars. So has to then sell SOME of the shares so he can pays taxes on that. Then when he sells the shares to pay the taxes for exercising he actually owes even more money if they went up from when he exercised. So everytime he's selling low its actually good for him because it's less ADDITIONAL PROFIT that he would owe taxes on.

 If he wasn't selling its because he thought it would go down even further and then he would actually owe less taxes overall. So if he thought it was going to tank he'd wait and actually get a nice fat discount on his taxes. 

I know this seems really crazy but I promise that's how it works you can look it up in detail but yeah shocking that mainstream media and redditors/youtubers who barely do research and have no real understanding of how these billion dollar compensations work would get it wrong. Unbelievable I know. If he had actually sold the massive overall percentage of his shares that some people claim he did the company would be at like $3-6 dollars not low 20s. Retail got confused because of market pressured due to interest rate fears from inflation and sold low (like retail always does) to institutions.",nmofz4,"Palantir DD if you want to understand company and it's history better (also insider ""selling"" explained in detail)"

What is Blue Apron?


Blue Apron (NYSE: APRN) was the forgotten step child, bad luck Brian, IPO of summer 2017 that priced below range and had the misfortune of debuting after Amazon bought Whole Foods. Since it‚Äôs debut, the stock has suffered dropping from nearly $150 per share (adjusted for a 2019 reverse-split necessitated to stay listed) to as low as approximately $2.00!


Why the Drop?


Management. Fucking. Sucked. The prior executive team essentially handed Chad Hello Fresh the keys to the kingdom, when they made the fatal error of betting that the ‚Äúhigh affinity core users‚Äù would be enough to sustain the business. For this reason, they cut marketing to nearly nothing and attempted to realize operating leverage by shrinking the customer base only to its most prolific buyers.

This was stupid. HelloFresh did the opposite, essentially giving away meals, and they used it to stockpile market share. Put a chart up of HelloFresh customers against Blue Apron. You‚Äôll see the two lines converge and a clear indication that HelloFresh stole most of their business. HelloFresh was one of the best trades of the past 5 years. Look at the chart, look at the sales, and look at the margins. They have managed to achieve operating leverage by employing affordable pricing and emphasizing retention.


Blue Apron Might Go Under....


Today the company is in a dire place. Languishing away in Micro Cap hell at an $80M market cap, no one on Wall Street wants to cover these guys. Only their bankers, CG and MS, write them research and neither are overly optimistic. They‚Äôre in a shit spot with a credit line that mandates they keep $15M cash at all times, and they keep their customer base above 300K (thus far, they‚Äôve struggled). They‚Äôre sitting on $29M and burn enough cash per Q that they might go below that $15M level (wouldn‚Äôt be a first). All signs are negative...


But I Think They Might Win


Blue Apron is under new management. Linda Kozlowski, is the former COO of ETSY and an ex-strategist at Alibaba. She believes HelloFresh did things right and she wants to right the ship. Her ballsy-ass plan is to ride the line on cash and go all in on customer growth. She realizes those customers are worth a lot more than income on the P&L, and that she needs to make the pot as big as she can. Thus far, it‚Äôs worked. Customers are up over 20% in the past two periods and retention rates are rising. We are seeing signs of operating leverage, and it opens a big possibility.


My Prediction

Management is buying shares. They know the company is not healthy. The only logic is that they have a plan that‚Äôs working. You can‚Äôt sell a dying business with a shrinking share, but you can certainly sell a growing community, that could be an accretive asset to a better capitalized entity. I think Linda is going either get the business in a position where it can refinance for better terms, or where it can be sold to create shareholder value via a strategic alternative.

If that happen, given this is priced for bankruptcy and ignored by the Street, the returns could easily reach the triple digits. I‚Äôm long and I plan to add on additional weakness.

Everyone is talking about how the squeeze didn't even happen and the shorts didn't cover yet. What I don't understand is why wouldn't that be possible? If short interest is 17%, so let's round up to about 100M shares. Today the volume traded was 700M shares. Couldn't 100M of those 700M have been the shorts covering? And if they didn't cover, today alone 700M shares were traded, why would 100M shares bought by shorts cause a squeeze if today 700M were traded?

I have been having this question for awhile, since I noticed the same with GME. In the days preceding January 28th (when GME reached its peak), the combined volume was several times the amount of float. How come the squeeze happened and why did it happen? If the volume was so high, couldn't the shorts have covered in the days preceding that?

The plan includes creating an online ticketing platform by Great British Railways which might have a huge blow on Trainline revenue. However, this platform does not yet exist and will probably take a couple of years to develop. Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed.

In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales.  Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%.

I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time  for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

5925,,2021-05-28 10:41:01,t3_nmuzzi,,wallstreetbets,"Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent of Modernas if not more. Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects) 

Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

Imagine if the spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize one piece to understand the whole picture it and helps modify your DNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates it can still recognize the virus. In contrast to using one portion of the picture as it mutates it's easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine, that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. Not only that but they have had the least amount of side effects of any covid vaccine deeming it the safest covid vaccine.... 

And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein (whole picture) and the safety profile. Also worth a mention is that you could store it in a regular refrigerator, and let it sit out in room temperature while you're vaccinating people instead of a special ultra low temp freeze needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers, this is a majority of the world. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines so other protein competitors will be far behind and they will have an a moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing they teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine. They will be combining flu and covid vaccine by 2025 for possibly double the price of current covid vaccine.

 They are pretty much de-risked at this point. Yes you could buy other  biotechs that can go up 20x but are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up) that has all successful trials done so far, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment to where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place there are no more glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""

They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. Yesterday at market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. 
 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

Future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract in there ( in the link below in another message). It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 

I own some $200 July calls along with about 933 shares. I'm all in baby.  Been in since $3.84 I sold once during February a couple months back and got back in a bit too early but I'm diamond hands all the way to $800 from here.  LFG I expect to turn that into over a cool million in a year's time via shares and options

Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. This is huge as the combo is going to differentiate them especially since both flu and covid vaccines are first in class.

 And I've included a couple messages down below explaining more in detail about what I talked about in case there's any questions.

# SPY SG:

Looks like low volatility day. Play tight.

Note from SG: ""For todays expiration our models show about 15% SPX /30% SPY gamma expiring, which could allow volatility increase a bit into next week. This in turn may free markets for a push up into that 4250 target (Call Wall) area.""

Gamma Index: decreased to -0.1 (A large negative figure indicates volatility may be high. The range is from 4 to ‚Äì4.)

Vol Trigger: Increased to 419 (Important support and resistance level. (above this level = lower volatility and a more stable stock price.)

Abs Gamma Strike: Unchanged

Gamma Notional: Decreased to $-516 (stock has larger put gamma position. A negative gamma position implies higher volatility in the underlying)

Put Wall Support: Increased to 419 (If Put Wall shifts to a higher strike it could be a bearish indication)

Call Wall Strike: Increased to 425 (When this strike is rolled higher it is generally considered bullish)

Gamma Tilt: Decreased to 0.88	 (when decreasing it‚Äôs a bearish signal.)

Net Delta: Increased to 198k (positive delta position infers options market makers have a net long hedge.)

25d risk reversal: Increased to -0.06 (When the ratio shifts towards 0 it indicates call demand)

Topp Abs Gamma Strikes: 	\[420, 419, 418, 415\]

1) We look to the PTON CFO's statement found in the latest earnings call transcript, for guidance:
""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior.""
2) Being that we do not have access to a 10-K filing for Q4 fiscal '19, we will access other filings that do in fact reference numbers from fiscal '19...
A) 10-K filing dated 9/11/2020
B) 10-Q filing dated 5/6/2020
3) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $223.3M under Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19)
But, that is TOTAL Revenue; we need to find out what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike sales...
4) To calculate what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike Sales, we can use numbers from neighboring Q3 (i.e. Three Months Ended March 31, 2019)...
A) On page 6 of the 10-Q, you will find Revenue of ""Connected Fitness Products"" (aka Bike Sales) to be $261.6M
B) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $316.7M
C) % of Bike Sales per TOTAL Revenue: $261.6M / $316.7M * 100 = 82.6% {""Connected Fitness Products"" Revenue (aka Bike Sales)}
5) Apply 82.6% to the TOTAL Revenue $223.3M for Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19): $223.3M x 0.826 = $184.45M {Bike Sales for Q4 of fiscal '19}
6) Per the CFO, ""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior."":

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote... By mid-July, we‚Äôll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase precious metals  especially silver amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative 

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

Gold rose over 60% in the 1930s as the prices of stocks and real estate crashed. You could buy an entire block with a one ounce gold coin. Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms.

I must address Cramer's statement because he is obviously trying to add fuel to the short-selling fire: When he says ""we're not going natural gas"" he is clearly making a vague and general statement meant to be interpreted in the worst possible way: ""no one is going to buy or use natural gas."" By now, I hope everyone that is interested in this stock understands that CLNE offers an alternative transportation fuel, thus, the investments made by BP and Chevron, and not revolutionary technology like some EV's (but this is mostly hype meant to catapult EVs to the front. What most people do not realize is that driverless technology and such can be placed in Petro vehicles too). Also, unfortunately, the company has done a terrible marketting job. That's why powerful analysts can get away with making vague and unsupported statements. The fact that Cramer explained the stock's decrease over the last month as being due to widespread dissaproval is misleading, at best. Many people do not yet know about the cleanliness and therapeutic effects RNG has on the climate.

The News...

If you haven't read yet it looks like Federal Cannabis legalization my be around the corner. [Here](https://www.mpp.org/policy/federal/the-more-act/) is the House Bill. Supporters seem on board and like the reforms they have done to the bill including rescheduling cannabis. [Last time](https://mjbizdaily.com/key-us-house-lawmaker-reintroduces-federal-marijuana-legalization-bill/) the bill was introduced it cleared the House.   


Personally I think this gets a lot of support especially from a fiscal point of view. With stimulus stalling and a giant debate going on about how to pay for the stimulus I think cannabis offers the easiest way to collect federal revenue. A simple review of the bill and the fiscal benefits to the Fed's can be read [here](https://www.justtherealnews.com/congress/nadler-blumenauer-lee-jackson-lee-jeffries-velazquez-reintroduce-comprehensive-marijuana-reform-legislation/). The bill states a 5% fed tax. Money coming for uncle Sam, right when questions about paying for stimulus.... Personally I think it adds up, but that's for you to decide. 

Okay so that's the hype...

Let's talk about the tickers listed ($SNDL and $TLRY).

I'll start with the cheaper YOLO, $SNDL. $SNDL short interest isn't high, but the company did issue convertible notes a while back around .7c if my memory is correct. I'm not saying they won't do it again, but they should be in a good place fiscally for now. Float is high with about 1.6B shares out there. However today's volume at the time of writing is over 415M. That's not bad given such a high float. It's about 200% more than the average volume. 

The options chain on $SNDL has me giddy. With over 200,000 options currently in the money on todays move above $1 there is some high potential here for some interesting action. The put to call ratio is just obnoxiously low at .08 it's screaming upwards betting. If we hold above $1 the potential squeeze up could be amazing.   


It's also broken up on the trend lines and out of the downward channel it was in. The regression channel from the peak squeeze back in Feb just broke out today according to my crayons I have laying around. 

$TLRY

$TLRY was the squeeze of a lifetime if you remember it back in 19'. The ticker was just a money printer with it's low float and stupid hype. Then they proceeded to do, like they all do, and issue debt. Shares tumbled since then falling from $120 --> $5. Ouch bag holders.   


Like all the cannabis stocks the Feb bump pushed $TLRY to above $60 in an amazing move. $TLRY has a lower short interest than $SNDL, but it also has a much lower float at about 300M. Compared to $SNDL the volume here isn't as good, but still remains decently above the avg volume around 36M as of right now. 

If we peep the options chain we also see a crazy low P/C ratio around .11. But we don't have the Open Interest in the chain like $SNDL does unless you roll out to Jun 18. Then we finally get some decent OI.   


Personally I am going with $SNDL. The option's chain looks better, the stock is cheaper, and the short interest is a little better. My advice would be to roll out till at least the Jun 11th $1 strike to not get eaten alive by Theta and IV crush. But WSB does what WSB wants and that's why I love you all.   
Do not go above the $2 strikes IMO. You will get crushed by theta unless we get an insane move, which could happen but I don't see the risk / reward there.",nn326f,MORE ACT / CANNABIS / $SNDL & $TLRY Potential

>A corner in the silver market has been tried before - and let's be clear, that is what is being attempted now.  In 1980, a rule change by the government destroyed the corner.  #silverthursday.

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday

>Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers‚Äô attempt to corner the market on the metal.

-
>Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926‚Äì2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers‚Äô Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.

-
>By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged‚ÄîMarch 27‚Äîsilver fell to $10.80, the metal‚Äôs biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, ‚ÄúA billion dollars isn‚Äôt what it used to be,‚Äù the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.

-
>To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978‚Äì91) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities.",nn36fw,There is no silver short squeeze happening.

Tl;dr

This is an extensive, in-depth due-diligence document, and I realize that ‚Äúain‚Äôt nobody got time for that‚Äù. So I have decided to do God‚Äôs work for him and put the tl;dr at the start, saving you all a couple hours read.

* Henrik Fisker is a God among men in the automotive industry - trust him to do right
* Geeta Gupta-Fisker is a solid Chief Financial Officer with experience in investment banking - she will ensure the shares are valued right
* Henrik has learned from all the mistakes he made with his previous attempt to create Fisker Automotive, and will certainly do everything in his power to avoid that mess again. He has designed systems into the intricacies of the company to avoid failure - meaning Fisker Inc is guaranteed to succeed
* Henrik Fisker on shorting $FSR - ‚ÄúYou will quickly understand that you stand to lose a lot of money if you show it against Fisker‚Äù
* Production of Fisker Ocean expected to start in November 2022
* 250,000+ units a year expected by 2025
* Partnerships with Foxconn and Magna Steyr, both giants in their respective industries, among others
* Large Fleet market in Europe gaining momentum, and 700+ Fisker reservations in this market alone
* 16,000+ reservations already. More than Tesla had 18 months pre-production
* Revenue streams include leasing automotives, servicing, selling emissions credits, selling insurance (like selling the pickaxe to miners, and selling the diamonds to the mine owners too, absolutely genius - Fisker are insuring cars which they own, because the customer is only leasing it)
* High short interest (20%+), high analyst price targets compared to current share price (100%+) and low valuation compared to peers ($3bn market cap currently)
* Designing the first ever all-electric popemobile - Massive, soon to be historic, event!
* I give $FSR (currently $13 a share) a price target of $100 by end of year 2022, if not sooner
* Price Targets: $35 by end of year - Previous ATH. $50 start of next year - European and Chinese debut of prototypes. $100 end of 2022 - start of production (SOP). $150+ 2023
* 2025 Price Targets, calculated using projected data: Bear case - $97 a share, Bull case - $519 a share
* Downside in the short term is capped by the large amount of cash on hand - one third of market cap is cash. Long term, is capped by risk factors, which are almost eligible and affect every automotive startup anyway.

In 2007, Tesla Motors hired Henrik Fisker to perform initial design work on the Tesla Model S electric sedan, which was introduced in 2012.

Fisker stated in 2018 that, with the growth of car-sharing, ride-hailing, and autonomous shuttles, he believes within 10 years private cars will be used for less than half of what they are currently used for.

## Fisker Automotive

In 2008, Fisker Automotive raised over $90 million from investors including venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. In September 2009, Fisker Automotive was awarded a $528 million loan guarantee by the United States Department of Energy (DOE). The automaker was one of four recipients of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, to encourage the domestic manufacture of electric cars. The funds were to be used to develop the Karma, as well as an affordable family-size plug-in hybrid car. The loan facility was frozen at $192 million in February 2012, after the DOE claimed that Fisker missed its milestones

In December 2011, just as the Fisker Karma was launched, its battery supplier, A123 Systems, recalled all batteries, followed by a second recall in 2012. A123 filed for bankruptcy in October 2012, leaving Fisker Automotive without a battery supplier. After selling approximately 2,000 units, production of the Fisker Karma was suspended in November 2012, in the absence of its battery supplier.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/59vfj5wa8w171.png?width=511&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1c03d1e1254fea00c195776122de2b26099dd35

Henrik Fisker resigned as chairman from Fisker Automotive in March 2013, because of disagreements with management about business strategy. Later that year, the company declared voluntary bankruptcy.Fisker raised and spent more than a billion dollars over its lifetime.The heart of Fisker‚Äôs business model was in that early deal with Quantum. The idea was to design a gorgeous car, and have suppliers like Quantum provide the technology because off-the-shelf parts from suppliers would help keep costs down.

But there were problems with this strategy: Sometimes, those parts had to be custom-made to fit the design vision, which resulted in higher prices for Fisker. Other times, parts were delivered late or, worse, faulty, but Fisker was locked in to those supplier relationships. Sources close to Fisker have also said that many of the parts were owned by the suppliers themselves, so Fisker didn‚Äôt own a lot of the internal technology.

The broker that raised funds for Fisker automotive, by selling their private shares, was Advanced Equities.It wasn‚Äôt until December 2011 and into 2012 that the more dubious efforts of Advanced Equities became clearer to Fisker‚Äôs hundreds of investors. The last few hundred million dollars of Advanced Equities‚Äô fund raising for Fisker, starting with the D-1 round, was what brokers call ‚Äúpay to play.‚Äù As Fisker was running into technical, delivery and political problems, its valuation was quickly declining. But the company still needed more money, so the brokers went back to its current investors and said: Unless you give this more, your current shares will be diluted and your preferred stock will be converted to common stock.

It was essentially a gun to their heads. This is why investor Wray sued Fisker in February 2012, alleging he was on the receiving end of this tactic. In his lawsuit, he says Advanced Equities sent him a letter dated Jan. 18, 2012, stating that he needed to decide if he wanted to invest in Fisker‚Äôs next round, and pay around $84,000 by Jan. 27, 2012 ‚Äî a little over a week from receiving the letter. He also says that Advanced Equities assured him that he would have anti-dilution protection. According to the audio clip from Advanced Equities‚Äô internal sales call in early 2010, Advanced Equity leaders say that the Fisker deal will ‚Äúsuffer no dilution,‚Äù and was ‚Äúa dream scenario.‚Äù

That dream would soon end. In September 2012 after Fisker closed on $1.2 billion in funding, the bulk of it organized by Advanced Equities, the SEC charged the broker with misleading investors when it raised money for another company back in 2009 and 2010 (Bloom Energy). Advanced settled, agreeing to pay $1 million, and its co-founders were personally fined. Two months later Advanced Equities closed up shop.

Later, A123 Systems itself went bankrupt, causing more problems for Fisker. Fisker claimed that A123 Systems owed it $140 million, but a bankruptcy settlement reduced that to a paltry $15 million.

Then there was the just plain terrible luck for the ironically named Karma: Super Storm Sandy wiped out 338 of its Karmas in storage in New Jersey. The cars first drowned, and then caught on fire ‚Äî salt water damage caused a short circuit that was spread to other cars by high winds, Fisker said at the time.

With all of this happening in public ‚Äî and in a presidential election year ‚Äî Fisker‚Äôs struggles became highly politicized. The company was mentioned numerous times in presidential debates and speeches leading up to the election. Republican nominee Romney called Fisker and other DOE-supported companies losers.

The company didn‚Äôt seem to invest substantially in technology innovation or tech IP, and seemed to spend a disproportionate amount on suppliers. For example, numerous sources have said that the company paid upfront for 15,000 of some of the parts for its planned 15,000 Karmas. It ended up only selling around 2,000 of the cars. It has also been said that Fisker paid some funds upfront to have BMW make engines for the 100,000 Nina cars it hoped to produce ‚Äî in the end, Fisker didn‚Äôt deliver a single Nina.

Costs to build each Karma also creeped up because the company missed its volume targets, and because engineering had to change designs around supplier constraints. The company ended up adding $20,000 to its initial sale price.

Expensive hires may also have sucked away chunks of Fisker‚Äôs funding: Sources say that Fisker filled the upper levels of the company with seasoned auto executives from Detroit. At the high point of Fisker, the company had around 300 employees, plus dozens of contract staff. Bringing in a certain amount of the old guard could help a car startup ramp up quickly, and also impress potential investors with ‚Äúindustry names.‚Äù But those people are also used to big auto-industry budgets that included extensive travel and salaries ‚Äî that‚Äôs the opposite life of a tech startup.

## Fisker Inc.

In July 2016, Henrik Fisker expressed interest in designing a fully connected electric car with autonomous driving features and an aesthetically pleasing look. He has pursued battery technology, and hinted at potentially reviving the Fisker name with a pure-electric vehicle using technology that nobody else has. Since then Fisker has talked about delays to the promised solid state battery technology, which he does not expect to be able to be produced in volume until at least 2025. Posing risk for competition from more scientifically experienced future solid state battery producers such as Quantumscape.

***Forbes:*** ‚ÄúNow he‚Äôs back‚Äìand three things are different. First and foremost, he has a vital new partner: his wife, cofounder and Fisker Inc. CFO Geeta Gupta-Fisker. Second, his Los Angeles-based company is public this time around, raising more than $1 billion in an October 2020 IPO. And finally, Fisker‚Äôs stock price, up 56% since its debut, has made both Henrik and Geeta billionaires, each worth about $1.1 billion as of Friday‚Äôs market close. The auto industry has seen father-son and sibling leadership teams, but Fisker Inc.‚Äôs CEO-CFO combo is the fast-changing sector‚Äôs first husband and wife power couple.‚Äù

Wealth isn‚Äôt the purpose of the new company, Henrik says. ‚ÄúI never got into cars because of money. (This shows he is willing to do what is in the best interest of the company because he is not motivated by money, unlike 99% of other CEO‚Äôs)

The couple sought a big stake in the new venture to ensure they can control its fate in a way Fisker couldn‚Äôt with his earlier company.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yzhded6pfw171.png?width=408&format=png&auto=webp&s=54b30259720cf853a8efeacf058f2f74315260b9

Henrik is an auto industry celebrity, but Geeta‚Äôs background is equally impressive. A native of India, she holds multiple degrees in science, including a Ph.D. in biotechnology from Cambridge University where she was also a Research Newton Fellow. From there, she started a career in international investment for Lloyds Banking Group, and then managed investments for a high-net-worth client for several years. (In particular, this is insanely important - Geeta **KNOWS MONEY**! She knows how best to keep a company afloat, organize its share structure, provide value to shareholders, etc. because she has worked in the industry before. She may just be the most important element of Fisker Inc., due to the financial experience she has. At every step of the way, she is likely to make decisions with one sole focus - increasing share price and value).

She met her future husband in 2011 when he was visiting London, just before things started going very wrong at Fisker Automotive. They married in 2012.

‚ÄúWhen I left Fisker Automotive, all I had was my car,‚Äù Henrik remembers. ‚ÄúI'm in a different position, mainly because of Geeta. Because she cuts the deals.‚Äù

To get the new venture off the ground, the Fiskers invested the majority of their life savings‚Äìan enormous financial risk given the fate of Henrik‚Äôs prior company. Then, just as they were locking in plans for the IPO back in July, they were hit by a highly unwelcome complication: Geeta learned she had early-stage breast cancer.

‚ÄúShe got the call (from her doctor) during a call with investors,‚Äù Henrik says. Despite that bombshell, she continued working with banks and investors in the weeks that followed, even as she underwent two surgical procedures and radiation therapy. Her medical therapy concluded in November.

Henrik, who marvels at her fortitude throughout the health crisis says, ‚Äúshe only missed something like one day of work...That's just how she is. She works tirelessly.‚Äù

## Fisker Ocean

The Fisker Ocean will have a nearly 300-mile range with an 80 kWh battery and a solar panel roof as a range extender, adding approximately 1,000 free miles of range per year. Advanced electronics will be housed under the hood, and the vehicle will incorporate recycled and sustainable materials throughout. Deliveries of the Ocean are scheduled to begin in 2022.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s87j6bdsfw171.png?width=438&format=png&auto=webp&s=e40add9ce53319d31db242cce73a303afb03cbab

Fisker has also announced a partnership with Electrify America to ensure Fisker Ocean vehicles will integrate seamlessly with Electrify America charging stations when the e-SUV hits the market. With features such as a solar roof and recycled inner materials, it will be, according to Fisker Inc., the ""world's most sustainable vehicle.""

In 2017, Fisker Inc. announced that it had filed patents on flexible solid-state battery designs. Fisker expected the batteries to be produced on a mass scale around 2020. A prototype of the battery debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018. In October 2018, Fisker announced new funding for battery development through Caterpillar Venture Capital. The solid-state batteries are intended to deliver longer vehicle range and faster charging times.

In 2018, Fisker was named to the board of directors of First Cobalt, a North American cobalt refinery that produces battery materials.

In September 2019, it was announced that Fisker Inc. was partnering with Game of Thrones actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who will serve as a partner and sustainability adviser to Fisker, to work on advanced, affordable, electric mobility models.

&#x200B;

[In addition to being a well-known actor, Coster-Waldau is also the United Nations Development Program Goodwill Ambassador for climate change and other social issues.](https://preview.redd.it/3hssff5vfw171.png?width=451&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebe55e2468c5b63d1bc0ac3c71547219dff5afaa)

Nikolaj wrote this piece about Fisker:

To quote a friend of mine who is a lot smarter than me, architect Bjarke Ingels: ‚ÄúThe idea that sustainability needs to sacrifice quality of life is a flawed one. It‚Äôs a design challenge, a challenge to build something that transforms the idea of sustainability into something that will increase the quality of life for all those around it.‚Äù

One person meeting that challenge is Henrik Fisker, who has designed some of the most iconic cars over the past decades for BMW and others, like the BMW Z8, Aston Martin DB9 and Aston Martin V8 Vantage. He‚Äôs a hero for gas-guzzling supercars. He is a fellow Dane, I am a fan, and we met, of all places, on Twitter.

When we met in person, he described his new project ‚Äî an all-electric luxury SUV ‚Äî and asked me if I would help spread the word on his car. The problem as I see it with most electric cars is that they only accomplish the basics. They get you from point A to B. They run electric so you don‚Äôt pollute while driving, but that‚Äôs it. They are basically unattractive combustion engine cars that have a battery thrown into them ‚Äî and for most of them, a battery with a limited range. What Fisker does is to try to make every part of the car in a sustainable and attractive way, like a full-length solar roof, recycled floor mats and vegan leather seats. It looks incredibly cool and inviting, with a great 250- to 300-mile range, and at a cost of just under $40,000, it‚Äôs a luxury car affordable to a mass market.

I said yes and even became an investor, not only because it‚Äôs a great car but more importantly, I hope and believe it can inspire other companies to actively incorporate sustainability goals into all aspects of their business. Fisker then had the idea of calling me ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù adviser. Which I am not. Just to be clear. Thanks Henrik, sounds cool, but I am an actor and a citizen, and that‚Äôs really it.

And what about Hollywood? Is our industry changing, are we at the forefront? Looking at social media, you would think so. And things are happening, but usually only when a camera is pointed at people. Remember a few years back when all awards shows only used EVs for the red carpet? We made a difference. We mattered. We showed the way. So cool. So green, so ‚Ä¶ brief. Now it‚Äôs back to the Escalade. But hey, we are not using plastic straws anymore!

To believe that change will come from Hollywood is not really based in reality (when did that stop us?), but we are great at reacting ‚Äî and things around us are changing, and changing us. I have a good friend who loves his SUV. It‚Äôs not electric. But he cannot give up his car. He is a good guy, he‚Äôs works for the U.N., so if he has a problem going electric, we all do. But if he is presented with an alternative that doesn‚Äôt mean a reduction in his quality of life, something like the Fisker SUV, I think he‚Äôd transition to electric in a heartbeat.

The IPO deal values Fisker Inc at US$2.9 billion, with an IPO share price of $10.

On July 30, 2020, Fisker announced plans for a four-vehicle portfolio by 2025. The Fisker Ocean SUV will be joined by a sports sedan based on their previously announced Fisker Emotion concept, a coupe-like SUV, and a lifestyle pickup truck. All will be electric vehicles.

On October 15, 2020, Fisker Inc announced it would be outsourcing vehicle production of its Fisker Ocean electric SUV to Magna Steyr, to reduce the complexities and costs related to the building and operating its own factory. Magna will start building the Fisker Ocean in Europe in 2022.

## Henrik Fisker Interview quotes:

I have people on Twitter saying, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just make the car next month? You have a prototype.‚Äù Most people don‚Äôt understand that it takes 18 months to do long-lead body tooling for high-volume vehicles. Most people don‚Äôt understand it takes two years to do durability tests and do all the engineering certification and everything else.

And on the business model itself, I believe that there is nobody in the near future or the next couple of years that‚Äôs going to make a million EVs on one model. Today, there‚Äôs nobody doing it. Tesla probably has the highest volume of one single model, a couple hundred thousand. But even the big giant established carmakers are not making, right now, a couple hundred thousand vehicles of one model. So the way you get volume, in my view, is if you partner up with other OEMs and share some of the expensive parts of the platform, which in my view is not anymore something that is unique IP or something that is a unique experience to the customer. An aluminum stamped floor or a steel stamped floor really doesn‚Äôt have any brand value anymore.

And obviously, as we move forward, we always start to do some of the things ourselves. But it was really about de-risking in our first vehicle to market. So we‚Äôre going to do another three vehicles, which we can do because we don‚Äôt have to spend all our money and effort on learning how to manufacture a car, for instance.

So we have programmed a lot. We have hired a head of ESG, environmental and social governance, and he is really spearheading developing specific... we kind of put out some goals that we would like to reach with suppliers, and we at least try to bring them in that direction. They are not reaching those goals right now, but they may reach them later. And then we have goals for ourselves. So for instance, we look at transport. Are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs closer to the plant, or are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs on the other side of the planet that way we have to then transport all that stuff. So those are the types of things that we‚Äôre really thinking about now as we‚Äôre nominating suppliers. And finally, materials as well, looking at sustainable materials. We‚Äôve actually picked up a lot of knowledge on that side as well, where we are adding more sustainable materials to our vehicle. So we are actually looking across everything ‚Äî supply chain, where the suppliers are located, what the suppliers are doing for sustainability, and also then of course in the vehicle itself ‚Äî in terms of the type of materials there.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nb8ozukrpw171.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd5a515f831dedcc57b25d717c5c133c0c74299d

So - let's summarize - prices are rising at their fastest pace in almost 30 years and incomes just plunged by their most ever! We're gonna need more stimmies!""  

Plus  to above; 

Last year, Hirschman Capital noted that since 1821, 98% of sovereigns that hit 130% debt/GDP have defaulted on their sovereign debt.   

The US hit 130% late last year. 

Simple Conclussion : The Fed can‚Äôt go ‚Äúhawkish‚Äù and raise rates without sending markets ‚Äìand economies‚Äìto their knees; by extension, they now have nothing left to ‚Äúcut‚Äù when the current everything bubble implodes.

And that  is a *real problem*.

 There are only two ways for sovereigns to default: 

Inflation or collapse.    

The latter is not an option. 

 As for a solution, what‚Äôs so tragic is that the only option before the Fed is an even bigger problem‚Äîcurrent and inevitably more inflation. 

 That is, if the Fed wants to keep markets (and their job security) breathing, they no longer have the foregoing template of ‚Äúrate-hike-followed-by-rate-cutting‚Äù at their disposal, which means they now have no choice but to dovishly keep rates near the zero-bound indefinitely.

But the only way to keep rates ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù and nailed to the floor of time is to purchase otherwise unwanted bonds to keep their prices elevated and hence yields and rates repressed.

Such bond ‚Äúaccommodation,‚Äù of course, costs money, and as we already know, the only ‚Äúmoney‚Äù the Fed has to spend is the kind they create out of thin air‚Äì the very kind of money (and policy) which leads to the kind of inflation discussed above‚Äînamely, the brutal kind.

 As for that fake money, the evidence of the Fed‚Äôs desperate (and only) direction is now obvious, as the following M2 money supply makes equally clear. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v774ta55sw171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e73c839beb67a67eea9aed7de4ac61d86813840

 

Fed is so embarrassed by this ‚Äúprinting solution‚Äù that they‚Äôve stopped *weekly* reporting of M2 data, and frankly, since March, have even stopped *monthly* reporting of the same.

That, of course, is both telling as well as disgraceful‚Ä¶ The Fed literally has something to hide, and that never bodes well, does it?

&#x200B;

 The correlation to central bank balance sheet (i.e., money supply) expansion and rising markets is now beyond dispute. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sgizb6xcsw171.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=aad2fe681fe0c49ac20368aba77e86c118b22959

 In short‚Äîdo you see the correlation and pattern? Do you see how the Fed‚Äôs market sausage is made? More importantly, do you now see the Fed‚Äôs self-made conundrum? 

 

Given that the Fed bows to the markets not the people, which choice do you think they‚Äôll make?

In other words, expect more money printing and more yield curve control‚Äîand hence more money creation, more inflation, and by extension more fiat currency debasement.

 More money supply to keep rates monetized simply means more currency debasement and rising inflation.",nn51ou,"""Fed's ""Favorite"" #Inflation Indicator (PCE) Explodes At Fastest Rate Since 1992 As Incomes Crash By Record"""

I have leading indicators telling me that there are two concurrent shifts underway when it comes to who is purchasing homes.

\- Massive increase in unmarried people buying houses alone. This used to be somewhat unusual, now it's becoming very common.

\- Massive increase in unmarried men, in particular, buying houses alone. Traditionally, the female-to-male ratio of unmarried homebuyers was about 5 to 1. For the last 3 months, it's been closer to 50/50.

Source is my own closed real estate purchase transactions. Am a mortgage broker (btw this means cash purchases are ""invisible"" to me). It takes 3-6 months for [HMDA data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Mortgage_Disclosure_Act) to become accessible to journalists and academics, and thus ""visible"" to the general public (assuming journalists deem it worthy of commenting on), but I can see the trends live in real time.

How would one go about placing a bet that in about 3 or 6 months, the media, journalists, academics, etc, will pick up on this, publish articles, and potentially cause a lot of people to buy certain stocks. Which stocks would that be? Is there a ""Mancave, Inc"" out there that would potentially get an uptick? Or maybe a company making smart-home stuff that is particularly suited to renting by the room (the single men are not buying 1 bedroom condos, they are buying proper houses with 3 bedrooms, etc)?

EDIT: oh, and to be clear. It's not just an uptick in single men. It's an uptick in women too, but a massive surge from the men. It used to be that for 15 banana sales, 10 are to married couples, 4 to single women, and 1 to a single man. Now for the same 15 banana sales, it's 6 to married couples, 6 to single women, and 3 to single men, something like that.",nn76we,Homebuyer Demographics Shift towards single and male. How to bet?

1. Find chart patterns/analysis that works for you. There's like a billion out there, play around with a few

Maybe nothing will ever happen and so be it, missing a few thousands in profits doesnt bother me at all.

What is Blue Apron?


Blue Apron (NYSE: APRN) was the forgotten step child, bad luck Brian, IPO of summer 2017 that priced below range and had the misfortune of debuting after Amazon bought Whole Foods. Since it‚Äôs debut, the stock has suffered dropping from nearly $150 per share (adjusted for a 2019 reverse-split necessitated to stay listed) to as low as approximately $2.00!


Why the Drop?


Management. Fucking. Sucked. The prior executive team essentially handed Chad Hello Fresh the keys to the kingdom, when they made the fatal error of betting that the ‚Äúhigh affinity core users‚Äù would be enough to sustain the business. For this reason, they cut marketing to nearly nothing and attempted to realize operating leverage by shrinking the customer base only to its most prolific buyers.

This was stupid. HelloFresh did the opposite, essentially giving away meals, and they used it to stockpile market share. Put a chart up of HelloFresh customers against Blue Apron. You‚Äôll see the two lines converge and a clear indication that HelloFresh stole most of their business. HelloFresh was one of the best trades of the past 5 years. Look at the chart, look at the sales, and look at the margins. They have managed to achieve operating leverage by employing affordable pricing and emphasizing retention.


Blue Apron Might Go Under....


Today the company is in a dire place. Languishing away in Micro Cap hell at an $80M market cap, no one on Wall Street wants to cover these guys. Only their bankers, CG and MS, write them research and neither are overly optimistic. They‚Äôre in a shit spot with a credit line that mandates they keep $15M cash at all times, and they keep their customer base above 300K (thus far, they‚Äôve struggled). They‚Äôre sitting on $29M and burn enough cash per Q that they might go below that $15M level (wouldn‚Äôt be a first). All signs are negative...


But I Think They Might Win


Blue Apron is under new management. Linda Kozlowski, is the former COO of ETSY and an ex-strategist at Alibaba. She believes HelloFresh did things right and she wants to right the ship. Her ballsy-ass plan is to ride the line on cash and go all in on customer growth. She realizes those customers are worth a lot more than income on the P&L, and that she needs to make the pot as big as she can. Thus far, it‚Äôs worked. Customers are up over 20% in the past two periods and retention rates are rising. We are seeing signs of operating leverage, and it opens a big possibility.


My Prediction

Management is buying shares. They know the company is not healthy. The only logic is that they have a plan that‚Äôs working. You can‚Äôt sell a dying business with a shrinking share, but you can certainly sell a growing community, that could be an accretive asset to a better capitalized entity. I think Linda is going either get the business in a position where it can refinance for better terms, or where it can be sold to create shareholder value via a strategic alternative.

If that happen, given this is priced for bankruptcy and ignored by the Street, the returns could easily reach the triple digits. I‚Äôm long and I plan to add on additional weakness.

Disclosure- I‚Äôm buying a stock that might go under. This is not advice! I‚Äôm stupid.",nmoit0,Blue Apron: Hero or Zero

Everyone is talking about how the squeeze didn't even happen and the shorts didn't cover yet. What I don't understand is why wouldn't that be possible? If short interest is 17%, so let's round up to about 100M shares. Today the volume traded was 700M shares. Couldn't 100M of those 700M have been the shorts covering? And if they didn't cover, today alone 700M shares were traded, why would 100M shares bought by shorts cause a squeeze if today 700M were traded?

I have been having this question for awhile, since I noticed the same with GME. In the days preceding January 28th (when GME reached its peak), the combined volume was several times the amount of float. How come the squeeze happened and why did it happen? If the volume was so high, couldn't the shorts have covered in the days preceding that?

I hope this makes sense and I really hope someone will be kind enough to explain a fellow retard who only knows about crayons what this all means.

Everything looked to have gone off successfully. We are now waiting on the data and craft to be analysed and inspected. This will take a few weeks according to Michael Colglazier.
That being said he had already outlined the test schedule in the earnings zoom call.

1st test flight - may 
2nd crewed flight - June 
3rd flight with R Branson on board late June/July 

4th flight this will be taking the Italian airforce on a training mission (600k a seat) late July


On the run in to the first test flight some possible maintenance issues appeared with the carrier plane White knight 2‚Ä¶. 
This indeed could have gone either way , after 2 weeks inspections it was decided that WK2 did not need to delay testing no maintenance was needed at this point. Scheduled Maintenance will commence in the fall after all tests have been completed.
Upon this news it is my opinion that the testing programme will go ahead as planned.

The market has responded accordingly and the stock is now up from $17-‚Ç¨31

With all these catalysts lined up before the end of the year and commercial operations looming for early 2022 things are looking up for Virgin Galactic.The success of the last test flight the company have now proven tech and concept.

I had a look at $BB and assume that we finally formed the bottom. In the last few days we saw a sharp rise which might continue in the next weeks. If we can break the 12$ resistance, the next targets would be aroung 25-28$. 

Using Elliot wave theory we are probably at the end of the correction wave 4 and now began with the bullish wave 5.

Price targets:

\#1 12$

\#2 25$

6497,,2021-05-28 09:17:32,t3_nmtt43,,wallstreetbets,"Trainline has taken a huge dip since the UK government's announcement of the plan to nationalise the railway network. The plan includes creating an online ticketing platform by Great British Railways which might have a huge blow on Trainline revenue. However, this platform does not yet exist and will probably take a couple of years to develop. Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed.

In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales.  Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%.

I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time  for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

6502,,2021-05-28 10:41:01,t3_nmuzzi,,wallstreetbets,"Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent of Modernas if not more. Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects) 

Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

Imagine if the spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize one piece to understand the whole picture it and helps modify your DNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates it can still recognize the virus. In contrast to using one portion of the picture as it mutates it's easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine, that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. Not only that but they have had the least amount of side effects of any covid vaccine deeming it the safest covid vaccine.... 

And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein (whole picture) and the safety profile. Also worth a mention is that you could store it in a regular refrigerator, and let it sit out in room temperature while you're vaccinating people instead of a special ultra low temp freeze needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers, this is a majority of the world. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines so other protein competitors will be far behind and they will have an a moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing they teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine. They will be combining flu and covid vaccine by 2025 for possibly double the price of current covid vaccine.

 They are pretty much de-risked at this point. Yes you could buy other  biotechs that can go up 20x but are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up) that has all successful trials done so far, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment to where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place there are no more glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""

They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. Yesterday at market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. 
 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

Future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract in there ( in the link below in another message). It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 

I own some $200 July calls along with about 933 shares. I'm all in baby.  Been in since $3.84 I sold once during February a couple months back and got back in a bit too early but I'm diamond hands all the way to $800 from here.  LFG I expect to turn that into over a cool million in a year's time via shares and options

Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. This is huge as the combo is going to differentiate them especially since both flu and covid vaccines are first in class.

""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior.""
2) Being that we do not have access to a 10-K filing for Q4 fiscal '19, we will access other filings that do in fact reference numbers from fiscal '19...

3) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $223.3M under Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19)
But, that is TOTAL Revenue; we need to find out what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike sales...
4) To calculate what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike Sales, we can use numbers from neighboring Q3 (i.e. Three Months Ended March 31, 2019)...
A) On page 6 of the 10-Q, you will find Revenue of ""Connected Fitness Products"" (aka Bike Sales) to be $261.6M
B) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $316.7M
C) % of Bike Sales per TOTAL Revenue: $261.6M / $316.7M * 100 = 82.6% {""Connected Fitness Products"" Revenue (aka Bike Sales)}
5) Apply 82.6% to the TOTAL Revenue $223.3M for Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19): $223.3M x 0.826 = $184.45M {Bike Sales for Q4 of fiscal '19}

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote... By mid-July, we‚Äôll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase precious metals  especially silver amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative 

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

Gold rose over 60% in the 1930s as the prices of stocks and real estate crashed. You could buy an entire block with a one ounce gold coin. Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms.

I must address Cramer's statement because he is obviously trying to add fuel to the short-selling fire: When he says ""we're not going natural gas"" he is clearly making a vague and general statement meant to be interpreted in the worst possible way: ""no one is going to buy or use natural gas."" By now, I hope everyone that is interested in this stock understands that CLNE offers an alternative transportation fuel, thus, the investments made by BP and Chevron, and not revolutionary technology like some EV's (but this is mostly hype meant to catapult EVs to the front. What most people do not realize is that driverless technology and such can be placed in Petro vehicles too). Also, unfortunately, the company has done a terrible marketting job. That's why powerful analysts can get away with making vague and unsupported statements. The fact that Cramer explained the stock's decrease over the last month as being due to widespread dissaproval is misleading, at best. Many people do not yet know about the cleanliness and therapeutic effects RNG has on the climate.

The News...

If you haven't read yet it looks like Federal Cannabis legalization my be around the corner. [Here](https://www.mpp.org/policy/federal/the-more-act/) is the House Bill. Supporters seem on board and like the reforms they have done to the bill including rescheduling cannabis. [Last time](https://mjbizdaily.com/key-us-house-lawmaker-reintroduces-federal-marijuana-legalization-bill/) the bill was introduced it cleared the House.   


Personally I think this gets a lot of support especially from a fiscal point of view. With stimulus stalling and a giant debate going on about how to pay for the stimulus I think cannabis offers the easiest way to collect federal revenue. A simple review of the bill and the fiscal benefits to the Fed's can be read [here](https://www.justtherealnews.com/congress/nadler-blumenauer-lee-jackson-lee-jeffries-velazquez-reintroduce-comprehensive-marijuana-reform-legislation/). The bill states a 5% fed tax. Money coming for uncle Sam, right when questions about paying for stimulus.... Personally I think it adds up, but that's for you to decide. 

Okay so that's the hype...

Let's talk about the tickers listed ($SNDL and $TLRY). 

$SNDL

I'll start with the cheaper YOLO, $SNDL. $SNDL short interest isn't high, but the company did issue convertible notes a while back around .7c if my memory is correct. I'm not saying they won't do it again, but they should be in a good place fiscally for now. Float is high with about 1.6B shares out there. However today's volume at the time of writing is over 415M. That's not bad given such a high float. It's about 200% more than the average volume. 

The options chain on $SNDL has me giddy. With over 200,000 options currently in the money on todays move above $1 there is some high potential here for some interesting action. The put to call ratio is just obnoxiously low at .08 it's screaming upwards betting. If we hold above $1 the potential squeeze up could be amazing.   


It's also broken up on the trend lines and out of the downward channel it was in. The regression channel from the peak squeeze back in Feb just broke out today according to my crayons I have laying around. 

$TLRY

$TLRY was the squeeze of a lifetime if you remember it back in 19'. The ticker was just a money printer with it's low float and stupid hype. Then they proceeded to do, like they all do, and issue debt. Shares tumbled since then falling from $120 --> $5. Ouch bag holders.   


Like all the cannabis stocks the Feb bump pushed $TLRY to above $60 in an amazing move. $TLRY has a lower short interest than $SNDL, but it also has a much lower float at about 300M. Compared to $SNDL the volume here isn't as good, but still remains decently above the avg volume around 36M as of right now. 

If we peep the options chain we also see a crazy low P/C ratio around .11. But we don't have the Open Interest in the chain like $SNDL does unless you roll out to Jun 18. Then we finally get some decent OI.   


Personally I am going with $SNDL. The option's chain looks better, the stock is cheaper, and the short interest is a little better. My advice would be to roll out till at least the Jun 11th $1 strike to not get eaten alive by Theta and IV crush. But WSB does what WSB wants and that's why I love you all.   
Do not go above the $2 strikes IMO. You will get crushed by theta unless we get an insane move, which could happen but I don't see the risk / reward there.",nn326f,MORE ACT / CANNABIS / $SNDL & $TLRY Potential

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday

>Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers‚Äô attempt to corner the market on the metal.

-
>Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926‚Äì2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers‚Äô Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.

-
>By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged‚ÄîMarch 27‚Äîsilver fell to $10.80, the metal‚Äôs biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, ‚ÄúA billion dollars isn‚Äôt what it used to be,‚Äù the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.

-
>To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978‚Äì91) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities.",nn36fw,There is no silver short squeeze happening.

* Geeta Gupta-Fisker is a solid Chief Financial Officer with experience in investment banking - she will ensure the shares are valued right
* Henrik has learned from all the mistakes he made with his previous attempt to create Fisker Automotive, and will certainly do everything in his power to avoid that mess again. He has designed systems into the intricacies of the company to avoid failure - meaning Fisker Inc is guaranteed to succeed

* Large Fleet market in Europe gaining momentum, and 700+ Fisker reservations in this market alone
* 16,000+ reservations already. More than Tesla had 18 months pre-production
* Revenue streams include leasing automotives, servicing, selling emissions credits, selling insurance (like selling the pickaxe to miners, and selling the diamonds to the mine owners too, absolutely genius - Fisker are insuring cars which they own, because the customer is only leasing it)
* High short interest (20%+), high analyst price targets compared to current share price (100%+) and low valuation compared to peers ($3bn market cap currently)
* Designing the first ever all-electric popemobile - Massive, soon to be historic, event!
* I give $FSR (currently $13 a share) a price target of $100 by end of year 2022, if not sooner
* Price Targets: $35 by end of year - Previous ATH. $50 start of next year - European and Chinese debut of prototypes. $100 end of 2022 - start of production (SOP). $150+ 2023
* 2025 Price Targets, calculated using projected data: Bear case - $97 a share, Bull case - $519 a share
* Downside in the short term is capped by the large amount of cash on hand - one third of market cap is cash. Long term, is capped by risk factors, which are almost eligible and affect every automotive startup anyway.

## Fisker Automotive

In 2008, Fisker Automotive raised over $90 million from investors including venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. In September 2009, Fisker Automotive was awarded a $528 million loan guarantee by the United States Department of Energy (DOE). The automaker was one of four recipients of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, to encourage the domestic manufacture of electric cars. The funds were to be used to develop the Karma, as well as an affordable family-size plug-in hybrid car. The loan facility was frozen at $192 million in February 2012, after the DOE claimed that Fisker missed its milestones

In December 2011, just as the Fisker Karma was launched, its battery supplier, A123 Systems, recalled all batteries, followed by a second recall in 2012. A123 filed for bankruptcy in October 2012, leaving Fisker Automotive without a battery supplier. After selling approximately 2,000 units, production of the Fisker Karma was suspended in November 2012, in the absence of its battery supplier.

&#x200B;

Henrik Fisker resigned as chairman from Fisker Automotive in March 2013, because of disagreements with management about business strategy. Later that year, the company declared voluntary bankruptcy.Fisker raised and spent more than a billion dollars over its lifetime.The heart of Fisker‚Äôs business model was in that early deal with Quantum. The idea was to design a gorgeous car, and have suppliers like Quantum provide the technology because off-the-shelf parts from suppliers would help keep costs down.

But there were problems with this strategy: Sometimes, those parts had to be custom-made to fit the design vision, which resulted in higher prices for Fisker. Other times, parts were delivered late or, worse, faulty, but Fisker was locked in to those supplier relationships. Sources close to Fisker have also said that many of the parts were owned by the suppliers themselves, so Fisker didn‚Äôt own a lot of the internal technology.

The broker that raised funds for Fisker automotive, by selling their private shares, was Advanced Equities.It wasn‚Äôt until December 2011 and into 2012 that the more dubious efforts of Advanced Equities became clearer to Fisker‚Äôs hundreds of investors. The last few hundred million dollars of Advanced Equities‚Äô fund raising for Fisker, starting with the D-1 round, was what brokers call ‚Äúpay to play.‚Äù As Fisker was running into technical, delivery and political problems, its valuation was quickly declining. But the company still needed more money, so the brokers went back to its current investors and said: Unless you give this more, your current shares will be diluted and your preferred stock will be converted to common stock.

It was essentially a gun to their heads. This is why investor Wray sued Fisker in February 2012, alleging he was on the receiving end of this tactic. In his lawsuit, he says Advanced Equities sent him a letter dated Jan. 18, 2012, stating that he needed to decide if he wanted to invest in Fisker‚Äôs next round, and pay around $84,000 by Jan. 27, 2012 ‚Äî a little over a week from receiving the letter. He also says that Advanced Equities assured him that he would have anti-dilution protection. According to the audio clip from Advanced Equities‚Äô internal sales call in early 2010, Advanced Equity leaders say that the Fisker deal will ‚Äúsuffer no dilution,‚Äù and was ‚Äúa dream scenario.‚Äù

That dream would soon end. In September 2012 after Fisker closed on $1.2 billion in funding, the bulk of it organized by Advanced Equities, the SEC charged the broker with misleading investors when it raised money for another company back in 2009 and 2010 (Bloom Energy). Advanced settled, agreeing to pay $1 million, and its co-founders were personally fined. Two months later Advanced Equities closed up shop.

Later, A123 Systems itself went bankrupt, causing more problems for Fisker. Fisker claimed that A123 Systems owed it $140 million, but a bankruptcy settlement reduced that to a paltry $15 million.

Then there was the just plain terrible luck for the ironically named Karma: Super Storm Sandy wiped out 338 of its Karmas in storage in New Jersey. The cars first drowned, and then caught on fire ‚Äî salt water damage caused a short circuit that was spread to other cars by high winds, Fisker said at the time.

With all of this happening in public ‚Äî and in a presidential election year ‚Äî Fisker‚Äôs struggles became highly politicized. The company was mentioned numerous times in presidential debates and speeches leading up to the election. Republican nominee Romney called Fisker and other DOE-supported companies losers.

The company didn‚Äôt seem to invest substantially in technology innovation or tech IP, and seemed to spend a disproportionate amount on suppliers. For example, numerous sources have said that the company paid upfront for 15,000 of some of the parts for its planned 15,000 Karmas. It ended up only selling around 2,000 of the cars. It has also been said that Fisker paid some funds upfront to have BMW make engines for the 100,000 Nina cars it hoped to produce ‚Äî in the end, Fisker didn‚Äôt deliver a single Nina.

Costs to build each Karma also creeped up because the company missed its volume targets, and because engineering had to change designs around supplier constraints. The company ended up adding $20,000 to its initial sale price.

Expensive hires may also have sucked away chunks of Fisker‚Äôs funding: Sources say that Fisker filled the upper levels of the company with seasoned auto executives from Detroit. At the high point of Fisker, the company had around 300 employees, plus dozens of contract staff. Bringing in a certain amount of the old guard could help a car startup ramp up quickly, and also impress potential investors with ‚Äúindustry names.‚Äù But those people are also used to big auto-industry budgets that included extensive travel and salaries ‚Äî that‚Äôs the opposite life of a tech startup.

In July 2016, Henrik Fisker expressed interest in designing a fully connected electric car with autonomous driving features and an aesthetically pleasing look. He has pursued battery technology, and hinted at potentially reviving the Fisker name with a pure-electric vehicle using technology that nobody else has. Since then Fisker has talked about delays to the promised solid state battery technology, which he does not expect to be able to be produced in volume until at least 2025. Posing risk for competition from more scientifically experienced future solid state battery producers such as Quantumscape.

***Forbes:*** ‚ÄúNow he‚Äôs back‚Äìand three things are different. First and foremost, he has a vital new partner: his wife, cofounder and Fisker Inc. CFO Geeta Gupta-Fisker. Second, his Los Angeles-based company is public this time around, raising more than $1 billion in an October 2020 IPO. And finally, Fisker‚Äôs stock price, up 56% since its debut, has made both Henrik and Geeta billionaires, each worth about $1.1 billion as of Friday‚Äôs market close. The auto industry has seen father-son and sibling leadership teams, but Fisker Inc.‚Äôs CEO-CFO combo is the fast-changing sector‚Äôs first husband and wife power couple.‚Äù

Wealth isn‚Äôt the purpose of the new company, Henrik says. ‚ÄúI never got into cars because of money. (This shows he is willing to do what is in the best interest of the company because he is not motivated by money, unlike 99% of other CEO‚Äôs)

The couple sought a big stake in the new venture to ensure they can control its fate in a way Fisker couldn‚Äôt with his earlier company.

Henrik is an auto industry celebrity, but Geeta‚Äôs background is equally impressive. A native of India, she holds multiple degrees in science, including a Ph.D. in biotechnology from Cambridge University where she was also a Research Newton Fellow. From there, she started a career in international investment for Lloyds Banking Group, and then managed investments for a high-net-worth client for several years. (In particular, this is insanely important - Geeta **KNOWS MONEY**! She knows how best to keep a company afloat, organize its share structure, provide value to shareholders, etc. because she has worked in the industry before. She may just be the most important element of Fisker Inc., due to the financial experience she has. At every step of the way, she is likely to make decisions with one sole focus - increasing share price and value).

She met her future husband in 2011 when he was visiting London, just before things started going very wrong at Fisker Automotive. They married in 2012.

‚ÄúWhen I left Fisker Automotive, all I had was my car,‚Äù Henrik remembers. ‚ÄúI'm in a different position, mainly because of Geeta. Because she cuts the deals.‚Äù

To get the new venture off the ground, the Fiskers invested the majority of their life savings‚Äìan enormous financial risk given the fate of Henrik‚Äôs prior company. Then, just as they were locking in plans for the IPO back in July, they were hit by a highly unwelcome complication: Geeta learned she had early-stage breast cancer.

‚ÄúShe got the call (from her doctor) during a call with investors,‚Äù Henrik says. Despite that bombshell, she continued working with banks and investors in the weeks that followed, even as she underwent two surgical procedures and radiation therapy. Her medical therapy concluded in November.

Henrik, who marvels at her fortitude throughout the health crisis says, ‚Äúshe only missed something like one day of work...That's just how she is. She works tirelessly.‚Äù

## Fisker Ocean

The Fisker Ocean will have a nearly 300-mile range with an 80 kWh battery and a solar panel roof as a range extender, adding approximately 1,000 free miles of range per year. Advanced electronics will be housed under the hood, and the vehicle will incorporate recycled and sustainable materials throughout. Deliveries of the Ocean are scheduled to begin in 2022.

&#x200B;

Fisker has also announced a partnership with Electrify America to ensure Fisker Ocean vehicles will integrate seamlessly with Electrify America charging stations when the e-SUV hits the market. With features such as a solar roof and recycled inner materials, it will be, according to Fisker Inc., the ""world's most sustainable vehicle.""

In 2017, Fisker Inc. announced that it had filed patents on flexible solid-state battery designs. Fisker expected the batteries to be produced on a mass scale around 2020. A prototype of the battery debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018. In October 2018, Fisker announced new funding for battery development through Caterpillar Venture Capital. The solid-state batteries are intended to deliver longer vehicle range and faster charging times.

In 2018, Fisker was named to the board of directors of First Cobalt, a North American cobalt refinery that produces battery materials.

In September 2019, it was announced that Fisker Inc. was partnering with Game of Thrones actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who will serve as a partner and sustainability adviser to Fisker, to work on advanced, affordable, electric mobility models.

&#x200B;

[In addition to being a well-known actor, Coster-Waldau is also the United Nations Development Program Goodwill Ambassador for climate change and other social issues.](https://preview.redd.it/3hssff5vfw171.png?width=451&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebe55e2468c5b63d1bc0ac3c71547219dff5afaa)

Nikolaj wrote this piece about Fisker:

To quote a friend of mine who is a lot smarter than me, architect Bjarke Ingels: ‚ÄúThe idea that sustainability needs to sacrifice quality of life is a flawed one. It‚Äôs a design challenge, a challenge to build something that transforms the idea of sustainability into something that will increase the quality of life for all those around it.‚Äù

One person meeting that challenge is Henrik Fisker, who has designed some of the most iconic cars over the past decades for BMW and others, like the BMW Z8, Aston Martin DB9 and Aston Martin V8 Vantage. He‚Äôs a hero for gas-guzzling supercars. He is a fellow Dane, I am a fan, and we met, of all places, on Twitter.

When we met in person, he described his new project ‚Äî an all-electric luxury SUV ‚Äî and asked me if I would help spread the word on his car. The problem as I see it with most electric cars is that they only accomplish the basics. They get you from point A to B. They run electric so you don‚Äôt pollute while driving, but that‚Äôs it. They are basically unattractive combustion engine cars that have a battery thrown into them ‚Äî and for most of them, a battery with a limited range. What Fisker does is to try to make every part of the car in a sustainable and attractive way, like a full-length solar roof, recycled floor mats and vegan leather seats. It looks incredibly cool and inviting, with a great 250- to 300-mile range, and at a cost of just under $40,000, it‚Äôs a luxury car affordable to a mass market.

I said yes and even became an investor, not only because it‚Äôs a great car but more importantly, I hope and believe it can inspire other companies to actively incorporate sustainability goals into all aspects of their business. Fisker then had the idea of calling me ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù adviser. Which I am not. Just to be clear. Thanks Henrik, sounds cool, but I am an actor and a citizen, and that‚Äôs really it.

And what about Hollywood? Is our industry changing, are we at the forefront? Looking at social media, you would think so. And things are happening, but usually only when a camera is pointed at people. Remember a few years back when all awards shows only used EVs for the red carpet? We made a difference. We mattered. We showed the way. So cool. So green, so ‚Ä¶ brief. Now it‚Äôs back to the Escalade. But hey, we are not using plastic straws anymore!

To believe that change will come from Hollywood is not really based in reality (when did that stop us?), but we are great at reacting ‚Äî and things around us are changing, and changing us. I have a good friend who loves his SUV. It‚Äôs not electric. But he cannot give up his car. He is a good guy, he‚Äôs works for the U.N., so if he has a problem going electric, we all do. But if he is presented with an alternative that doesn‚Äôt mean a reduction in his quality of life, something like the Fisker SUV, I think he‚Äôd transition to electric in a heartbeat.

The IPO deal values Fisker Inc at US$2.9 billion, with an IPO share price of $10.

On July 30, 2020, Fisker announced plans for a four-vehicle portfolio by 2025. The Fisker Ocean SUV will be joined by a sports sedan based on their previously announced Fisker Emotion concept, a coupe-like SUV, and a lifestyle pickup truck. All will be electric vehicles.

On October 15, 2020, Fisker Inc announced it would be outsourcing vehicle production of its Fisker Ocean electric SUV to Magna Steyr, to reduce the complexities and costs related to the building and operating its own factory. Magna will start building the Fisker Ocean in Europe in 2022.

## Henrik Fisker Interview quotes:

I have people on Twitter saying, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just make the car next month? You have a prototype.‚Äù Most people don‚Äôt understand that it takes 18 months to do long-lead body tooling for high-volume vehicles. Most people don‚Äôt understand it takes two years to do durability tests and do all the engineering certification and everything else.

And on the business model itself, I believe that there is nobody in the near future or the next couple of years that‚Äôs going to make a million EVs on one model. Today, there‚Äôs nobody doing it. Tesla probably has the highest volume of one single model, a couple hundred thousand. But even the big giant established carmakers are not making, right now, a couple hundred thousand vehicles of one model. So the way you get volume, in my view, is if you partner up with other OEMs and share some of the expensive parts of the platform, which in my view is not anymore something that is unique IP or something that is a unique experience to the customer. An aluminum stamped floor or a steel stamped floor really doesn‚Äôt have any brand value anymore.

And obviously, as we move forward, we always start to do some of the things ourselves. But it was really about de-risking in our first vehicle to market. So we‚Äôre going to do another three vehicles, which we can do because we don‚Äôt have to spend all our money and effort on learning how to manufacture a car, for instance.

So we have programmed a lot. We have hired a head of ESG, environmental and social governance, and he is really spearheading developing specific... we kind of put out some goals that we would like to reach with suppliers, and we at least try to bring them in that direction. They are not reaching those goals right now, but they may reach them later. And then we have goals for ourselves. So for instance, we look at transport. Are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs closer to the plant, or are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs on the other side of the planet that way we have to then transport all that stuff. So those are the types of things that we‚Äôre really thinking about now as we‚Äôre nominating suppliers. And finally, materials as well, looking at sustainable materials. We‚Äôve actually picked up a lot of knowledge on that side as well, where we are adding more sustainable materials to our vehicle. So we are actually looking across everything ‚Äî supply chain, where the suppliers are located, what the suppliers are doing for sustainability, and also then of course in the vehicle itself ‚Äî in terms of the type of materials there.

So - let's summarize - prices are rising at their fastest pace in almost 30 years and incomes just plunged by their most ever! We're gonna need more stimmies!""  

Plus  to above; 

Last year, Hirschman Capital noted that since 1821, 98% of sovereigns that hit 130% debt/GDP have defaulted on their sovereign debt.   

The US hit 130% late last year. 

Simple Conclussion : The Fed can‚Äôt go ‚Äúhawkish‚Äù and raise rates without sending markets ‚Äìand economies‚Äìto their knees; by extension, they now have nothing left to ‚Äúcut‚Äù when the current everything bubble implodes.

And that  is a *real problem*.

 There are only two ways for sovereigns to default: 

Inflation or collapse.    

The latter is not an option. 

 As for a solution, what‚Äôs so tragic is that the only option before the Fed is an even bigger problem‚Äîcurrent and inevitably more inflation. 

 That is, if the Fed wants to keep markets (and their job security) breathing, they no longer have the foregoing template of ‚Äúrate-hike-followed-by-rate-cutting‚Äù at their disposal, which means they now have no choice but to dovishly keep rates near the zero-bound indefinitely.

But the only way to keep rates ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù and nailed to the floor of time is to purchase otherwise unwanted bonds to keep their prices elevated and hence yields and rates repressed.

Such bond ‚Äúaccommodation,‚Äù of course, costs money, and as we already know, the only ‚Äúmoney‚Äù the Fed has to spend is the kind they create out of thin air‚Äì the very kind of money (and policy) which leads to the kind of inflation discussed above‚Äînamely, the brutal kind.

 As for that fake money, the evidence of the Fed‚Äôs desperate (and only) direction is now obvious, as the following M2 money supply makes equally clear. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v774ta55sw171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e73c839beb67a67eea9aed7de4ac61d86813840

 

Fed is so embarrassed by this ‚Äúprinting solution‚Äù that they‚Äôve stopped *weekly* reporting of M2 data, and frankly, since March, have even stopped *monthly* reporting of the same.

That, of course, is both telling as well as disgraceful‚Ä¶ The Fed literally has something to hide, and that never bodes well, does it?

&#x200B;

 The correlation to central bank balance sheet (i.e., money supply) expansion and rising markets is now beyond dispute. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sgizb6xcsw171.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=aad2fe681fe0c49ac20368aba77e86c118b22959

 In short‚Äîdo you see the correlation and pattern? Do you see how the Fed‚Äôs market sausage is made? More importantly, do you now see the Fed‚Äôs self-made conundrum? 

 

Given that the Fed bows to the markets not the people, which choice do you think they‚Äôll make?

In other words, expect more money printing and more yield curve control‚Äîand hence more money creation, more inflation, and by extension more fiat currency debasement.

 More money supply to keep rates monetized simply means more currency debasement and rising inflation.",nn51ou,"""Fed's ""Favorite"" #Inflation Indicator (PCE) Explodes At Fastest Rate Since 1992 As Incomes Crash By Record"""

I have leading indicators telling me that there are two concurrent shifts underway when it comes to who is purchasing homes.

\- Massive increase in unmarried people buying houses alone. This used to be somewhat unusual, now it's becoming very common.

\- Massive increase in unmarried men, in particular, buying houses alone. Traditionally, the female-to-male ratio of unmarried homebuyers was about 5 to 1. For the last 3 months, it's been closer to 50/50.

Source is my own closed real estate purchase transactions. Am a mortgage broker (btw this means cash purchases are ""invisible"" to me). It takes 3-6 months for [HMDA data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Mortgage_Disclosure_Act) to become accessible to journalists and academics, and thus ""visible"" to the general public (assuming journalists deem it worthy of commenting on), but I can see the trends live in real time.

How would one go about placing a bet that in about 3 or 6 months, the media, journalists, academics, etc, will pick up on this, publish articles, and potentially cause a lot of people to buy certain stocks. Which stocks would that be? Is there a ""Mancave, Inc"" out there that would potentially get an uptick? Or maybe a company making smart-home stuff that is particularly suited to renting by the room (the single men are not buying 1 bedroom condos, they are buying proper houses with 3 bedrooms, etc)?

EDIT: oh, and to be clear. It's not just an uptick in single men. It's an uptick in women too, but a massive surge from the men. It used to be that for 15 banana sales, 10 are to married couples, 4 to single women, and 1 to a single man. Now for the same 15 banana sales, it's 6 to married couples, 6 to single women, and 3 to single men, something like that.",nn76we,Homebuyer Demographics Shift towards single and male. How to bet?

(Some context) purchased 1 day calls options expiring on 5/28: 10 26$ calls 10 27$ calls 10 28$. 
Note this was the ü¶ç‚Äôs first option trade so he was going bananas üçå seeing all that fucking ü§ë tendies. Ape was bullish and let the stock run until it got smack down. Instead of rolling the calls and taking a profit he was hopeful and waiting for the stock to bounce back up. After AMC dropped to 31 then to 26 he said fuck it let it run till then end hoping for one last minute run.

6554,,2021-05-28 22:17:57,t3_nn96hb,,wallstreetbets," The AMC squeeze has actually been setup since February. Back in early February when you saw the squeezes of many companies, the two front runners being AMC and GME, they were the literal beginning of and were setting up the actual SHORT squeezes which are going to be never seen before numbers. guys if we go back in time to February just about after the squeezes, the hedge funds had just lost billions and billions after those gamma squeezes(I say gamma cause compared to what AMC is about to do it is nothing) and even after the squeezes they didn't even cover all of their positions(which you'll see why this is the cause of the current mega squeeze), they want to lose the least amount of money as possible so they aren't going to cover ALL of their shorts when the stock is still up around 5x to10x what they would've owed just days before, so they still kept shorting it after the squeeze and got it back down to around $5 per share, NOW, that $5 per share is still double or triple what they would've owed before the squeeze so this scares them, it would still put them in so much debt that they would probably much rather just not live with it so the only fucking thing they could have done was keep shorting the stock to get it down as least as possible to cover their shares as close as possible to the price they expected it to be at(which was very hard to guess but probably around $1-3 per share). The only thing that matters is that they didn't hit that mark and that absolutely fucked them, not going down to $1-3 per share back after the squeeze in February is the reason we are going to see AMC in the hundreds or even thousands by next week. The price not going to where they wanted, caused them to be left holding a bag that they needed and still need to pay eventually, the thing is there's no set date for when they need to cover so they can keep shorting it for as long as possible and try and get the stock down to where they want to cover the rest of the shorts they owed for the least amount of money possible, which i believe was that $1 to $3 mark. so they have been shorting AMC for months and have been doing so drastically since that February squeeze. the thing is they have been the slightest bit successful and that's why we haven't seen the squeeze sooner, AMC has been set to squeeze this whole time since February. if it ran through 15 the hedge funds would know it would take off and this squeeze would happen then and there, and they are trying to get this squeeze to not happen at all. instead you see $15 being tested plenty of times within these months and when it got close, the hedge funds had to short the stock drastically to not go rapidly through $15. we would have seen the squeeze sooner once it went rapidly through $15. However their success of keeping the stock below $15 had triggered them to believe it was still possible to get the stock down past $8 cause their new target price to cover their shorts was below 8 dollars. So the fact that AMC has held within that $8 to $15 range and didn't ever squeeze has caused the hedge funds to keep shorting it for absolutely no reason other than to get it down past $8, and since it hasn't happened for months, they had to short it for months, WELL GUESS WHAT. THEY RAN OUT OF FUCKING SHORT SHARES TO BORROW. THERE ARE 0 SHARES AVAILABLE TO BORROW. THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE. you will not even begin to understand what this causes. this means the hedge funds are having to cover all of the shorts they've been purchasing since February, which is essentially all of the short shares AMC has to offer and they cant borrow any so they HAVE to be payed for. the thing is the hedge funds haven't even begun to pay at all, like have payed 0% of what they owe and the stock has already tripled in just a couple days. the brokers have all the leverage and control over the hedge funds and the hedge funds owe the brokerage and HAVE to pay they cant borrow shorts like they used to anymore cause they bought so much there simply is none left to borrow and it is completely insane and unseen before. I know that no matter what, AMC is is currently worth to be set up at hundreds of dollars even thousands. I had bought in the middle of the last squeeze and have held a $15 per share position since February 2nd because I have know it has always been due to squeeze and there are thousands of people like me that have also known. the thing is that if it were to squeeze before it would be on a much smaller scale than what is about to happen because the hedge funds would have had short shares to borrow. now that there are none to borrow you guys actually don't know what this means for the stock. you can expect it to make one big pull up and a massive sell off before the actual squeeze. for those of you that understand this I know how excited you are but you also have to stay calm and remember how much manipulation there is and even if all the data and analysis is indicating huge gains it could possibly turn out to be huge losses. If i were you guys id take your own time and scale AMC up to the Volkswagen squeeze in 2008 and see how fucking similar they are. Stay safe",nn96hb,r/EAD THIS SHIT

Having such a massive big dick energy swing today on relative low volume is crazy bullish IMO.

It's capable of 35% or even 50% gap ups and isn't afraid to pull back to shake out the weak. Look at 12/1: opened 15% up, peaked 55% up then closed 26% down from that peak. Was that the end?

Nope, just the beginning...

1/14 was a +22% day, then it gapped 8% and peaked 26% up the next day before closing 14% down from that new high. 1/23: 28% gap up w/ +48% peak then corrected down 11% from that to close.

Still not the end...

1/27: opened up 6% then peaked 50% up to hit its momentary high of $28. Many of those happened on 300M+ volume vs 115M today.

I hope you don't think today was the end, because it was just the beginning. Don't be scared, don't be discouraged. Be happy...enjoy the long weekend and the holiday...get your exit strategy in place, because the coming week or two could be insane.",,

I don't know how covering the shorts is going to end, but if it's anything like 2008, there will be some serious quasi-illegal fuckery involved and retail will get screwed.

Bottom line this has turned into a speculative and emotional crusade rather than an investment in an actual stock. Nobody except us and the hedge funds are touching this with a 10 foot pole at current prices. These companies might succeed in the long term, but at current valuation guaranteed massive success is priced in, with no room for actual profit outside of muh short squeeze. Once the squeeze is squoze, if you're still holding you'll be bag holding for the foreseeable future. 

As for going whole ""going digital"" story with GME... It doesn't make any sense to me as a hardcore gamer. Why the fuck am I going to be buying anything digitally from GameStop when I can just buy it directly from steam or the appropriate console store. Maybe they buy licenses in bulk and offer them at a discount, but there's already websites that do that. If GameStop wanted to go digital they needed to start 10 years ago and establish themselves, they missed the boat at this point.

I don't know enough about AMCs fundamentals to comment on that one, but traditional movie theatres are not exactly a growth sector, especially now that people are going to expect straight to streaming releases. Maybe if they start expanding into those dinner theatres as the economy reopens there's room for growth there.

Vote with your money if your conscience demands it, but keep in mind you could be missing out on solid gains in actual companies with growth potential while your life savings are tied up in a moral crusade.

So say your average is like .50¬¢ if you sell a call at like 1.50$ strike right now on a bi monthly basis(every two weeks) you make like 7 bucks per contract. Keep in mind that it also essentially drops your average cost by the premium sold at. So if I sold covered calls against all of my shares at .07 per contract I net 7$ per contract x 50 contracts= 350$ plus I've now also dropped my average from .50 down to .43¬¢

I've been doing that with a much smaller position lately to average down and reinvest the earnings into sndl so I can sell more calls. 

I just try to go deep otm so that way my assignment risk is pretty low. If I were to get assigned on my calls I still make money... But it limits my profit potential. If I set my strike at 1.50 and the price jumps to 3  my profit potential stops at 1.50 whereas the dude who bought the call can keep on riding past 1.50. 

It's not hard just takes a tiny bit of research",,

Everyone is talking about how the squeeze didn't even happen and the shorts didn't cover yet. What I don't understand is why wouldn't that be possible? If short interest is 17%, so let's round up to about 100M shares. Today the volume traded was 700M shares. Couldn't 100M of those 700M have been the shorts covering? And if they didn't cover, today alone 700M shares were traded, why would 100M shares bought by shorts cause a squeeze if today 700M were traded?

I have been having this question for awhile, since I noticed the same with GME. In the days preceding January 28th (when GME reached its peak), the combined volume was several times the amount of float. How come the squeeze happened and why did it happen? If the volume was so high, couldn't the shorts have covered in the days preceding that?

I hope this makes sense and I really hope someone will be kind enough to explain a fellow retard who only knows about crayons what this all means.

Everything looked to have gone off successfully. We are now waiting on the data and craft to be analysed and inspected. This will take a few weeks according to Michael Colglazier.
That being said he had already outlined the test schedule in the earnings zoom call.

1st test flight - may 
2nd crewed flight - June 
3rd flight with R Branson on board late June/July 

4th flight this will be taking the Italian airforce on a training mission (600k a seat) late July


On the run in to the first test flight some possible maintenance issues appeared with the carrier plane White knight 2‚Ä¶. 
This indeed could have gone either way , after 2 weeks inspections it was decided that WK2 did not need to delay testing no maintenance was needed at this point. Scheduled Maintenance will commence in the fall after all tests have been completed.
Upon this news it is my opinion that the testing programme will go ahead as planned.

The market has responded accordingly and the stock is now up from $17-‚Ç¨31

With all these catalysts lined up before the end of the year and commercial operations looming for early 2022 things are looking up for Virgin Galactic.The success of the last test flight the company have now proven tech and concept.

I had a look at $BB and assume that we finally formed the bottom. In the last few days we saw a sharp rise which might continue in the next weeks. If we can break the 12$ resistance, the next targets would be aroung 25-28$. 

Using Elliot wave theory we are probably at the end of the correction wave 4 and now began with the bullish wave 5.

Price targets:

\#1 12$

\#2 25$

\#3 48$

The risk/reward is worth entering a trade here. I bought yesterday around 10$. My stop loss is below 8$.

7113,,2021-05-28 09:17:32,t3_nmtt43,,wallstreetbets,"Trainline has taken a huge dip since the UK government's announcement of the plan to nationalise the railway network. The plan includes creating an online ticketing platform by Great British Railways which might have a huge blow on Trainline revenue. However, this platform does not yet exist and will probably take a couple of years to develop. Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed.

In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales.  Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%.

I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time  for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

This is my first time making a post here, please do give constructive feedback and criticism.

7118,,2021-05-28 10:41:01,t3_nmuzzi,,wallstreetbets,"Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent of Modernas if not more. Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects) 

Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

Imagine if the spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize one piece to understand the whole picture it and helps modify your DNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates it can still recognize the virus. In contrast to using one portion of the picture as it mutates it's easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine, that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. Not only that but they have had the least amount of side effects of any covid vaccine deeming it the safest covid vaccine.... 

And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein (whole picture) and the safety profile. Also worth a mention is that you could store it in a regular refrigerator, and let it sit out in room temperature while you're vaccinating people instead of a special ultra low temp freeze needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers, this is a majority of the world. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines so other protein competitors will be far behind and they will have an a moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing they teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine. They will be combining flu and covid vaccine by 2025 for possibly double the price of current covid vaccine.

 They are pretty much de-risked at this point. Yes you could buy other  biotechs that can go up 20x but are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up) that has all successful trials done so far, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment to where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place there are no more glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""

They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. Yesterday at market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. 
 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

Future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract in there ( in the link below in another message). It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 

I own some $200 July calls along with about 933 shares. I'm all in baby.  Been in since $3.84 I sold once during February a couple months back and got back in a bit too early but I'm diamond hands all the way to $800 from here.  LFG I expect to turn that into over a cool million in a year's time via shares and options

Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. This is huge as the combo is going to differentiate them especially since both flu and covid vaccines are first in class.

Abs Gamma Strike: Unchanged

Gamma Notional: Decreased to $-516 (stock has larger put gamma position. A negative gamma position implies higher volatility in the underlying)

Call Wall Strike: Increased to 425 (When this strike is rolled higher it is generally considered bullish)

Gamma Tilt: Decreased to 0.88	 (when decreasing it‚Äôs a bearish signal.)

""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior.""

3) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $223.3M under Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19)
But, that is TOTAL Revenue; we need to find out what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike sales...
4) To calculate what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike Sales, we can use numbers from neighboring Q3 (i.e. Three Months Ended March 31, 2019)...
A) On page 6 of the 10-Q, you will find Revenue of ""Connected Fitness Products"" (aka Bike Sales) to be $261.6M
B) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $316.7M
C) % of Bike Sales per TOTAL Revenue: $261.6M / $316.7M * 100 = 82.6% {""Connected Fitness Products"" Revenue (aka Bike Sales)}
5) Apply 82.6% to the TOTAL Revenue $223.3M for Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19): $223.3M x 0.826 = $184.45M {Bike Sales for Q4 of fiscal '19}

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote... By mid-July, we‚Äôll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase precious metals  especially silver amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative 

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

Gold rose over 60% in the 1930s as the prices of stocks and real estate crashed. You could buy an entire block with a one ounce gold coin. Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms.

I must address Cramer's statement because he is obviously trying to add fuel to the short-selling fire: When he says ""we're not going natural gas"" he is clearly making a vague and general statement meant to be interpreted in the worst possible way: ""no one is going to buy or use natural gas."" By now, I hope everyone that is interested in this stock understands that CLNE offers an alternative transportation fuel, thus, the investments made by BP and Chevron, and not revolutionary technology like some EV's (but this is mostly hype meant to catapult EVs to the front. What most people do not realize is that driverless technology and such can be placed in Petro vehicles too). Also, unfortunately, the company has done a terrible marketting job. That's why powerful analysts can get away with making vague and unsupported statements. The fact that Cramer explained the stock's decrease over the last month as being due to widespread dissaproval is misleading, at best. Many people do not yet know about the cleanliness and therapeutic effects RNG has on the climate. We must get the word out and pressure CLNE corporate to begin marketting campaigns to get the word out. I think it's about time.",nn0whs,Cramer on CLNE

7146,,2021-05-28 17:33:28,t3_nn326f,,wallstreetbets,"What up peeps. I want to cover two tickers here, $SNDL which currently meets the sidebar rules with today's move. 1.6B market cap and is trading above $1. I get it mods, you gonna mod but I'll keep writing. The other is the infamous $TLRY.   


The News...

If you haven't read yet it looks like Federal Cannabis legalization my be around the corner. [Here](https://www.mpp.org/policy/federal/the-more-act/) is the House Bill. Supporters seem on board and like the reforms they have done to the bill including rescheduling cannabis. [Last time](https://mjbizdaily.com/key-us-house-lawmaker-reintroduces-federal-marijuana-legalization-bill/) the bill was introduced it cleared the House.   


Personally I think this gets a lot of support especially from a fiscal point of view. With stimulus stalling and a giant debate going on about how to pay for the stimulus I think cannabis offers the easiest way to collect federal revenue. A simple review of the bill and the fiscal benefits to the Fed's can be read [here](https://www.justtherealnews.com/congress/nadler-blumenauer-lee-jackson-lee-jeffries-velazquez-reintroduce-comprehensive-marijuana-reform-legislation/). The bill states a 5% fed tax. Money coming for uncle Sam, right when questions about paying for stimulus.... Personally I think it adds up, but that's for you to decide. 

Okay so that's the hype...

Let's talk about the tickers listed ($SNDL and $TLRY). 

$SNDL

I'll start with the cheaper YOLO, $SNDL. $SNDL short interest isn't high, but the company did issue convertible notes a while back around .7c if my memory is correct. I'm not saying they won't do it again, but they should be in a good place fiscally for now. Float is high with about 1.6B shares out there. However today's volume at the time of writing is over 415M. That's not bad given such a high float. It's about 200% more than the average volume. 

The options chain on $SNDL has me giddy. With over 200,000 options currently in the money on todays move above $1 there is some high potential here for some interesting action. The put to call ratio is just obnoxiously low at .08 it's screaming upwards betting. If we hold above $1 the potential squeeze up could be amazing.   


It's also broken up on the trend lines and out of the downward channel it was in. The regression channel from the peak squeeze back in Feb just broke out today according to my crayons I have laying around. 

$TLRY

$TLRY was the squeeze of a lifetime if you remember it back in 19'. The ticker was just a money printer with it's low float and stupid hype. Then they proceeded to do, like they all do, and issue debt. Shares tumbled since then falling from $120 --> $5. Ouch bag holders.   


Like all the cannabis stocks the Feb bump pushed $TLRY to above $60 in an amazing move. $TLRY has a lower short interest than $SNDL, but it also has a much lower float at about 300M. Compared to $SNDL the volume here isn't as good, but still remains decently above the avg volume around 36M as of right now. 

If we peep the options chain we also see a crazy low P/C ratio around .11. But we don't have the Open Interest in the chain like $SNDL does unless you roll out to Jun 18. Then we finally get some decent OI.   


Personally I am going with $SNDL. The option's chain looks better, the stock is cheaper, and the short interest is a little better. My advice would be to roll out till at least the Jun 11th $1 strike to not get eaten alive by Theta and IV crush. But WSB does what WSB wants and that's why I love you all.   
Do not go above the $2 strikes IMO. You will get crushed by theta unless we get an insane move, which could happen but I don't see the risk / reward there.",nn326f,MORE ACT / CANNABIS / $SNDL & $TLRY Potential

>A corner in the silver market has been tried before - and let's be clear, that is what is being attempted now.  In 1980, a rule change by the government destroyed the corner.  #silverthursday.

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday

>Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers‚Äô attempt to corner the market on the metal.

-
>Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926‚Äì2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers‚Äô Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.

-
>By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged‚ÄîMarch 27‚Äîsilver fell to $10.80, the metal‚Äôs biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, ‚ÄúA billion dollars isn‚Äôt what it used to be,‚Äù the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.

-
>To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978‚Äì91) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities.",nn36fw,There is no silver short squeeze happening.

* Henrik Fisker is a God among men in the automotive industry - trust him to do right
* Geeta Gupta-Fisker is a solid Chief Financial Officer with experience in investment banking - she will ensure the shares are valued right
* Henrik has learned from all the mistakes he made with his previous attempt to create Fisker Automotive, and will certainly do everything in his power to avoid that mess again. He has designed systems into the intricacies of the company to avoid failure - meaning Fisker Inc is guaranteed to succeed
* Henrik Fisker on shorting $FSR - ‚ÄúYou will quickly understand that you stand to lose a lot of money if you show it against Fisker‚Äù
* Production of Fisker Ocean expected to start in November 2022
* 250,000+ units a year expected by 2025
* Partnerships with Foxconn and Magna Steyr, both giants in their respective industries, among others
* Large Fleet market in Europe gaining momentum, and 700+ Fisker reservations in this market alone
* 16,000+ reservations already. More than Tesla had 18 months pre-production
* Revenue streams include leasing automotives, servicing, selling emissions credits, selling insurance (like selling the pickaxe to miners, and selling the diamonds to the mine owners too, absolutely genius - Fisker are insuring cars which they own, because the customer is only leasing it)
* High short interest (20%+), high analyst price targets compared to current share price (100%+) and low valuation compared to peers ($3bn market cap currently)
* Designing the first ever all-electric popemobile - Massive, soon to be historic, event!
* I give $FSR (currently $13 a share) a price target of $100 by end of year 2022, if not sooner
* Price Targets: $35 by end of year - Previous ATH. $50 start of next year - European and Chinese debut of prototypes. $100 end of 2022 - start of production (SOP). $150+ 2023
* 2025 Price Targets, calculated using projected data: Bear case - $97 a share, Bull case - $519 a share
* Downside in the short term is capped by the large amount of cash on hand - one third of market cap is cash. Long term, is capped by risk factors, which are almost eligible and affect every automotive startup anyway.

## Fisker Automotive

In 2008, Fisker Automotive raised over $90 million from investors including venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. In September 2009, Fisker Automotive was awarded a $528 million loan guarantee by the United States Department of Energy (DOE). The automaker was one of four recipients of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, to encourage the domestic manufacture of electric cars. The funds were to be used to develop the Karma, as well as an affordable family-size plug-in hybrid car. The loan facility was frozen at $192 million in February 2012, after the DOE claimed that Fisker missed its milestones

In December 2011, just as the Fisker Karma was launched, its battery supplier, A123 Systems, recalled all batteries, followed by a second recall in 2012. A123 filed for bankruptcy in October 2012, leaving Fisker Automotive without a battery supplier. After selling approximately 2,000 units, production of the Fisker Karma was suspended in November 2012, in the absence of its battery supplier.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/59vfj5wa8w171.png?width=511&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1c03d1e1254fea00c195776122de2b26099dd35

Henrik Fisker resigned as chairman from Fisker Automotive in March 2013, because of disagreements with management about business strategy. Later that year, the company declared voluntary bankruptcy.Fisker raised and spent more than a billion dollars over its lifetime.The heart of Fisker‚Äôs business model was in that early deal with Quantum. The idea was to design a gorgeous car, and have suppliers like Quantum provide the technology because off-the-shelf parts from suppliers would help keep costs down.

But there were problems with this strategy: Sometimes, those parts had to be custom-made to fit the design vision, which resulted in higher prices for Fisker. Other times, parts were delivered late or, worse, faulty, but Fisker was locked in to those supplier relationships. Sources close to Fisker have also said that many of the parts were owned by the suppliers themselves, so Fisker didn‚Äôt own a lot of the internal technology.

The broker that raised funds for Fisker automotive, by selling their private shares, was Advanced Equities.It wasn‚Äôt until December 2011 and into 2012 that the more dubious efforts of Advanced Equities became clearer to Fisker‚Äôs hundreds of investors. The last few hundred million dollars of Advanced Equities‚Äô fund raising for Fisker, starting with the D-1 round, was what brokers call ‚Äúpay to play.‚Äù As Fisker was running into technical, delivery and political problems, its valuation was quickly declining. But the company still needed more money, so the brokers went back to its current investors and said: Unless you give this more, your current shares will be diluted and your preferred stock will be converted to common stock.

It was essentially a gun to their heads. This is why investor Wray sued Fisker in February 2012, alleging he was on the receiving end of this tactic. In his lawsuit, he says Advanced Equities sent him a letter dated Jan. 18, 2012, stating that he needed to decide if he wanted to invest in Fisker‚Äôs next round, and pay around $84,000 by Jan. 27, 2012 ‚Äî a little over a week from receiving the letter. He also says that Advanced Equities assured him that he would have anti-dilution protection. According to the audio clip from Advanced Equities‚Äô internal sales call in early 2010, Advanced Equity leaders say that the Fisker deal will ‚Äúsuffer no dilution,‚Äù and was ‚Äúa dream scenario.‚Äù

That dream would soon end. In September 2012 after Fisker closed on $1.2 billion in funding, the bulk of it organized by Advanced Equities, the SEC charged the broker with misleading investors when it raised money for another company back in 2009 and 2010 (Bloom Energy). Advanced settled, agreeing to pay $1 million, and its co-founders were personally fined. Two months later Advanced Equities closed up shop.

Later, A123 Systems itself went bankrupt, causing more problems for Fisker. Fisker claimed that A123 Systems owed it $140 million, but a bankruptcy settlement reduced that to a paltry $15 million.

Then there was the just plain terrible luck for the ironically named Karma: Super Storm Sandy wiped out 338 of its Karmas in storage in New Jersey. The cars first drowned, and then caught on fire ‚Äî salt water damage caused a short circuit that was spread to other cars by high winds, Fisker said at the time.

With all of this happening in public ‚Äî and in a presidential election year ‚Äî Fisker‚Äôs struggles became highly politicized. The company was mentioned numerous times in presidential debates and speeches leading up to the election. Republican nominee Romney called Fisker and other DOE-supported companies losers.

The company didn‚Äôt seem to invest substantially in technology innovation or tech IP, and seemed to spend a disproportionate amount on suppliers. For example, numerous sources have said that the company paid upfront for 15,000 of some of the parts for its planned 15,000 Karmas. It ended up only selling around 2,000 of the cars. It has also been said that Fisker paid some funds upfront to have BMW make engines for the 100,000 Nina cars it hoped to produce ‚Äî in the end, Fisker didn‚Äôt deliver a single Nina.

Costs to build each Karma also creeped up because the company missed its volume targets, and because engineering had to change designs around supplier constraints. The company ended up adding $20,000 to its initial sale price.

Expensive hires may also have sucked away chunks of Fisker‚Äôs funding: Sources say that Fisker filled the upper levels of the company with seasoned auto executives from Detroit. At the high point of Fisker, the company had around 300 employees, plus dozens of contract staff. Bringing in a certain amount of the old guard could help a car startup ramp up quickly, and also impress potential investors with ‚Äúindustry names.‚Äù But those people are also used to big auto-industry budgets that included extensive travel and salaries ‚Äî that‚Äôs the opposite life of a tech startup.

## Fisker Inc.

In July 2016, Henrik Fisker expressed interest in designing a fully connected electric car with autonomous driving features and an aesthetically pleasing look. He has pursued battery technology, and hinted at potentially reviving the Fisker name with a pure-electric vehicle using technology that nobody else has. Since then Fisker has talked about delays to the promised solid state battery technology, which he does not expect to be able to be produced in volume until at least 2025. Posing risk for competition from more scientifically experienced future solid state battery producers such as Quantumscape.

***Forbes:*** ‚ÄúNow he‚Äôs back‚Äìand three things are different. First and foremost, he has a vital new partner: his wife, cofounder and Fisker Inc. CFO Geeta Gupta-Fisker. Second, his Los Angeles-based company is public this time around, raising more than $1 billion in an October 2020 IPO. And finally, Fisker‚Äôs stock price, up 56% since its debut, has made both Henrik and Geeta billionaires, each worth about $1.1 billion as of Friday‚Äôs market close. The auto industry has seen father-son and sibling leadership teams, but Fisker Inc.‚Äôs CEO-CFO combo is the fast-changing sector‚Äôs first husband and wife power couple.‚Äù

Wealth isn‚Äôt the purpose of the new company, Henrik says. ‚ÄúI never got into cars because of money. (This shows he is willing to do what is in the best interest of the company because he is not motivated by money, unlike 99% of other CEO‚Äôs)

The couple sought a big stake in the new venture to ensure they can control its fate in a way Fisker couldn‚Äôt with his earlier company.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yzhded6pfw171.png?width=408&format=png&auto=webp&s=54b30259720cf853a8efeacf058f2f74315260b9

Henrik is an auto industry celebrity, but Geeta‚Äôs background is equally impressive. A native of India, she holds multiple degrees in science, including a Ph.D. in biotechnology from Cambridge University where she was also a Research Newton Fellow. From there, she started a career in international investment for Lloyds Banking Group, and then managed investments for a high-net-worth client for several years. (In particular, this is insanely important - Geeta **KNOWS MONEY**! She knows how best to keep a company afloat, organize its share structure, provide value to shareholders, etc. because she has worked in the industry before. She may just be the most important element of Fisker Inc., due to the financial experience she has. At every step of the way, she is likely to make decisions with one sole focus - increasing share price and value).

She met her future husband in 2011 when he was visiting London, just before things started going very wrong at Fisker Automotive. They married in 2012.

‚ÄúWhen I left Fisker Automotive, all I had was my car,‚Äù Henrik remembers. ‚ÄúI'm in a different position, mainly because of Geeta. Because she cuts the deals.‚Äù

To get the new venture off the ground, the Fiskers invested the majority of their life savings‚Äìan enormous financial risk given the fate of Henrik‚Äôs prior company. Then, just as they were locking in plans for the IPO back in July, they were hit by a highly unwelcome complication: Geeta learned she had early-stage breast cancer.

‚ÄúShe got the call (from her doctor) during a call with investors,‚Äù Henrik says. Despite that bombshell, she continued working with banks and investors in the weeks that followed, even as she underwent two surgical procedures and radiation therapy. Her medical therapy concluded in November.

Henrik, who marvels at her fortitude throughout the health crisis says, ‚Äúshe only missed something like one day of work...That's just how she is. She works tirelessly.‚Äù

## Fisker Ocean

The Fisker Ocean will have a nearly 300-mile range with an 80 kWh battery and a solar panel roof as a range extender, adding approximately 1,000 free miles of range per year. Advanced electronics will be housed under the hood, and the vehicle will incorporate recycled and sustainable materials throughout. Deliveries of the Ocean are scheduled to begin in 2022.

Fisker has also announced a partnership with Electrify America to ensure Fisker Ocean vehicles will integrate seamlessly with Electrify America charging stations when the e-SUV hits the market. With features such as a solar roof and recycled inner materials, it will be, according to Fisker Inc., the ""world's most sustainable vehicle.""

In 2017, Fisker Inc. announced that it had filed patents on flexible solid-state battery designs. Fisker expected the batteries to be produced on a mass scale around 2020. A prototype of the battery debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018. In October 2018, Fisker announced new funding for battery development through Caterpillar Venture Capital. The solid-state batteries are intended to deliver longer vehicle range and faster charging times.

In 2018, Fisker was named to the board of directors of First Cobalt, a North American cobalt refinery that produces battery materials.

In September 2019, it was announced that Fisker Inc. was partnering with Game of Thrones actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who will serve as a partner and sustainability adviser to Fisker, to work on advanced, affordable, electric mobility models.

&#x200B;

[In addition to being a well-known actor, Coster-Waldau is also the United Nations Development Program Goodwill Ambassador for climate change and other social issues.](https://preview.redd.it/3hssff5vfw171.png?width=451&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebe55e2468c5b63d1bc0ac3c71547219dff5afaa)

Nikolaj wrote this piece about Fisker:

To quote a friend of mine who is a lot smarter than me, architect Bjarke Ingels: ‚ÄúThe idea that sustainability needs to sacrifice quality of life is a flawed one. It‚Äôs a design challenge, a challenge to build something that transforms the idea of sustainability into something that will increase the quality of life for all those around it.‚Äù

One person meeting that challenge is Henrik Fisker, who has designed some of the most iconic cars over the past decades for BMW and others, like the BMW Z8, Aston Martin DB9 and Aston Martin V8 Vantage. He‚Äôs a hero for gas-guzzling supercars. He is a fellow Dane, I am a fan, and we met, of all places, on Twitter.

When we met in person, he described his new project ‚Äî an all-electric luxury SUV ‚Äî and asked me if I would help spread the word on his car. The problem as I see it with most electric cars is that they only accomplish the basics. They get you from point A to B. They run electric so you don‚Äôt pollute while driving, but that‚Äôs it. They are basically unattractive combustion engine cars that have a battery thrown into them ‚Äî and for most of them, a battery with a limited range. What Fisker does is to try to make every part of the car in a sustainable and attractive way, like a full-length solar roof, recycled floor mats and vegan leather seats. It looks incredibly cool and inviting, with a great 250- to 300-mile range, and at a cost of just under $40,000, it‚Äôs a luxury car affordable to a mass market.

I said yes and even became an investor, not only because it‚Äôs a great car but more importantly, I hope and believe it can inspire other companies to actively incorporate sustainability goals into all aspects of their business. Fisker then had the idea of calling me ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù adviser. Which I am not. Just to be clear. Thanks Henrik, sounds cool, but I am an actor and a citizen, and that‚Äôs really it.

And what about Hollywood? Is our industry changing, are we at the forefront? Looking at social media, you would think so. And things are happening, but usually only when a camera is pointed at people. Remember a few years back when all awards shows only used EVs for the red carpet? We made a difference. We mattered. We showed the way. So cool. So green, so ‚Ä¶ brief. Now it‚Äôs back to the Escalade. But hey, we are not using plastic straws anymore!

To believe that change will come from Hollywood is not really based in reality (when did that stop us?), but we are great at reacting ‚Äî and things around us are changing, and changing us. I have a good friend who loves his SUV. It‚Äôs not electric. But he cannot give up his car. He is a good guy, he‚Äôs works for the U.N., so if he has a problem going electric, we all do. But if he is presented with an alternative that doesn‚Äôt mean a reduction in his quality of life, something like the Fisker SUV, I think he‚Äôd transition to electric in a heartbeat.

The IPO deal values Fisker Inc at US$2.9 billion, with an IPO share price of $10.

On July 30, 2020, Fisker announced plans for a four-vehicle portfolio by 2025. The Fisker Ocean SUV will be joined by a sports sedan based on their previously announced Fisker Emotion concept, a coupe-like SUV, and a lifestyle pickup truck. All will be electric vehicles.

On October 15, 2020, Fisker Inc announced it would be outsourcing vehicle production of its Fisker Ocean electric SUV to Magna Steyr, to reduce the complexities and costs related to the building and operating its own factory. Magna will start building the Fisker Ocean in Europe in 2022.

## Henrik Fisker Interview quotes:

I have people on Twitter saying, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just make the car next month? You have a prototype.‚Äù Most people don‚Äôt understand that it takes 18 months to do long-lead body tooling for high-volume vehicles. Most people don‚Äôt understand it takes two years to do durability tests and do all the engineering certification and everything else.

And on the business model itself, I believe that there is nobody in the near future or the next couple of years that‚Äôs going to make a million EVs on one model. Today, there‚Äôs nobody doing it. Tesla probably has the highest volume of one single model, a couple hundred thousand. But even the big giant established carmakers are not making, right now, a couple hundred thousand vehicles of one model. So the way you get volume, in my view, is if you partner up with other OEMs and share some of the expensive parts of the platform, which in my view is not anymore something that is unique IP or something that is a unique experience to the customer. An aluminum stamped floor or a steel stamped floor really doesn‚Äôt have any brand value anymore.

And obviously, as we move forward, we always start to do some of the things ourselves. But it was really about de-risking in our first vehicle to market. So we‚Äôre going to do another three vehicles, which we can do because we don‚Äôt have to spend all our money and effort on learning how to manufacture a car, for instance.

So we have programmed a lot. We have hired a head of ESG, environmental and social governance, and he is really spearheading developing specific... we kind of put out some goals that we would like to reach with suppliers, and we at least try to bring them in that direction. They are not reaching those goals right now, but they may reach them later. And then we have goals for ourselves. So for instance, we look at transport. Are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs closer to the plant, or are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs on the other side of the planet that way we have to then transport all that stuff. So those are the types of things that we‚Äôre really thinking about now as we‚Äôre nominating suppliers. And finally, materials as well, looking at sustainable materials. We‚Äôve actually picked up a lot of knowledge on that side as well, where we are adding more sustainable materials to our vehicle. So we are actually looking across everything ‚Äî supply chain, where the suppliers are located, what the suppliers are doing for sustainability, and also then of course in the vehicle itself ‚Äî in terms of the type of materials there.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nb8ozukrpw171.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd5a515f831dedcc57b25d717c5c133c0c74299d

So - let's summarize - prices are rising at their fastest pace in almost 30 years and incomes just plunged by their most ever! We're gonna need more stimmies!""  

Plus  to above; 

Last year, Hirschman Capital noted that since 1821, 98% of sovereigns that hit 130% debt/GDP have defaulted on their sovereign debt.   

The US hit 130% late last year. 

Simple Conclussion : The Fed can‚Äôt go ‚Äúhawkish‚Äù and raise rates without sending markets ‚Äìand economies‚Äìto their knees; by extension, they now have nothing left to ‚Äúcut‚Äù when the current everything bubble implodes.

And that  is a *real problem*.

 There are only two ways for sovereigns to default: 

Inflation or collapse.    

The latter is not an option. 

 As for a solution, what‚Äôs so tragic is that the only option before the Fed is an even bigger problem‚Äîcurrent and inevitably more inflation. 

 That is, if the Fed wants to keep markets (and their job security) breathing, they no longer have the foregoing template of ‚Äúrate-hike-followed-by-rate-cutting‚Äù at their disposal, which means they now have no choice but to dovishly keep rates near the zero-bound indefinitely.

But the only way to keep rates ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù and nailed to the floor of time is to purchase otherwise unwanted bonds to keep their prices elevated and hence yields and rates repressed.

Such bond ‚Äúaccommodation,‚Äù of course, costs money, and as we already know, the only ‚Äúmoney‚Äù the Fed has to spend is the kind they create out of thin air‚Äì the very kind of money (and policy) which leads to the kind of inflation discussed above‚Äînamely, the brutal kind.

 As for that fake money, the evidence of the Fed‚Äôs desperate (and only) direction is now obvious, as the following M2 money supply makes equally clear. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v774ta55sw171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e73c839beb67a67eea9aed7de4ac61d86813840

 

Fed is so embarrassed by this ‚Äúprinting solution‚Äù that they‚Äôve stopped *weekly* reporting of M2 data, and frankly, since March, have even stopped *monthly* reporting of the same.

That, of course, is both telling as well as disgraceful‚Ä¶ The Fed literally has something to hide, and that never bodes well, does it?

&#x200B;

 The correlation to central bank balance sheet (i.e., money supply) expansion and rising markets is now beyond dispute. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sgizb6xcsw171.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=aad2fe681fe0c49ac20368aba77e86c118b22959

 In short‚Äîdo you see the correlation and pattern? Do you see how the Fed‚Äôs market sausage is made? More importantly, do you now see the Fed‚Äôs self-made conundrum? 

 

Given that the Fed bows to the markets not the people, which choice do you think they‚Äôll make?

In other words, expect more money printing and more yield curve control‚Äîand hence more money creation, more inflation, and by extension more fiat currency debasement.

 More money supply to keep rates monetized simply means more currency debasement and rising inflation.",nn51ou,"""Fed's ""Favorite"" #Inflation Indicator (PCE) Explodes At Fastest Rate Since 1992 As Incomes Crash By Record"""

I have leading indicators telling me that there are two concurrent shifts underway when it comes to who is purchasing homes.

\- Massive increase in unmarried people buying houses alone. This used to be somewhat unusual, now it's becoming very common.

\- Massive increase in unmarried men, in particular, buying houses alone. Traditionally, the female-to-male ratio of unmarried homebuyers was about 5 to 1. For the last 3 months, it's been closer to 50/50.

Source is my own closed real estate purchase transactions. Am a mortgage broker (btw this means cash purchases are ""invisible"" to me). It takes 3-6 months for [HMDA data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Mortgage_Disclosure_Act) to become accessible to journalists and academics, and thus ""visible"" to the general public (assuming journalists deem it worthy of commenting on), but I can see the trends live in real time.

How would one go about placing a bet that in about 3 or 6 months, the media, journalists, academics, etc, will pick up on this, publish articles, and potentially cause a lot of people to buy certain stocks. Which stocks would that be? Is there a ""Mancave, Inc"" out there that would potentially get an uptick? Or maybe a company making smart-home stuff that is particularly suited to renting by the room (the single men are not buying 1 bedroom condos, they are buying proper houses with 3 bedrooms, etc)?

EDIT: oh, and to be clear. It's not just an uptick in single men. It's an uptick in women too, but a massive surge from the men. It used to be that for 15 banana sales, 10 are to married couples, 4 to single women, and 1 to a single man. Now for the same 15 banana sales, it's 6 to married couples, 6 to single women, and 3 to single men, something like that.",nn76we,Homebuyer Demographics Shift towards single and male. How to bet?

7168,,2021-05-28 22:17:57,t3_nn96hb,,wallstreetbets," The AMC squeeze has actually been setup since February. Back in early February when you saw the squeezes of many companies, the two front runners being AMC and GME, they were the literal beginning of and were setting up the actual SHORT squeezes which are going to be never seen before numbers. guys if we go back in time to February just about after the squeezes, the hedge funds had just lost billions and billions after those gamma squeezes(I say gamma cause compared to what AMC is about to do it is nothing) and even after the squeezes they didn't even cover all of their positions(which you'll see why this is the cause of the current mega squeeze), they want to lose the least amount of money as possible so they aren't going to cover ALL of their shorts when the stock is still up around 5x to10x what they would've owed just days before, so they still kept shorting it after the squeeze and got it back down to around $5 per share, NOW, that $5 per share is still double or triple what they would've owed before the squeeze so this scares them, it would still put them in so much debt that they would probably much rather just not live with it so the only fucking thing they could have done was keep shorting the stock to get it down as least as possible to cover their shares as close as possible to the price they expected it to be at(which was very hard to guess but probably around $1-3 per share). The only thing that matters is that they didn't hit that mark and that absolutely fucked them, not going down to $1-3 per share back after the squeeze in February is the reason we are going to see AMC in the hundreds or even thousands by next week. The price not going to where they wanted, caused them to be left holding a bag that they needed and still need to pay eventually, the thing is there's no set date for when they need to cover so they can keep shorting it for as long as possible and try and get the stock down to where they want to cover the rest of the shorts they owed for the least amount of money possible, which i believe was that $1 to $3 mark. so they have been shorting AMC for months and have been doing so drastically since that February squeeze. the thing is they have been the slightest bit successful and that's why we haven't seen the squeeze sooner, AMC has been set to squeeze this whole time since February. if it ran through 15 the hedge funds would know it would take off and this squeeze would happen then and there, and they are trying to get this squeeze to not happen at all. instead you see $15 being tested plenty of times within these months and when it got close, the hedge funds had to short the stock drastically to not go rapidly through $15. we would have seen the squeeze sooner once it went rapidly through $15. However their success of keeping the stock below $15 had triggered them to believe it was still possible to get the stock down past $8 cause their new target price to cover their shorts was below 8 dollars. So the fact that AMC has held within that $8 to $15 range and didn't ever squeeze has caused the hedge funds to keep shorting it for absolutely no reason other than to get it down past $8, and since it hasn't happened for months, they had to short it for months, WELL GUESS WHAT. THEY RAN OUT OF FUCKING SHORT SHARES TO BORROW. THERE ARE 0 SHARES AVAILABLE TO BORROW. THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE. you will not even begin to understand what this causes. this means the hedge funds are having to cover all of the shorts they've been purchasing since February, which is essentially all of the short shares AMC has to offer and they cant borrow any so they HAVE to be payed for. the thing is the hedge funds haven't even begun to pay at all, like have payed 0% of what they owe and the stock has already tripled in just a couple days. the brokers have all the leverage and control over the hedge funds and the hedge funds owe the brokerage and HAVE to pay they cant borrow shorts like they used to anymore cause they bought so much there simply is none left to borrow and it is completely insane and unseen before. I know that no matter what, AMC is is currently worth to be set up at hundreds of dollars even thousands. I had bought in the middle of the last squeeze and have held a $15 per share position since February 2nd because I have know it has always been due to squeeze and there are thousands of people like me that have also known. the thing is that if it were to squeeze before it would be on a much smaller scale than what is about to happen because the hedge funds would have had short shares to borrow. now that there are none to borrow you guys actually don't know what this means for the stock. you can expect it to make one big pull up and a massive sell off before the actual squeeze. for those of you that understand this I know how excited you are but you also have to stay calm and remember how much manipulation there is and even if all the data and analysis is indicating huge gains it could possibly turn out to be huge losses. If i were you guys id take your own time and scale AMC up to the Volkswagen squeeze in 2008 and see how fucking similar they are. Stay safe",nn96hb,r/EAD THIS SHIT

Everyone is talking about how the squeeze didn't even happen and the shorts didn't cover yet. What I don't understand is why wouldn't that be possible? If short interest is 17%, so let's round up to about 100M shares. Today the volume traded was 700M shares. Couldn't 100M of those 700M have been the shorts covering? And if they didn't cover, today alone 700M shares were traded, why would 100M shares bought by shorts cause a squeeze if today 700M were traded?

I have been having this question for awhile, since I noticed the same with GME. In the days preceding January 28th (when GME reached its peak), the combined volume was several times the amount of float. How come the squeeze happened and why did it happen? If the volume was so high, couldn't the shorts have covered in the days preceding that?

I hope this makes sense and I really hope someone will be kind enough to explain a fellow retard who only knows about crayons what this all means.

Everything looked to have gone off successfully. We are now waiting on the data and craft to be analysed and inspected. This will take a few weeks according to Michael Colglazier.
That being said he had already outlined the test schedule in the earnings zoom call.

1st test flight - may 
2nd crewed flight - June 
3rd flight with R Branson on board late June/July 

4th flight this will be taking the Italian airforce on a training mission (600k a seat) late July


On the run in to the first test flight some possible maintenance issues appeared with the carrier plane White knight 2‚Ä¶. 
This indeed could have gone either way , after 2 weeks inspections it was decided that WK2 did not need to delay testing no maintenance was needed at this point. Scheduled Maintenance will commence in the fall after all tests have been completed.
Upon this news it is my opinion that the testing programme will go ahead as planned.

The market has responded accordingly and the stock is now up from $17-‚Ç¨31

With all these catalysts lined up before the end of the year and commercial operations looming for early 2022 things are looking up for Virgin Galactic.The success of the last test flight the company have now proven tech and concept. 
Also with revenue now coming in Nasa who are conducting micro gravity analysis.
Also international training for military pilots and astronauts.
Commercial flights look imminent.

I had a look at $BB and assume that we finally formed the bottom. In the last few days we saw a sharp rise which might continue in the next weeks. If we can break the 12$ resistance, the next targets would be aroung 25-28$. 

Using Elliot wave theory we are probably at the end of the correction wave 4 and now began with the bullish wave 5.

Price targets:

\#1 12$

\#2 25$

\#3 48$

The risk/reward is worth entering a trade here. I bought yesterday around 10$. My stop loss is below 8$.

Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed.

In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales.  Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%.

I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time  for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

This is my first time making a post here, please do give constructive feedback and criticism.

7559,,2021-05-28 10:41:01,t3_nmuzzi,,wallstreetbets,"Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent of Modernas if not more. Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects) 

Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

Imagine if the spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize one piece to understand the whole picture it and helps modify your DNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates it can still recognize the virus. In contrast to using one portion of the picture as it mutates it's easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine, that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. Not only that but they have had the least amount of side effects of any covid vaccine deeming it the safest covid vaccine.... 

And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein (whole picture) and the safety profile. Also worth a mention is that you could store it in a regular refrigerator, and let it sit out in room temperature while you're vaccinating people instead of a special ultra low temp freeze needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers, this is a majority of the world. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines so other protein competitors will be far behind and they will have an a moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing they teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine. They will be combining flu and covid vaccine by 2025 for possibly double the price of current covid vaccine.

 They are pretty much de-risked at this point. Yes you could buy other  biotechs that can go up 20x but are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up) that has all successful trials done so far, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment to where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place there are no more glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""

They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. Yesterday at market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. 
 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

Future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract in there ( in the link below in another message). It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 

I own some $200 July calls along with about 933 shares. I'm all in baby.  Been in since $3.84 I sold once during February a couple months back and got back in a bit too early but I'm diamond hands all the way to $800 from here.  LFG I expect to turn that into over a cool million in a year's time via shares and options

Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. This is huge as the combo is going to differentiate them especially since both flu and covid vaccines are first in class.

Looks like low volatility day. Play tight.

Note from SG: ""For todays expiration our models show about 15% SPX /30% SPY gamma expiring, which could allow volatility increase a bit into next week. This in turn may free markets for a push up into that 4250 target (Call Wall) area.""

Gamma Index: decreased to -0.1 (A large negative figure indicates volatility may be high. The range is from 4 to ‚Äì4.)

Vol Trigger: Increased to 419 (Important support and resistance level. (above this level = lower volatility and a more stable stock price.)

Abs Gamma Strike: Unchanged

Gamma Notional: Decreased to $-516 (stock has larger put gamma position. A negative gamma position implies higher volatility in the underlying)

Put Wall Support: Increased to 419 (If Put Wall shifts to a higher strike it could be a bearish indication)

Call Wall Strike: Increased to 425 (When this strike is rolled higher it is generally considered bullish)

Gamma Tilt: Decreased to 0.88	 (when decreasing it‚Äôs a bearish signal.)

Net Delta: Increased to 198k (positive delta position infers options market makers have a net long hedge.)

25d risk reversal: Increased to -0.06 (When the ratio shifts towards 0 it indicates call demand)

""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior.""
2) Being that we do not have access to a 10-K filing for Q4 fiscal '19, we will access other filings that do in fact reference numbers from fiscal '19...
A) 10-K filing dated 9/11/2020
B) 10-Q filing dated 5/6/2020
3) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $223.3M under Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19)
But, that is TOTAL Revenue; we need to find out what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike sales...
4) To calculate what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike Sales, we can use numbers from neighboring Q3 (i.e. Three Months Ended March 31, 2019)...
A) On page 6 of the 10-Q, you will find Revenue of ""Connected Fitness Products"" (aka Bike Sales) to be $261.6M
B) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $316.7M
C) % of Bike Sales per TOTAL Revenue: $261.6M / $316.7M * 100 = 82.6% {""Connected Fitness Products"" Revenue (aka Bike Sales)}
5) Apply 82.6% to the TOTAL Revenue $223.3M for Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19): $223.3M x 0.826 = $184.45M {Bike Sales for Q4 of fiscal '19}

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote... By mid-July, we‚Äôll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase precious metals  especially silver amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative 

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

Gold rose over 60% in the 1930s as the prices of stocks and real estate crashed. You could buy an entire block with a one ounce gold coin. Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms.

I must address Cramer's statement because he is obviously trying to add fuel to the short-selling fire: When he says ""we're not going natural gas"" he is clearly making a vague and general statement meant to be interpreted in the worst possible way: ""no one is going to buy or use natural gas."" By now, I hope everyone that is interested in this stock understands that CLNE offers an alternative transportation fuel, thus, the investments made by BP and Chevron, and not revolutionary technology like some EV's (but this is mostly hype meant to catapult EVs to the front. What most people do not realize is that driverless technology and such can be placed in Petro vehicles too). Also, unfortunately, the company has done a terrible marketting job. That's why powerful analysts can get away with making vague and unsupported statements. The fact that Cramer explained the stock's decrease over the last month as being due to widespread dissaproval is misleading, at best. Many people do not yet know about the cleanliness and therapeutic effects RNG has on the climate.

The News...

If you haven't read yet it looks like Federal Cannabis legalization my be around the corner. [Here](https://www.mpp.org/policy/federal/the-more-act/) is the House Bill. Supporters seem on board and like the reforms they have done to the bill including rescheduling cannabis. [Last time](https://mjbizdaily.com/key-us-house-lawmaker-reintroduces-federal-marijuana-legalization-bill/) the bill was introduced it cleared the House.   


Personally I think this gets a lot of support especially from a fiscal point of view. With stimulus stalling and a giant debate going on about how to pay for the stimulus I think cannabis offers the easiest way to collect federal revenue. A simple review of the bill and the fiscal benefits to the Fed's can be read [here](https://www.justtherealnews.com/congress/nadler-blumenauer-lee-jackson-lee-jeffries-velazquez-reintroduce-comprehensive-marijuana-reform-legislation/). The bill states a 5% fed tax. Money coming for uncle Sam, right when questions about paying for stimulus.... Personally I think it adds up, but that's for you to decide. 

Okay so that's the hype...

Let's talk about the tickers listed ($SNDL and $TLRY). 

$SNDL

I'll start with the cheaper YOLO, $SNDL. $SNDL short interest isn't high, but the company did issue convertible notes a while back around .7c if my memory is correct. I'm not saying they won't do it again, but they should be in a good place fiscally for now. Float is high with about 1.6B shares out there. However today's volume at the time of writing is over 415M. That's not bad given such a high float. It's about 200% more than the average volume. 

The options chain on $SNDL has me giddy. With over 200,000 options currently in the money on todays move above $1 there is some high potential here for some interesting action. The put to call ratio is just obnoxiously low at .08 it's screaming upwards betting. If we hold above $1 the potential squeeze up could be amazing.   


It's also broken up on the trend lines and out of the downward channel it was in. The regression channel from the peak squeeze back in Feb just broke out today according to my crayons I have laying around. 

$TLRY

$TLRY was the squeeze of a lifetime if you remember it back in 19'. The ticker was just a money printer with it's low float and stupid hype. Then they proceeded to do, like they all do, and issue debt. Shares tumbled since then falling from $120 --> $5. Ouch bag holders.   


Like all the cannabis stocks the Feb bump pushed $TLRY to above $60 in an amazing move. $TLRY has a lower short interest than $SNDL, but it also has a much lower float at about 300M. Compared to $SNDL the volume here isn't as good, but still remains decently above the avg volume around 36M as of right now. 

If we peep the options chain we also see a crazy low P/C ratio around .11. But we don't have the Open Interest in the chain like $SNDL does unless you roll out to Jun 18. Then we finally get some decent OI.   


Personally I am going with $SNDL. The option's chain looks better, the stock is cheaper, and the short interest is a little better. My advice would be to roll out till at least the Jun 11th $1 strike to not get eaten alive by Theta and IV crush. But WSB does what WSB wants and that's why I love you all.   
Do not go above the $2 strikes IMO. You will get crushed by theta unless we get an insane move, which could happen but I don't see the risk / reward there.",nn326f,MORE ACT / CANNABIS / $SNDL & $TLRY Potential

>A corner in the silver market has been tried before - and let's be clear, that is what is being attempted now.  In 1980, a rule change by the government destroyed the corner.  #silverthursday.

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday

>Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers‚Äô attempt to corner the market on the metal.

-
>Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926‚Äì2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers‚Äô Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.

-
>By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged‚ÄîMarch 27‚Äîsilver fell to $10.80, the metal‚Äôs biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, ‚ÄúA billion dollars isn‚Äôt what it used to be,‚Äù the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.

-
>To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978‚Äì91) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities.",nn36fw,There is no silver short squeeze happening.

* Henrik Fisker is a God among men in the automotive industry - trust him to do right
* Geeta Gupta-Fisker is a solid Chief Financial Officer with experience in investment banking - she will ensure the shares are valued right
* Henrik has learned from all the mistakes he made with his previous attempt to create Fisker Automotive, and will certainly do everything in his power to avoid that mess again. He has designed systems into the intricacies of the company to avoid failure - meaning Fisker Inc is guaranteed to succeed
* Henrik Fisker on shorting $FSR - ‚ÄúYou will quickly understand that you stand to lose a lot of money if you show it against Fisker‚Äù
* Production of Fisker Ocean expected to start in November 2022
* 250,000+ units a year expected by 2025
* Partnerships with Foxconn and Magna Steyr, both giants in their respective industries, among others
* Large Fleet market in Europe gaining momentum, and 700+ Fisker reservations in this market alone
* 16,000+ reservations already. More than Tesla had 18 months pre-production
* Revenue streams include leasing automotives, servicing, selling emissions credits, selling insurance (like selling the pickaxe to miners, and selling the diamonds to the mine owners too, absolutely genius - Fisker are insuring cars which they own, because the customer is only leasing it)
* High short interest (20%+), high analyst price targets compared to current share price (100%+) and low valuation compared to peers ($3bn market cap currently)
* Designing the first ever all-electric popemobile - Massive, soon to be historic, event!
* I give $FSR (currently $13 a share) a price target of $100 by end of year 2022, if not sooner
* Price Targets: $35 by end of year - Previous ATH. $50 start of next year - European and Chinese debut of prototypes. $100 end of 2022 - start of production (SOP). $150+ 2023
* 2025 Price Targets, calculated using projected data: Bear case - $97 a share, Bull case - $519 a share
* Downside in the short term is capped by the large amount of cash on hand - one third of market cap is cash. Long term, is capped by risk factors, which are almost eligible and affect every automotive startup anyway.

## Fisker Automotive

In 2008, Fisker Automotive raised over $90 million from investors including venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. In September 2009, Fisker Automotive was awarded a $528 million loan guarantee by the United States Department of Energy (DOE). The automaker was one of four recipients of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, to encourage the domestic manufacture of electric cars. The funds were to be used to develop the Karma, as well as an affordable family-size plug-in hybrid car. The loan facility was frozen at $192 million in February 2012, after the DOE claimed that Fisker missed its milestones

In December 2011, just as the Fisker Karma was launched, its battery supplier, A123 Systems, recalled all batteries, followed by a second recall in 2012. A123 filed for bankruptcy in October 2012, leaving Fisker Automotive without a battery supplier. After selling approximately 2,000 units, production of the Fisker Karma was suspended in November 2012, in the absence of its battery supplier.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/59vfj5wa8w171.png?width=511&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1c03d1e1254fea00c195776122de2b26099dd35

Henrik Fisker resigned as chairman from Fisker Automotive in March 2013, because of disagreements with management about business strategy. Later that year, the company declared voluntary bankruptcy.Fisker raised and spent more than a billion dollars over its lifetime.The heart of Fisker‚Äôs business model was in that early deal with Quantum. The idea was to design a gorgeous car, and have suppliers like Quantum provide the technology because off-the-shelf parts from suppliers would help keep costs down.

But there were problems with this strategy: Sometimes, those parts had to be custom-made to fit the design vision, which resulted in higher prices for Fisker. Other times, parts were delivered late or, worse, faulty, but Fisker was locked in to those supplier relationships. Sources close to Fisker have also said that many of the parts were owned by the suppliers themselves, so Fisker didn‚Äôt own a lot of the internal technology.

The broker that raised funds for Fisker automotive, by selling their private shares, was Advanced Equities.It wasn‚Äôt until December 2011 and into 2012 that the more dubious efforts of Advanced Equities became clearer to Fisker‚Äôs hundreds of investors. The last few hundred million dollars of Advanced Equities‚Äô fund raising for Fisker, starting with the D-1 round, was what brokers call ‚Äúpay to play.‚Äù As Fisker was running into technical, delivery and political problems, its valuation was quickly declining. But the company still needed more money, so the brokers went back to its current investors and said: Unless you give this more, your current shares will be diluted and your preferred stock will be converted to common stock.

It was essentially a gun to their heads. This is why investor Wray sued Fisker in February 2012, alleging he was on the receiving end of this tactic. In his lawsuit, he says Advanced Equities sent him a letter dated Jan. 18, 2012, stating that he needed to decide if he wanted to invest in Fisker‚Äôs next round, and pay around $84,000 by Jan. 27, 2012 ‚Äî a little over a week from receiving the letter. He also says that Advanced Equities assured him that he would have anti-dilution protection. According to the audio clip from Advanced Equities‚Äô internal sales call in early 2010, Advanced Equity leaders say that the Fisker deal will ‚Äúsuffer no dilution,‚Äù and was ‚Äúa dream scenario.‚Äù

That dream would soon end. In September 2012 after Fisker closed on $1.2 billion in funding, the bulk of it organized by Advanced Equities, the SEC charged the broker with misleading investors when it raised money for another company back in 2009 and 2010 (Bloom Energy). Advanced settled, agreeing to pay $1 million, and its co-founders were personally fined. Two months later Advanced Equities closed up shop.

Later, A123 Systems itself went bankrupt, causing more problems for Fisker. Fisker claimed that A123 Systems owed it $140 million, but a bankruptcy settlement reduced that to a paltry $15 million.

Then there was the just plain terrible luck for the ironically named Karma: Super Storm Sandy wiped out 338 of its Karmas in storage in New Jersey. The cars first drowned, and then caught on fire ‚Äî salt water damage caused a short circuit that was spread to other cars by high winds, Fisker said at the time.

With all of this happening in public ‚Äî and in a presidential election year ‚Äî Fisker‚Äôs struggles became highly politicized. The company was mentioned numerous times in presidential debates and speeches leading up to the election. Republican nominee Romney called Fisker and other DOE-supported companies losers.

The company didn‚Äôt seem to invest substantially in technology innovation or tech IP, and seemed to spend a disproportionate amount on suppliers. For example, numerous sources have said that the company paid upfront for 15,000 of some of the parts for its planned 15,000 Karmas. It ended up only selling around 2,000 of the cars. It has also been said that Fisker paid some funds upfront to have BMW make engines for the 100,000 Nina cars it hoped to produce ‚Äî in the end, Fisker didn‚Äôt deliver a single Nina.

Costs to build each Karma also creeped up because the company missed its volume targets, and because engineering had to change designs around supplier constraints. The company ended up adding $20,000 to its initial sale price.

Expensive hires may also have sucked away chunks of Fisker‚Äôs funding: Sources say that Fisker filled the upper levels of the company with seasoned auto executives from Detroit. At the high point of Fisker, the company had around 300 employees, plus dozens of contract staff. Bringing in a certain amount of the old guard could help a car startup ramp up quickly, and also impress potential investors with ‚Äúindustry names.‚Äù But those people are also used to big auto-industry budgets that included extensive travel and salaries ‚Äî that‚Äôs the opposite life of a tech startup.

## Fisker Inc.

In July 2016, Henrik Fisker expressed interest in designing a fully connected electric car with autonomous driving features and an aesthetically pleasing look. He has pursued battery technology, and hinted at potentially reviving the Fisker name with a pure-electric vehicle using technology that nobody else has. Since then Fisker has talked about delays to the promised solid state battery technology, which he does not expect to be able to be produced in volume until at least 2025. Posing risk for competition from more scientifically experienced future solid state battery producers such as Quantumscape.

***Forbes:*** ‚ÄúNow he‚Äôs back‚Äìand three things are different. First and foremost, he has a vital new partner: his wife, cofounder and Fisker Inc. CFO Geeta Gupta-Fisker. Second, his Los Angeles-based company is public this time around, raising more than $1 billion in an October 2020 IPO. And finally, Fisker‚Äôs stock price, up 56% since its debut, has made both Henrik and Geeta billionaires, each worth about $1.1 billion as of Friday‚Äôs market close. The auto industry has seen father-son and sibling leadership teams, but Fisker Inc.‚Äôs CEO-CFO combo is the fast-changing sector‚Äôs first husband and wife power couple.‚Äù

Wealth isn‚Äôt the purpose of the new company, Henrik says. ‚ÄúI never got into cars because of money. (This shows he is willing to do what is in the best interest of the company because he is not motivated by money, unlike 99% of other CEO‚Äôs)

The couple sought a big stake in the new venture to ensure they can control its fate in a way Fisker couldn‚Äôt with his earlier company.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yzhded6pfw171.png?width=408&format=png&auto=webp&s=54b30259720cf853a8efeacf058f2f74315260b9

Henrik is an auto industry celebrity, but Geeta‚Äôs background is equally impressive. A native of India, she holds multiple degrees in science, including a Ph.D. in biotechnology from Cambridge University where she was also a Research Newton Fellow. From there, she started a career in international investment for Lloyds Banking Group, and then managed investments for a high-net-worth client for several years. (In particular, this is insanely important - Geeta **KNOWS MONEY**! She knows how best to keep a company afloat, organize its share structure, provide value to shareholders, etc. because she has worked in the industry before. She may just be the most important element of Fisker Inc., due to the financial experience she has. At every step of the way, she is likely to make decisions with one sole focus - increasing share price and value).

She met her future husband in 2011 when he was visiting London, just before things started going very wrong at Fisker Automotive. They married in 2012.

‚ÄúWhen I left Fisker Automotive, all I had was my car,‚Äù Henrik remembers. ‚ÄúI'm in a different position, mainly because of Geeta. Because she cuts the deals.‚Äù

To get the new venture off the ground, the Fiskers invested the majority of their life savings‚Äìan enormous financial risk given the fate of Henrik‚Äôs prior company. Then, just as they were locking in plans for the IPO back in July, they were hit by a highly unwelcome complication: Geeta learned she had early-stage breast cancer.

‚ÄúShe got the call (from her doctor) during a call with investors,‚Äù Henrik says. Despite that bombshell, she continued working with banks and investors in the weeks that followed, even as she underwent two surgical procedures and radiation therapy. Her medical therapy concluded in November.

Henrik, who marvels at her fortitude throughout the health crisis says, ‚Äúshe only missed something like one day of work...That's just how she is. She works tirelessly.‚Äù

## Fisker Ocean

The Fisker Ocean will have a nearly 300-mile range with an 80 kWh battery and a solar panel roof as a range extender, adding approximately 1,000 free miles of range per year. Advanced electronics will be housed under the hood, and the vehicle will incorporate recycled and sustainable materials throughout. Deliveries of the Ocean are scheduled to begin in 2022.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s87j6bdsfw171.png?width=438&format=png&auto=webp&s=e40add9ce53319d31db242cce73a303afb03cbab

Fisker has also announced a partnership with Electrify America to ensure Fisker Ocean vehicles will integrate seamlessly with Electrify America charging stations when the e-SUV hits the market. With features such as a solar roof and recycled inner materials, it will be, according to Fisker Inc., the ""world's most sustainable vehicle.""

In 2017, Fisker Inc. announced that it had filed patents on flexible solid-state battery designs. Fisker expected the batteries to be produced on a mass scale around 2020. A prototype of the battery debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018. In October 2018, Fisker announced new funding for battery development through Caterpillar Venture Capital. The solid-state batteries are intended to deliver longer vehicle range and faster charging times.

In 2018, Fisker was named to the board of directors of First Cobalt, a North American cobalt refinery that produces battery materials.

In September 2019, it was announced that Fisker Inc. was partnering with Game of Thrones actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who will serve as a partner and sustainability adviser to Fisker, to work on advanced, affordable, electric mobility models.

&#x200B;

[In addition to being a well-known actor, Coster-Waldau is also the United Nations Development Program Goodwill Ambassador for climate change and other social issues.](https://preview.redd.it/3hssff5vfw171.png?width=451&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebe55e2468c5b63d1bc0ac3c71547219dff5afaa)

Nikolaj wrote this piece about Fisker:

To quote a friend of mine who is a lot smarter than me, architect Bjarke Ingels: ‚ÄúThe idea that sustainability needs to sacrifice quality of life is a flawed one. It‚Äôs a design challenge, a challenge to build something that transforms the idea of sustainability into something that will increase the quality of life for all those around it.‚Äù

One person meeting that challenge is Henrik Fisker, who has designed some of the most iconic cars over the past decades for BMW and others, like the BMW Z8, Aston Martin DB9 and Aston Martin V8 Vantage. He‚Äôs a hero for gas-guzzling supercars. He is a fellow Dane, I am a fan, and we met, of all places, on Twitter.

When we met in person, he described his new project ‚Äî an all-electric luxury SUV ‚Äî and asked me if I would help spread the word on his car. The problem as I see it with most electric cars is that they only accomplish the basics. They get you from point A to B. They run electric so you don‚Äôt pollute while driving, but that‚Äôs it. They are basically unattractive combustion engine cars that have a battery thrown into them ‚Äî and for most of them, a battery with a limited range. What Fisker does is to try to make every part of the car in a sustainable and attractive way, like a full-length solar roof, recycled floor mats and vegan leather seats. It looks incredibly cool and inviting, with a great 250- to 300-mile range, and at a cost of just under $40,000, it‚Äôs a luxury car affordable to a mass market.

I said yes and even became an investor, not only because it‚Äôs a great car but more importantly, I hope and believe it can inspire other companies to actively incorporate sustainability goals into all aspects of their business. Fisker then had the idea of calling me ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù adviser. Which I am not. Just to be clear. Thanks Henrik, sounds cool, but I am an actor and a citizen, and that‚Äôs really it.

And what about Hollywood? Is our industry changing, are we at the forefront? Looking at social media, you would think so. And things are happening, but usually only when a camera is pointed at people. Remember a few years back when all awards shows only used EVs for the red carpet? We made a difference. We mattered. We showed the way. So cool. So green, so ‚Ä¶ brief. Now it‚Äôs back to the Escalade. But hey, we are not using plastic straws anymore!

To believe that change will come from Hollywood is not really based in reality (when did that stop us?), but we are great at reacting ‚Äî and things around us are changing, and changing us. I have a good friend who loves his SUV. It‚Äôs not electric. But he cannot give up his car. He is a good guy, he‚Äôs works for the U.N., so if he has a problem going electric, we all do. But if he is presented with an alternative that doesn‚Äôt mean a reduction in his quality of life, something like the Fisker SUV, I think he‚Äôd transition to electric in a heartbeat.

The IPO deal values Fisker Inc at US$2.9 billion, with an IPO share price of $10.

On July 30, 2020, Fisker announced plans for a four-vehicle portfolio by 2025. The Fisker Ocean SUV will be joined by a sports sedan based on their previously announced Fisker Emotion concept, a coupe-like SUV, and a lifestyle pickup truck. All will be electric vehicles.

On October 15, 2020, Fisker Inc announced it would be outsourcing vehicle production of its Fisker Ocean electric SUV to Magna Steyr, to reduce the complexities and costs related to the building and operating its own factory. Magna will start building the Fisker Ocean in Europe in 2022.

## Henrik Fisker Interview quotes:

I have people on Twitter saying, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just make the car next month? You have a prototype.‚Äù Most people don‚Äôt understand that it takes 18 months to do long-lead body tooling for high-volume vehicles. Most people don‚Äôt understand it takes two years to do durability tests and do all the engineering certification and everything else.

And on the business model itself, I believe that there is nobody in the near future or the next couple of years that‚Äôs going to make a million EVs on one model. Today, there‚Äôs nobody doing it. Tesla probably has the highest volume of one single model, a couple hundred thousand. But even the big giant established carmakers are not making, right now, a couple hundred thousand vehicles of one model. So the way you get volume, in my view, is if you partner up with other OEMs and share some of the expensive parts of the platform, which in my view is not anymore something that is unique IP or something that is a unique experience to the customer. An aluminum stamped floor or a steel stamped floor really doesn‚Äôt have any brand value anymore.

And obviously, as we move forward, we always start to do some of the things ourselves. But it was really about de-risking in our first vehicle to market. So we‚Äôre going to do another three vehicles, which we can do because we don‚Äôt have to spend all our money and effort on learning how to manufacture a car, for instance.

So we have programmed a lot. We have hired a head of ESG, environmental and social governance, and he is really spearheading developing specific... we kind of put out some goals that we would like to reach with suppliers, and we at least try to bring them in that direction. They are not reaching those goals right now, but they may reach them later. And then we have goals for ourselves. So for instance, we look at transport. Are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs closer to the plant, or are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs on the other side of the planet that way we have to then transport all that stuff. So those are the types of things that we‚Äôre really thinking about now as we‚Äôre nominating suppliers. And finally, materials as well, looking at sustainable materials. We‚Äôve actually picked up a lot of knowledge on that side as well, where we are adding more sustainable materials to our vehicle. So we are actually looking across everything ‚Äî supply chain, where the suppliers are located, what the suppliers are doing for sustainability, and also then of course in the vehicle itself ‚Äî in terms of the type of materials there.

So - let's summarize - prices are rising at their fastest pace in almost 30 years and incomes just plunged by their most ever! We're gonna need more stimmies!""  

Plus  to above; 

Last year, Hirschman Capital noted that since 1821, 98% of sovereigns that hit 130% debt/GDP have defaulted on their sovereign debt.   

The US hit 130% late last year. 

Simple Conclussion : The Fed can‚Äôt go ‚Äúhawkish‚Äù and raise rates without sending markets ‚Äìand economies‚Äìto their knees; by extension, they now have nothing left to ‚Äúcut‚Äù when the current everything bubble implodes.

And that  is a *real problem*.

 There are only two ways for sovereigns to default: 

Inflation or collapse.    

The latter is not an option. 

 As for a solution, what‚Äôs so tragic is that the only option before the Fed is an even bigger problem‚Äîcurrent and inevitably more inflation. 

 That is, if the Fed wants to keep markets (and their job security) breathing, they no longer have the foregoing template of ‚Äúrate-hike-followed-by-rate-cutting‚Äù at their disposal, which means they now have no choice but to dovishly keep rates near the zero-bound indefinitely.

But the only way to keep rates ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù and nailed to the floor of time is to purchase otherwise unwanted bonds to keep their prices elevated and hence yields and rates repressed.

Such bond ‚Äúaccommodation,‚Äù of course, costs money, and as we already know, the only ‚Äúmoney‚Äù the Fed has to spend is the kind they create out of thin air‚Äì the very kind of money (and policy) which leads to the kind of inflation discussed above‚Äînamely, the brutal kind.

 As for that fake money, the evidence of the Fed‚Äôs desperate (and only) direction is now obvious, as the following M2 money supply makes equally clear. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v774ta55sw171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e73c839beb67a67eea9aed7de4ac61d86813840

 

Fed is so embarrassed by this ‚Äúprinting solution‚Äù that they‚Äôve stopped *weekly* reporting of M2 data, and frankly, since March, have even stopped *monthly* reporting of the same.

That, of course, is both telling as well as disgraceful‚Ä¶ The Fed literally has something to hide, and that never bodes well, does it?

&#x200B;

 The correlation to central bank balance sheet (i.e., money supply) expansion and rising markets is now beyond dispute. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sgizb6xcsw171.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=aad2fe681fe0c49ac20368aba77e86c118b22959

 In short‚Äîdo you see the correlation and pattern? Do you see how the Fed‚Äôs market sausage is made? More importantly, do you now see the Fed‚Äôs self-made conundrum? 

 

Given that the Fed bows to the markets not the people, which choice do you think they‚Äôll make?

In other words, expect more money printing and more yield curve control‚Äîand hence more money creation, more inflation, and by extension more fiat currency debasement.

 More money supply to keep rates monetized simply means more currency debasement and rising inflation.",nn51ou,"""Fed's ""Favorite"" #Inflation Indicator (PCE) Explodes At Fastest Rate Since 1992 As Incomes Crash By Record"""

I have leading indicators telling me that there are two concurrent shifts underway when it comes to who is purchasing homes.

\- Massive increase in unmarried people buying houses alone. This used to be somewhat unusual, now it's becoming very common.

\- Massive increase in unmarried men, in particular, buying houses alone. Traditionally, the female-to-male ratio of unmarried homebuyers was about 5 to 1. For the last 3 months, it's been closer to 50/50.

Source is my own closed real estate purchase transactions. Am a mortgage broker (btw this means cash purchases are ""invisible"" to me). It takes 3-6 months for [HMDA data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Mortgage_Disclosure_Act) to become accessible to journalists and academics, and thus ""visible"" to the general public (assuming journalists deem it worthy of commenting on), but I can see the trends live in real time.

How would one go about placing a bet that in about 3 or 6 months, the media, journalists, academics, etc, will pick up on this, publish articles, and potentially cause a lot of people to buy certain stocks. Which stocks would that be? Is there a ""Mancave, Inc"" out there that would potentially get an uptick? Or maybe a company making smart-home stuff that is particularly suited to renting by the room (the single men are not buying 1 bedroom condos, they are buying proper houses with 3 bedrooms, etc)?

EDIT: oh, and to be clear. It's not just an uptick in single men. It's an uptick in women too, but a massive surge from the men. It used to be that for 15 banana sales, 10 are to married couples, 4 to single women, and 1 to a single man. Now for the same 15 banana sales, it's 6 to married couples, 6 to single women, and 3 to single men, something like that.",nn76we,Homebuyer Demographics Shift towards single and male. How to bet?

7609,,2021-05-28 22:17:57,t3_nn96hb,,wallstreetbets," The AMC squeeze has actually been setup since February. Back in early February when you saw the squeezes of many companies, the two front runners being AMC and GME, they were the literal beginning of and were setting up the actual SHORT squeezes which are going to be never seen before numbers. guys if we go back in time to February just about after the squeezes, the hedge funds had just lost billions and billions after those gamma squeezes(I say gamma cause compared to what AMC is about to do it is nothing) and even after the squeezes they didn't even cover all of their positions(which you'll see why this is the cause of the current mega squeeze), they want to lose the least amount of money as possible so they aren't going to cover ALL of their shorts when the stock is still up around 5x to10x what they would've owed just days before, so they still kept shorting it after the squeeze and got it back down to around $5 per share, NOW, that $5 per share is still double or triple what they would've owed before the squeeze so this scares them, it would still put them in so much debt that they would probably much rather just not live with it so the only fucking thing they could have done was keep shorting the stock to get it down as least as possible to cover their shares as close as possible to the price they expected it to be at(which was very hard to guess but probably around $1-3 per share). The only thing that matters is that they didn't hit that mark and that absolutely fucked them, not going down to $1-3 per share back after the squeeze in February is the reason we are going to see AMC in the hundreds or even thousands by next week. The price not going to where they wanted, caused them to be left holding a bag that they needed and still need to pay eventually, the thing is there's no set date for when they need to cover so they can keep shorting it for as long as possible and try and get the stock down to where they want to cover the rest of the shorts they owed for the least amount of money possible, which i believe was that $1 to $3 mark. so they have been shorting AMC for months and have been doing so drastically since that February squeeze. the thing is they have been the slightest bit successful and that's why we haven't seen the squeeze sooner, AMC has been set to squeeze this whole time since February. if it ran through 15 the hedge funds would know it would take off and this squeeze would happen then and there, and they are trying to get this squeeze to not happen at all. instead you see $15 being tested plenty of times within these months and when it got close, the hedge funds had to short the stock drastically to not go rapidly through $15. we would have seen the squeeze sooner once it went rapidly through $15. However their success of keeping the stock below $15 had triggered them to believe it was still possible to get the stock down past $8 cause their new target price to cover their shorts was below 8 dollars. So the fact that AMC has held within that $8 to $15 range and didn't ever squeeze has caused the hedge funds to keep shorting it for absolutely no reason other than to get it down past $8, and since it hasn't happened for months, they had to short it for months, WELL GUESS WHAT. THEY RAN OUT OF FUCKING SHORT SHARES TO BORROW. THERE ARE 0 SHARES AVAILABLE TO BORROW. THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE. you will not even begin to understand what this causes. this means the hedge funds are having to cover all of the shorts they've been purchasing since February, which is essentially all of the short shares AMC has to offer and they cant borrow any so they HAVE to be payed for. the thing is the hedge funds haven't even begun to pay at all, like have payed 0% of what they owe and the stock has already tripled in just a couple days. the brokers have all the leverage and control over the hedge funds and the hedge funds owe the brokerage and HAVE to pay they cant borrow shorts like they used to anymore cause they bought so much there simply is none left to borrow and it is completely insane and unseen before. I know that no matter what, AMC is is currently worth to be set up at hundreds of dollars even thousands. I had bought in the middle of the last squeeze and have held a $15 per share position since February 2nd because I have know it has always been due to squeeze and there are thousands of people like me that have also known. the thing is that if it were to squeeze before it would be on a much smaller scale than what is about to happen because the hedge funds would have had short shares to borrow. now that there are none to borrow you guys actually don't know what this means for the stock. you can expect it to make one big pull up and a massive sell off before the actual squeeze. for those of you that understand this I know how excited you are but you also have to stay calm and remember how much manipulation there is and even if all the data and analysis is indicating huge gains it could possibly turn out to be huge losses. If i were you guys id take your own time and scale AMC up to the Volkswagen squeeze in 2008 and see how fucking similar they are. Stay safe",nn96hb,r/EAD THIS SHIT

People lose money when they act on emotions instead of sticking to their tested strategy.  Being retarded and just YOLOing on a good stonk and then never selling is an entirely viable strategy.  That's what I did with AAPL, MSFT, BIDU, and GOOG back in like 2008 when the market bottomed out and my basis on those stonks is so low that the market could lose 80% of it's value tomorrow and I'd still have made a profit (if that happened I'd actually just YOLO my entire emergency fund into something and keep holding).

Everything looked to have gone off successfully. We are now waiting on the data and craft to be analysed and inspected. This will take a few weeks according to Michael Colglazier.
That being said he had already outlined the test schedule in the earnings zoom call.

1st test flight - may 
2nd crewed flight - June 
3rd flight with R Branson on board late June/July 

4th flight this will be taking the Italian airforce on a training mission (600k a seat) late July


On the run in to the first test flight some possible maintenance issues appeared with the carrier plane White knight 2‚Ä¶. 
This indeed could have gone either way , after 2 weeks inspections it was decided that WK2 did not need to delay testing no maintenance was needed at this point. Scheduled Maintenance will commence in the fall after all tests have been completed.
Upon this news it is my opinion that the testing programme will go ahead as planned.

The market has responded accordingly and the stock is now up from $17-‚Ç¨31

With all these catalysts lined up before the end of the year and commercial operations looming for early 2022 things are looking up for Virgin Galactic.The success of the last test flight the company have now proven tech and concept.

I had a look at $BB and assume that we finally formed the bottom. In the last few days we saw a sharp rise which might continue in the next weeks. If we can break the 12$ resistance, the next targets would be aroung 25-28$. 

Using Elliot wave theory we are probably at the end of the correction wave 4 and now began with the bullish wave 5.

Price targets:

\#1 12$

\#2 25$

\#3 48$

8020,,2021-05-28 09:17:32,t3_nmtt43,,wallstreetbets,"Trainline has taken a huge dip since the UK government's announcement of the plan to nationalise the railway network. The plan includes creating an online ticketing platform by Great British Railways which might have a huge blow on Trainline revenue. However, this platform does not yet exist and will probably take a couple of years to develop. Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed.

In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales.  Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%.

I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time  for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

This is my first time making a post here, please do give constructive feedback and criticism.

8025,,2021-05-28 10:41:01,t3_nmuzzi,,wallstreetbets,"Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent of Modernas if not more. Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects) 

Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

Imagine if the spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize one piece to understand the whole picture it and helps modify your DNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates it can still recognize the virus. In contrast to using one portion of the picture as it mutates it's easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine, that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. Not only that but they have had the least amount of side effects of any covid vaccine deeming it the safest covid vaccine.... 

And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein (whole picture) and the safety profile. Also worth a mention is that you could store it in a regular refrigerator, and let it sit out in room temperature while you're vaccinating people instead of a special ultra low temp freeze needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers, this is a majority of the world. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines so other protein competitors will be far behind and they will have an a moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing they teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine. They will be combining flu and covid vaccine by 2025 for possibly double the price of current covid vaccine.

 They are pretty much de-risked at this point. Yes you could buy other  biotechs that can go up 20x but are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up) that has all successful trials done so far, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment to where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place there are no more glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""

They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. Yesterday at market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. 
 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

Future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract in there ( in the link below in another message). It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 

I own some $200 July calls along with about 933 shares. I'm all in baby.  Been in since $3.84 I sold once during February a couple months back and got back in a bit too early but I'm diamond hands all the way to $800 from here.  LFG I expect to turn that into over a cool million in a year's time via shares and options

Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. This is huge as the combo is going to differentiate them especially since both flu and covid vaccines are first in class.

But, that is TOTAL Revenue; we need to find out what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike sales...
4) To calculate what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike Sales, we can use numbers from neighboring Q3 (i.e. Three Months Ended March 31, 2019)...
A) On page 6 of the 10-Q, you will find Revenue of ""Connected Fitness Products"" (aka Bike Sales) to be $261.6M

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote... By mid-July, we‚Äôll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase precious metals  especially silver amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative 

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

Gold rose over 60% in the 1930s as the prices of stocks and real estate crashed. You could buy an entire block with a one ounce gold coin. Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms.

I must address Cramer's statement because he is obviously trying to add fuel to the short-selling fire: When he says ""we're not going natural gas"" he is clearly making a vague and general statement meant to be interpreted in the worst possible way: ""no one is going to buy or use natural gas."" By now, I hope everyone that is interested in this stock understands that CLNE offers an alternative transportation fuel, thus, the investments made by BP and Chevron, and not revolutionary technology like some EV's (but this is mostly hype meant to catapult EVs to the front. What most people do not realize is that driverless technology and such can be placed in Petro vehicles too). Also, unfortunately, the company has done a terrible marketting job. That's why powerful analysts can get away with making vague and unsupported statements. The fact that Cramer explained the stock's decrease over the last month as being due to widespread dissaproval is misleading, at best. Many people do not yet know about the cleanliness and therapeutic effects RNG has on the climate.

The News...

If you haven't read yet it looks like Federal Cannabis legalization my be around the corner. [Here](https://www.mpp.org/policy/federal/the-more-act/) is the House Bill. Supporters seem on board and like the reforms they have done to the bill including rescheduling cannabis. [Last time](https://mjbizdaily.com/key-us-house-lawmaker-reintroduces-federal-marijuana-legalization-bill/) the bill was introduced it cleared the House.   


Personally I think this gets a lot of support especially from a fiscal point of view. With stimulus stalling and a giant debate going on about how to pay for the stimulus I think cannabis offers the easiest way to collect federal revenue. A simple review of the bill and the fiscal benefits to the Fed's can be read [here](https://www.justtherealnews.com/congress/nadler-blumenauer-lee-jackson-lee-jeffries-velazquez-reintroduce-comprehensive-marijuana-reform-legislation/). The bill states a 5% fed tax. Money coming for uncle Sam, right when questions about paying for stimulus.... Personally I think it adds up, but that's for you to decide. 

Okay so that's the hype...

Let's talk about the tickers listed ($SNDL and $TLRY). 

$SNDL

I'll start with the cheaper YOLO, $SNDL. $SNDL short interest isn't high, but the company did issue convertible notes a while back around .7c if my memory is correct. I'm not saying they won't do it again, but they should be in a good place fiscally for now. Float is high with about 1.6B shares out there. However today's volume at the time of writing is over 415M. That's not bad given such a high float. It's about 200% more than the average volume. 

The options chain on $SNDL has me giddy. With over 200,000 options currently in the money on todays move above $1 there is some high potential here for some interesting action. The put to call ratio is just obnoxiously low at .08 it's screaming upwards betting. If we hold above $1 the potential squeeze up could be amazing.   


It's also broken up on the trend lines and out of the downward channel it was in. The regression channel from the peak squeeze back in Feb just broke out today according to my crayons I have laying around. 

$TLRY

$TLRY was the squeeze of a lifetime if you remember it back in 19'. The ticker was just a money printer with it's low float and stupid hype. Then they proceeded to do, like they all do, and issue debt. Shares tumbled since then falling from $120 --> $5. Ouch bag holders.   


Like all the cannabis stocks the Feb bump pushed $TLRY to above $60 in an amazing move. $TLRY has a lower short interest than $SNDL, but it also has a much lower float at about 300M. Compared to $SNDL the volume here isn't as good, but still remains decently above the avg volume around 36M as of right now. 

If we peep the options chain we also see a crazy low P/C ratio around .11. But we don't have the Open Interest in the chain like $SNDL does unless you roll out to Jun 18. Then we finally get some decent OI.   


Personally I am going with $SNDL. The option's chain looks better, the stock is cheaper, and the short interest is a little better. My advice would be to roll out till at least the Jun 11th $1 strike to not get eaten alive by Theta and IV crush. But WSB does what WSB wants and that's why I love you all.   
Do not go above the $2 strikes IMO. You will get crushed by theta unless we get an insane move, which could happen but I don't see the risk / reward there.",nn326f,MORE ACT / CANNABIS / $SNDL & $TLRY Potential

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday

>Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers‚Äô attempt to corner the market on the metal.

-
>Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926‚Äì2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers‚Äô Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.

-
>By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged‚ÄîMarch 27‚Äîsilver fell to $10.80, the metal‚Äôs biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, ‚ÄúA billion dollars isn‚Äôt what it used to be,‚Äù the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.

-
>To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978‚Äì91) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities.",nn36fw,There is no silver short squeeze happening.

* Henrik has learned from all the mistakes he made with his previous attempt to create Fisker Automotive, and will certainly do everything in his power to avoid that mess again. He has designed systems into the intricacies of the company to avoid failure - meaning Fisker Inc is guaranteed to succeed

* Large Fleet market in Europe gaining momentum, and 700+ Fisker reservations in this market alone
* 16,000+ reservations already. More than Tesla had 18 months pre-production
* Revenue streams include leasing automotives, servicing, selling emissions credits, selling insurance (like selling the pickaxe to miners, and selling the diamonds to the mine owners too, absolutely genius - Fisker are insuring cars which they own, because the customer is only leasing it)
* High short interest (20%+), high analyst price targets compared to current share price (100%+) and low valuation compared to peers ($3bn market cap currently)
* Designing the first ever all-electric popemobile - Massive, soon to be historic, event!
* I give $FSR (currently $13 a share) a price target of $100 by end of year 2022, if not sooner
* Price Targets: $35 by end of year - Previous ATH. $50 start of next year - European and Chinese debut of prototypes. $100 end of 2022 - start of production (SOP). $150+ 2023
* 2025 Price Targets, calculated using projected data: Bear case - $97 a share, Bull case - $519 a share
* Downside in the short term is capped by the large amount of cash on hand - one third of market cap is cash. Long term, is capped by risk factors, which are almost eligible and affect every automotive startup anyway.

## Fisker Automotive

In 2008, Fisker Automotive raised over $90 million from investors including venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. In September 2009, Fisker Automotive was awarded a $528 million loan guarantee by the United States Department of Energy (DOE). The automaker was one of four recipients of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, to encourage the domestic manufacture of electric cars. The funds were to be used to develop the Karma, as well as an affordable family-size plug-in hybrid car. The loan facility was frozen at $192 million in February 2012, after the DOE claimed that Fisker missed its milestones

In December 2011, just as the Fisker Karma was launched, its battery supplier, A123 Systems, recalled all batteries, followed by a second recall in 2012. A123 filed for bankruptcy in October 2012, leaving Fisker Automotive without a battery supplier. After selling approximately 2,000 units, production of the Fisker Karma was suspended in November 2012, in the absence of its battery supplier.

&#x200B;

Henrik Fisker resigned as chairman from Fisker Automotive in March 2013, because of disagreements with management about business strategy. Later that year, the company declared voluntary bankruptcy.Fisker raised and spent more than a billion dollars over its lifetime.The heart of Fisker‚Äôs business model was in that early deal with Quantum. The idea was to design a gorgeous car, and have suppliers like Quantum provide the technology because off-the-shelf parts from suppliers would help keep costs down.

But there were problems with this strategy: Sometimes, those parts had to be custom-made to fit the design vision, which resulted in higher prices for Fisker. Other times, parts were delivered late or, worse, faulty, but Fisker was locked in to those supplier relationships. Sources close to Fisker have also said that many of the parts were owned by the suppliers themselves, so Fisker didn‚Äôt own a lot of the internal technology.

The broker that raised funds for Fisker automotive, by selling their private shares, was Advanced Equities.It wasn‚Äôt until December 2011 and into 2012 that the more dubious efforts of Advanced Equities became clearer to Fisker‚Äôs hundreds of investors. The last few hundred million dollars of Advanced Equities‚Äô fund raising for Fisker, starting with the D-1 round, was what brokers call ‚Äúpay to play.‚Äù As Fisker was running into technical, delivery and political problems, its valuation was quickly declining. But the company still needed more money, so the brokers went back to its current investors and said: Unless you give this more, your current shares will be diluted and your preferred stock will be converted to common stock.

It was essentially a gun to their heads. This is why investor Wray sued Fisker in February 2012, alleging he was on the receiving end of this tactic. In his lawsuit, he says Advanced Equities sent him a letter dated Jan. 18, 2012, stating that he needed to decide if he wanted to invest in Fisker‚Äôs next round, and pay around $84,000 by Jan. 27, 2012 ‚Äî a little over a week from receiving the letter. He also says that Advanced Equities assured him that he would have anti-dilution protection. According to the audio clip from Advanced Equities‚Äô internal sales call in early 2010, Advanced Equity leaders say that the Fisker deal will ‚Äúsuffer no dilution,‚Äù and was ‚Äúa dream scenario.‚Äù

That dream would soon end. In September 2012 after Fisker closed on $1.2 billion in funding, the bulk of it organized by Advanced Equities, the SEC charged the broker with misleading investors when it raised money for another company back in 2009 and 2010 (Bloom Energy). Advanced settled, agreeing to pay $1 million, and its co-founders were personally fined. Two months later Advanced Equities closed up shop.

Later, A123 Systems itself went bankrupt, causing more problems for Fisker. Fisker claimed that A123 Systems owed it $140 million, but a bankruptcy settlement reduced that to a paltry $15 million.

Then there was the just plain terrible luck for the ironically named Karma: Super Storm Sandy wiped out 338 of its Karmas in storage in New Jersey. The cars first drowned, and then caught on fire ‚Äî salt water damage caused a short circuit that was spread to other cars by high winds, Fisker said at the time.

With all of this happening in public ‚Äî and in a presidential election year ‚Äî Fisker‚Äôs struggles became highly politicized. The company was mentioned numerous times in presidential debates and speeches leading up to the election. Republican nominee Romney called Fisker and other DOE-supported companies losers.

The company didn‚Äôt seem to invest substantially in technology innovation or tech IP, and seemed to spend a disproportionate amount on suppliers. For example, numerous sources have said that the company paid upfront for 15,000 of some of the parts for its planned 15,000 Karmas. It ended up only selling around 2,000 of the cars. It has also been said that Fisker paid some funds upfront to have BMW make engines for the 100,000 Nina cars it hoped to produce ‚Äî in the end, Fisker didn‚Äôt deliver a single Nina.

Costs to build each Karma also creeped up because the company missed its volume targets, and because engineering had to change designs around supplier constraints. The company ended up adding $20,000 to its initial sale price.

Expensive hires may also have sucked away chunks of Fisker‚Äôs funding: Sources say that Fisker filled the upper levels of the company with seasoned auto executives from Detroit. At the high point of Fisker, the company had around 300 employees, plus dozens of contract staff. Bringing in a certain amount of the old guard could help a car startup ramp up quickly, and also impress potential investors with ‚Äúindustry names.‚Äù But those people are also used to big auto-industry budgets that included extensive travel and salaries ‚Äî that‚Äôs the opposite life of a tech startup.

## Fisker Inc.

In July 2016, Henrik Fisker expressed interest in designing a fully connected electric car with autonomous driving features and an aesthetically pleasing look. He has pursued battery technology, and hinted at potentially reviving the Fisker name with a pure-electric vehicle using technology that nobody else has. Since then Fisker has talked about delays to the promised solid state battery technology, which he does not expect to be able to be produced in volume until at least 2025. Posing risk for competition from more scientifically experienced future solid state battery producers such as Quantumscape.

***Forbes:*** ‚ÄúNow he‚Äôs back‚Äìand three things are different. First and foremost, he has a vital new partner: his wife, cofounder and Fisker Inc. CFO Geeta Gupta-Fisker. Second, his Los Angeles-based company is public this time around, raising more than $1 billion in an October 2020 IPO. And finally, Fisker‚Äôs stock price, up 56% since its debut, has made both Henrik and Geeta billionaires, each worth about $1.1 billion as of Friday‚Äôs market close. The auto industry has seen father-son and sibling leadership teams, but Fisker Inc.‚Äôs CEO-CFO combo is the fast-changing sector‚Äôs first husband and wife power couple.‚Äù

Wealth isn‚Äôt the purpose of the new company, Henrik says. ‚ÄúI never got into cars because of money. (This shows he is willing to do what is in the best interest of the company because he is not motivated by money, unlike 99% of other CEO‚Äôs)

The couple sought a big stake in the new venture to ensure they can control its fate in a way Fisker couldn‚Äôt with his earlier company.

Henrik is an auto industry celebrity, but Geeta‚Äôs background is equally impressive. A native of India, she holds multiple degrees in science, including a Ph.D. in biotechnology from Cambridge University where she was also a Research Newton Fellow. From there, she started a career in international investment for Lloyds Banking Group, and then managed investments for a high-net-worth client for several years. (In particular, this is insanely important - Geeta **KNOWS MONEY**! She knows how best to keep a company afloat, organize its share structure, provide value to shareholders, etc. because she has worked in the industry before. She may just be the most important element of Fisker Inc., due to the financial experience she has. At every step of the way, she is likely to make decisions with one sole focus - increasing share price and value).

She met her future husband in 2011 when he was visiting London, just before things started going very wrong at Fisker Automotive. They married in 2012.

‚ÄúWhen I left Fisker Automotive, all I had was my car,‚Äù Henrik remembers. ‚ÄúI'm in a different position, mainly because of Geeta. Because she cuts the deals.‚Äù

To get the new venture off the ground, the Fiskers invested the majority of their life savings‚Äìan enormous financial risk given the fate of Henrik‚Äôs prior company. Then, just as they were locking in plans for the IPO back in July, they were hit by a highly unwelcome complication: Geeta learned she had early-stage breast cancer.

‚ÄúShe got the call (from her doctor) during a call with investors,‚Äù Henrik says. Despite that bombshell, she continued working with banks and investors in the weeks that followed, even as she underwent two surgical procedures and radiation therapy. Her medical therapy concluded in November.

Henrik, who marvels at her fortitude throughout the health crisis says, ‚Äúshe only missed something like one day of work...That's just how she is. She works tirelessly.‚Äù

## Fisker Ocean

The Fisker Ocean will have a nearly 300-mile range with an 80 kWh battery and a solar panel roof as a range extender, adding approximately 1,000 free miles of range per year. Advanced electronics will be housed under the hood, and the vehicle will incorporate recycled and sustainable materials throughout. Deliveries of the Ocean are scheduled to begin in 2022.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s87j6bdsfw171.png?width=438&format=png&auto=webp&s=e40add9ce53319d31db242cce73a303afb03cbab

Fisker has also announced a partnership with Electrify America to ensure Fisker Ocean vehicles will integrate seamlessly with Electrify America charging stations when the e-SUV hits the market. With features such as a solar roof and recycled inner materials, it will be, according to Fisker Inc., the ""world's most sustainable vehicle.""

In 2017, Fisker Inc. announced that it had filed patents on flexible solid-state battery designs. Fisker expected the batteries to be produced on a mass scale around 2020. A prototype of the battery debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018. In October 2018, Fisker announced new funding for battery development through Caterpillar Venture Capital. The solid-state batteries are intended to deliver longer vehicle range and faster charging times.

In 2018, Fisker was named to the board of directors of First Cobalt, a North American cobalt refinery that produces battery materials.

In September 2019, it was announced that Fisker Inc. was partnering with Game of Thrones actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who will serve as a partner and sustainability adviser to Fisker, to work on advanced, affordable, electric mobility models.

&#x200B;

[In addition to being a well-known actor, Coster-Waldau is also the United Nations Development Program Goodwill Ambassador for climate change and other social issues.](https://preview.redd.it/3hssff5vfw171.png?width=451&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebe55e2468c5b63d1bc0ac3c71547219dff5afaa)

Nikolaj wrote this piece about Fisker:

To quote a friend of mine who is a lot smarter than me, architect Bjarke Ingels: ‚ÄúThe idea that sustainability needs to sacrifice quality of life is a flawed one. It‚Äôs a design challenge, a challenge to build something that transforms the idea of sustainability into something that will increase the quality of life for all those around it.‚Äù

One person meeting that challenge is Henrik Fisker, who has designed some of the most iconic cars over the past decades for BMW and others, like the BMW Z8, Aston Martin DB9 and Aston Martin V8 Vantage. He‚Äôs a hero for gas-guzzling supercars. He is a fellow Dane, I am a fan, and we met, of all places, on Twitter.

When we met in person, he described his new project ‚Äî an all-electric luxury SUV ‚Äî and asked me if I would help spread the word on his car. The problem as I see it with most electric cars is that they only accomplish the basics. They get you from point A to B. They run electric so you don‚Äôt pollute while driving, but that‚Äôs it. They are basically unattractive combustion engine cars that have a battery thrown into them ‚Äî and for most of them, a battery with a limited range. What Fisker does is to try to make every part of the car in a sustainable and attractive way, like a full-length solar roof, recycled floor mats and vegan leather seats. It looks incredibly cool and inviting, with a great 250- to 300-mile range, and at a cost of just under $40,000, it‚Äôs a luxury car affordable to a mass market.

I said yes and even became an investor, not only because it‚Äôs a great car but more importantly, I hope and believe it can inspire other companies to actively incorporate sustainability goals into all aspects of their business. Fisker then had the idea of calling me ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù adviser. Which I am not. Just to be clear. Thanks Henrik, sounds cool, but I am an actor and a citizen, and that‚Äôs really it.

And what about Hollywood? Is our industry changing, are we at the forefront? Looking at social media, you would think so. And things are happening, but usually only when a camera is pointed at people. Remember a few years back when all awards shows only used EVs for the red carpet? We made a difference. We mattered. We showed the way. So cool. So green, so ‚Ä¶ brief. Now it‚Äôs back to the Escalade. But hey, we are not using plastic straws anymore!

To believe that change will come from Hollywood is not really based in reality (when did that stop us?), but we are great at reacting ‚Äî and things around us are changing, and changing us. I have a good friend who loves his SUV. It‚Äôs not electric. But he cannot give up his car. He is a good guy, he‚Äôs works for the U.N., so if he has a problem going electric, we all do. But if he is presented with an alternative that doesn‚Äôt mean a reduction in his quality of life, something like the Fisker SUV, I think he‚Äôd transition to electric in a heartbeat.

The IPO deal values Fisker Inc at US$2.9 billion, with an IPO share price of $10.

On July 30, 2020, Fisker announced plans for a four-vehicle portfolio by 2025. The Fisker Ocean SUV will be joined by a sports sedan based on their previously announced Fisker Emotion concept, a coupe-like SUV, and a lifestyle pickup truck. All will be electric vehicles.

On October 15, 2020, Fisker Inc announced it would be outsourcing vehicle production of its Fisker Ocean electric SUV to Magna Steyr, to reduce the complexities and costs related to the building and operating its own factory. Magna will start building the Fisker Ocean in Europe in 2022.

## Henrik Fisker Interview quotes:

I have people on Twitter saying, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just make the car next month? You have a prototype.‚Äù Most people don‚Äôt understand that it takes 18 months to do long-lead body tooling for high-volume vehicles. Most people don‚Äôt understand it takes two years to do durability tests and do all the engineering certification and everything else.

And on the business model itself, I believe that there is nobody in the near future or the next couple of years that‚Äôs going to make a million EVs on one model. Today, there‚Äôs nobody doing it. Tesla probably has the highest volume of one single model, a couple hundred thousand. But even the big giant established carmakers are not making, right now, a couple hundred thousand vehicles of one model. So the way you get volume, in my view, is if you partner up with other OEMs and share some of the expensive parts of the platform, which in my view is not anymore something that is unique IP or something that is a unique experience to the customer. An aluminum stamped floor or a steel stamped floor really doesn‚Äôt have any brand value anymore.

And obviously, as we move forward, we always start to do some of the things ourselves. But it was really about de-risking in our first vehicle to market. So we‚Äôre going to do another three vehicles, which we can do because we don‚Äôt have to spend all our money and effort on learning how to manufacture a car, for instance.

So we have programmed a lot. We have hired a head of ESG, environmental and social governance, and he is really spearheading developing specific... we kind of put out some goals that we would like to reach with suppliers, and we at least try to bring them in that direction. They are not reaching those goals right now, but they may reach them later. And then we have goals for ourselves. So for instance, we look at transport. Are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs closer to the plant, or are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs on the other side of the planet that way we have to then transport all that stuff. So those are the types of things that we‚Äôre really thinking about now as we‚Äôre nominating suppliers. And finally, materials as well, looking at sustainable materials. We‚Äôve actually picked up a lot of knowledge on that side as well, where we are adding more sustainable materials to our vehicle. So we are actually looking across everything ‚Äî supply chain, where the suppliers are located, what the suppliers are doing for sustainability, and also then of course in the vehicle itself ‚Äî in terms of the type of materials there.

So - let's summarize - prices are rising at their fastest pace in almost 30 years and incomes just plunged by their most ever! We're gonna need more stimmies!""  

Plus  to above; 

Last year, Hirschman Capital noted that since 1821, 98% of sovereigns that hit 130% debt/GDP have defaulted on their sovereign debt.   

The US hit 130% late last year. 

Simple Conclussion : The Fed can‚Äôt go ‚Äúhawkish‚Äù and raise rates without sending markets ‚Äìand economies‚Äìto their knees; by extension, they now have nothing left to ‚Äúcut‚Äù when the current everything bubble implodes.

And that  is a *real problem*.

 There are only two ways for sovereigns to default: 

Inflation or collapse.    

The latter is not an option. 

 As for a solution, what‚Äôs so tragic is that the only option before the Fed is an even bigger problem‚Äîcurrent and inevitably more inflation. 

 That is, if the Fed wants to keep markets (and their job security) breathing, they no longer have the foregoing template of ‚Äúrate-hike-followed-by-rate-cutting‚Äù at their disposal, which means they now have no choice but to dovishly keep rates near the zero-bound indefinitely.

But the only way to keep rates ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù and nailed to the floor of time is to purchase otherwise unwanted bonds to keep their prices elevated and hence yields and rates repressed.

Such bond ‚Äúaccommodation,‚Äù of course, costs money, and as we already know, the only ‚Äúmoney‚Äù the Fed has to spend is the kind they create out of thin air‚Äì the very kind of money (and policy) which leads to the kind of inflation discussed above‚Äînamely, the brutal kind.

 As for that fake money, the evidence of the Fed‚Äôs desperate (and only) direction is now obvious, as the following M2 money supply makes equally clear. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v774ta55sw171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e73c839beb67a67eea9aed7de4ac61d86813840

 

Fed is so embarrassed by this ‚Äúprinting solution‚Äù that they‚Äôve stopped *weekly* reporting of M2 data, and frankly, since March, have even stopped *monthly* reporting of the same.

That, of course, is both telling as well as disgraceful‚Ä¶ The Fed literally has something to hide, and that never bodes well, does it?

&#x200B;

 The correlation to central bank balance sheet (i.e., money supply) expansion and rising markets is now beyond dispute. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sgizb6xcsw171.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=aad2fe681fe0c49ac20368aba77e86c118b22959

 In short‚Äîdo you see the correlation and pattern? Do you see how the Fed‚Äôs market sausage is made? More importantly, do you now see the Fed‚Äôs self-made conundrum? 

 

Given that the Fed bows to the markets not the people, which choice do you think they‚Äôll make?

In other words, expect more money printing and more yield curve control‚Äîand hence more money creation, more inflation, and by extension more fiat currency debasement.

 More money supply to keep rates monetized simply means more currency debasement and rising inflation.",nn51ou,"""Fed's ""Favorite"" #Inflation Indicator (PCE) Explodes At Fastest Rate Since 1992 As Incomes Crash By Record"""

I have leading indicators telling me that there are two concurrent shifts underway when it comes to who is purchasing homes.

\- Massive increase in unmarried people buying houses alone. This used to be somewhat unusual, now it's becoming very common.

\- Massive increase in unmarried men, in particular, buying houses alone. Traditionally, the female-to-male ratio of unmarried homebuyers was about 5 to 1. For the last 3 months, it's been closer to 50/50.

Source is my own closed real estate purchase transactions. Am a mortgage broker (btw this means cash purchases are ""invisible"" to me). It takes 3-6 months for [HMDA data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Mortgage_Disclosure_Act) to become accessible to journalists and academics, and thus ""visible"" to the general public (assuming journalists deem it worthy of commenting on), but I can see the trends live in real time.

How would one go about placing a bet that in about 3 or 6 months, the media, journalists, academics, etc, will pick up on this, publish articles, and potentially cause a lot of people to buy certain stocks. Which stocks would that be? Is there a ""Mancave, Inc"" out there that would potentially get an uptick? Or maybe a company making smart-home stuff that is particularly suited to renting by the room (the single men are not buying 1 bedroom condos, they are buying proper houses with 3 bedrooms, etc)?

EDIT: oh, and to be clear. It's not just an uptick in single men. It's an uptick in women too, but a massive surge from the men. It used to be that for 15 banana sales, 10 are to married couples, 4 to single women, and 1 to a single man. Now for the same 15 banana sales, it's 6 to married couples, 6 to single women, and 3 to single men, something like that.",nn76we,Homebuyer Demographics Shift towards single and male. How to bet?

What did everyone see three months ago with the initial squeeze?

8075,,2021-05-28 22:17:57,t3_nn96hb,,wallstreetbets," The AMC squeeze has actually been setup since February. Back in early February when you saw the squeezes of many companies, the two front runners being AMC and GME, they were the literal beginning of and were setting up the actual SHORT squeezes which are going to be never seen before numbers. guys if we go back in time to February just about after the squeezes, the hedge funds had just lost billions and billions after those gamma squeezes(I say gamma cause compared to what AMC is about to do it is nothing) and even after the squeezes they didn't even cover all of their positions(which you'll see why this is the cause of the current mega squeeze), they want to lose the least amount of money as possible so they aren't going to cover ALL of their shorts when the stock is still up around 5x to10x what they would've owed just days before, so they still kept shorting it after the squeeze and got it back down to around $5 per share, NOW, that $5 per share is still double or triple what they would've owed before the squeeze so this scares them, it would still put them in so much debt that they would probably much rather just not live with it so the only fucking thing they could have done was keep shorting the stock to get it down as least as possible to cover their shares as close as possible to the price they expected it to be at(which was very hard to guess but probably around $1-3 per share). The only thing that matters is that they didn't hit that mark and that absolutely fucked them, not going down to $1-3 per share back after the squeeze in February is the reason we are going to see AMC in the hundreds or even thousands by next week. The price not going to where they wanted, caused them to be left holding a bag that they needed and still need to pay eventually, the thing is there's no set date for when they need to cover so they can keep shorting it for as long as possible and try and get the stock down to where they want to cover the rest of the shorts they owed for the least amount of money possible, which i believe was that $1 to $3 mark. so they have been shorting AMC for months and have been doing so drastically since that February squeeze. the thing is they have been the slightest bit successful and that's why we haven't seen the squeeze sooner, AMC has been set to squeeze this whole time since February. if it ran through 15 the hedge funds would know it would take off and this squeeze would happen then and there, and they are trying to get this squeeze to not happen at all. instead you see $15 being tested plenty of times within these months and when it got close, the hedge funds had to short the stock drastically to not go rapidly through $15. we would have seen the squeeze sooner once it went rapidly through $15. However their success of keeping the stock below $15 had triggered them to believe it was still possible to get the stock down past $8 cause their new target price to cover their shorts was below 8 dollars. So the fact that AMC has held within that $8 to $15 range and didn't ever squeeze has caused the hedge funds to keep shorting it for absolutely no reason other than to get it down past $8, and since it hasn't happened for months, they had to short it for months, WELL GUESS WHAT. THEY RAN OUT OF FUCKING SHORT SHARES TO BORROW. THERE ARE 0 SHARES AVAILABLE TO BORROW. THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE. you will not even begin to understand what this causes. this means the hedge funds are having to cover all of the shorts they've been purchasing since February, which is essentially all of the short shares AMC has to offer and they cant borrow any so they HAVE to be payed for. the thing is the hedge funds haven't even begun to pay at all, like have payed 0% of what they owe and the stock has already tripled in just a couple days. the brokers have all the leverage and control over the hedge funds and the hedge funds owe the brokerage and HAVE to pay they cant borrow shorts like they used to anymore cause they bought so much there simply is none left to borrow and it is completely insane and unseen before. I know that no matter what, AMC is is currently worth to be set up at hundreds of dollars even thousands. I had bought in the middle of the last squeeze and have held a $15 per share position since February 2nd because I have know it has always been due to squeeze and there are thousands of people like me that have also known. the thing is that if it were to squeeze before it would be on a much smaller scale than what is about to happen because the hedge funds would have had short shares to borrow. now that there are none to borrow you guys actually don't know what this means for the stock. you can expect it to make one big pull up and a massive sell off before the actual squeeze. for those of you that understand this I know how excited you are but you also have to stay calm and remember how much manipulation there is and even if all the data and analysis is indicating huge gains it could possibly turn out to be huge losses. If i were you guys id take your own time and scale AMC up to the Volkswagen squeeze in 2008 and see how fucking similar they are. Stay safe",nn96hb,r/EAD THIS SHIT

I originally bought 737 shares for a lil for about $2,992 @ $4.06. I've added a lil over 200 shares since then and occasionally sell 5-10% to buy options. Since the GME Robinhood incident where they restricted selling, I ditched Robinhood and got a Ameritrade account and never looked back. That pissed me off because they also restricted Nvax on the day it biggest gains of the year. Anyway my autistic ass paniƒá sold in the February market crash to rebuy a falling knife and get a wash sale üôà. I know, I know bonehead move. So my wash sale got added to my position and gonna pay the taxman a nice visit next year. But over all not bad about $6k invested and I'm sitting at $139,720 altogether now with options and stocks. Could be worse could be better but I'mma take it with a chip on my shoulder and get ready for round 2. With all their contracts this will moon to $800 easy over the next year or so. DD is easy 7x from here so lm not selling untill then $1,000,000!",,

Now, if you want to expand that knowledge and learn more go on youtube and just watch some videos on options or Google it if you prefer reading. Search for ""options greeks"" and also just look for a video on the basics of options. Once you get this you can watch so many videos about different options strategies like covered calls, spreads, cash secured puts, etc. 

 Best thing in my opinion to follow this up is to sign up for TDAmeritrade and download Think or Swim (TOS). If you then sign into paper trading It allows you to trade stocks and options just like you would normally, but the money is fake, so you can practice any strategy or test trades you think are good to see if you're right.

8708,gztd5ez,2021-05-28 23:15:45,t1_gztd5ez,t1_gzrraz4,wallstreetbets,"I don't trust any of these analysts. With AMC, for example, most analysts were saying to sell, that it's only worth $2/share (when it was at like $8). And I was like well shit, and eventually succumbed to the groupthink and sold all mine for a small loss. If I'd ignored the ""experts"" I would be up pretty big today. 

Same with BB. Last month I sold 75% of my shares after all the analysts suddenly downgraded it from bullish to bearish (the dumb little Fidelity analyst scores on the positions page went from like 8.2 ""GOOD BUY"" to 2.0 ""SELL NOW"" like overnight). I basically broke even selling at \~8.50 but again, if I'd just ignored the BS I would be up like over 10% on those shares right now. 

I'm no longer giving these analyst ratings any credence. Plus it's the financial sector anyway, lots of money at stake and so much abstraction, who knows what fuckery is really going on. Maybe it was in some powerful player's interest for more people to sell the stock so some analysts got paid off to tell people to sell, and vwa-la; share price goes down and they can swoop in and get a free discount on bulk shares. Then later change the rating to a ""MUST BUY"" and watch the price go back up, sell for profit. Maybe that's just overly paranoid on my part but really it wouldn't be that hard to make serious money by just advertising some ""experts"" opinion to sway public behavior on a stock. But that aside, I've already missed out on profits twice now by acting on analysts' opinions instead of my own. Analysts also said GME wasn't worth shit, just about every single one of them was wrong",,

I had a look at $BB and assume that we finally formed the bottom. In the last few days we saw a sharp rise which might continue in the next weeks. If we can break the 12$ resistance, the next targets would be aroung 25-28$. 

Using Elliot wave theory we are probably at the end of the correction wave 4 and now began with the bullish wave 5.

Price targets:

\#1 12$

\#2 25$

\#3 48$

The risk/reward is worth entering a trade here. I bought yesterday around 10$. My stop loss is below 8$.

8862,,2021-05-28 09:17:32,t3_nmtt43,,wallstreetbets,"Trainline has taken a huge dip since the UK government's announcement of the plan to nationalise the railway network. The plan includes creating an online ticketing platform by Great British Railways which might have a huge blow on Trainline revenue. However, this platform does not yet exist and will probably take a couple of years to develop. Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed.

In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales.  Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%.

I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time  for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

This is my first time making a post here, please do give constructive feedback and criticism.

8867,,2021-05-28 10:41:01,t3_nmuzzi,,wallstreetbets,"Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent of Modernas if not more. Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects) 

Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

Imagine if the spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize one piece to understand the whole picture it and helps modify your DNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates it can still recognize the virus. In contrast to using one portion of the picture as it mutates it's easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine, that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. Not only that but they have had the least amount of side effects of any covid vaccine deeming it the safest covid vaccine.... 

And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein (whole picture) and the safety profile. Also worth a mention is that you could store it in a regular refrigerator, and let it sit out in room temperature while you're vaccinating people instead of a special ultra low temp freeze needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers, this is a majority of the world. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines so other protein competitors will be far behind and they will have an a moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing they teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine. They will be combining flu and covid vaccine by 2025 for possibly double the price of current covid vaccine.

 They are pretty much de-risked at this point. Yes you could buy other  biotechs that can go up 20x but are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up) that has all successful trials done so far, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment to where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place there are no more glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""

They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. Yesterday at market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. 
 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

Future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract in there ( in the link below in another message). It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 

I own some $200 July calls along with about 933 shares. I'm all in baby.  Been in since $3.84 I sold once during February a couple months back and got back in a bit too early but I'm diamond hands all the way to $800 from here.  LFG I expect to turn that into over a cool million in a year's time via shares and options

Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. This is huge as the combo is going to differentiate them especially since both flu and covid vaccines are first in class.

Vol Trigger: Increased to 419 (Important support and resistance level. (above this level = lower volatility and a more stable stock price.)

Abs Gamma Strike: Unchanged

Gamma Notional: Decreased to $-516 (stock has larger put gamma position. A negative gamma position implies higher volatility in the underlying)

Call Wall Strike: Increased to 425 (When this strike is rolled higher it is generally considered bullish)

Gamma Tilt: Decreased to 0.88	 (when decreasing it‚Äôs a bearish signal.)

But, that is TOTAL Revenue; we need to find out what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike sales...
4) To calculate what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike Sales, we can use numbers from neighboring Q3 (i.e. Three Months Ended March 31, 2019)...
A) On page 6 of the 10-Q, you will find Revenue of ""Connected Fitness Products"" (aka Bike Sales) to be $261.6M
B) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $316.7M
C) % of Bike Sales per TOTAL Revenue: $261.6M / $316.7M * 100 = 82.6% {""Connected Fitness Products"" Revenue (aka Bike Sales)}
5) Apply 82.6% to the TOTAL Revenue $223.3M for Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19): $223.3M x 0.826 = $184.45M {Bike Sales for Q4 of fiscal '19}

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote... By mid-July, we‚Äôll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase precious metals  especially silver amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative 

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

Gold rose over 60% in the 1930s as the prices of stocks and real estate crashed. You could buy an entire block with a one ounce gold coin. Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms.

I must address Cramer's statement because he is obviously trying to add fuel to the short-selling fire: When he says ""we're not going natural gas"" he is clearly making a vague and general statement meant to be interpreted in the worst possible way: ""no one is going to buy or use natural gas."" By now, I hope everyone that is interested in this stock understands that CLNE offers an alternative transportation fuel, thus, the investments made by BP and Chevron, and not revolutionary technology like some EV's (but this is mostly hype meant to catapult EVs to the front. What most people do not realize is that driverless technology and such can be placed in Petro vehicles too). Also, unfortunately, the company has done a terrible marketting job. That's why powerful analysts can get away with making vague and unsupported statements. The fact that Cramer explained the stock's decrease over the last month as being due to widespread dissaproval is misleading, at best. Many people do not yet know about the cleanliness and therapeutic effects RNG has on the climate. We must get the word out and pressure CLNE corporate to begin marketting campaigns to get the word out. I think it's about time.",nn0whs,Cramer on CLNE

The News...

If you haven't read yet it looks like Federal Cannabis legalization my be around the corner. [Here](https://www.mpp.org/policy/federal/the-more-act/) is the House Bill. Supporters seem on board and like the reforms they have done to the bill including rescheduling cannabis. [Last time](https://mjbizdaily.com/key-us-house-lawmaker-reintroduces-federal-marijuana-legalization-bill/) the bill was introduced it cleared the House.   


Personally I think this gets a lot of support especially from a fiscal point of view. With stimulus stalling and a giant debate going on about how to pay for the stimulus I think cannabis offers the easiest way to collect federal revenue. A simple review of the bill and the fiscal benefits to the Fed's can be read [here](https://www.justtherealnews.com/congress/nadler-blumenauer-lee-jackson-lee-jeffries-velazquez-reintroduce-comprehensive-marijuana-reform-legislation/). The bill states a 5% fed tax. Money coming for uncle Sam, right when questions about paying for stimulus.... Personally I think it adds up, but that's for you to decide. 

Okay so that's the hype...

Let's talk about the tickers listed ($SNDL and $TLRY). 

$SNDL

I'll start with the cheaper YOLO, $SNDL. $SNDL short interest isn't high, but the company did issue convertible notes a while back around .7c if my memory is correct. I'm not saying they won't do it again, but they should be in a good place fiscally for now. Float is high with about 1.6B shares out there. However today's volume at the time of writing is over 415M. That's not bad given such a high float. It's about 200% more than the average volume. 

The options chain on $SNDL has me giddy. With over 200,000 options currently in the money on todays move above $1 there is some high potential here for some interesting action. The put to call ratio is just obnoxiously low at .08 it's screaming upwards betting. If we hold above $1 the potential squeeze up could be amazing.   


It's also broken up on the trend lines and out of the downward channel it was in. The regression channel from the peak squeeze back in Feb just broke out today according to my crayons I have laying around. 

$TLRY

$TLRY was the squeeze of a lifetime if you remember it back in 19'. The ticker was just a money printer with it's low float and stupid hype. Then they proceeded to do, like they all do, and issue debt. Shares tumbled since then falling from $120 --> $5. Ouch bag holders.   


Like all the cannabis stocks the Feb bump pushed $TLRY to above $60 in an amazing move. $TLRY has a lower short interest than $SNDL, but it also has a much lower float at about 300M. Compared to $SNDL the volume here isn't as good, but still remains decently above the avg volume around 36M as of right now. 

If we peep the options chain we also see a crazy low P/C ratio around .11. But we don't have the Open Interest in the chain like $SNDL does unless you roll out to Jun 18. Then we finally get some decent OI.   


Personally I am going with $SNDL. The option's chain looks better, the stock is cheaper, and the short interest is a little better. My advice would be to roll out till at least the Jun 11th $1 strike to not get eaten alive by Theta and IV crush. But WSB does what WSB wants and that's why I love you all.   
Do not go above the $2 strikes IMO. You will get crushed by theta unless we get an insane move, which could happen but I don't see the risk / reward there.",nn326f,MORE ACT / CANNABIS / $SNDL & $TLRY Potential

>A corner in the silver market has been tried before - and let's be clear, that is what is being attempted now.  In 1980, a rule change by the government destroyed the corner.  #silverthursday.

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday

>Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers‚Äô attempt to corner the market on the metal.

-
>Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926‚Äì2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers‚Äô Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.

-
>By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged‚ÄîMarch 27‚Äîsilver fell to $10.80, the metal‚Äôs biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, ‚ÄúA billion dollars isn‚Äôt what it used to be,‚Äù the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.

-
>To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978‚Äì91) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities.",nn36fw,There is no silver short squeeze happening.

* Geeta Gupta-Fisker is a solid Chief Financial Officer with experience in investment banking - she will ensure the shares are valued right
* Henrik has learned from all the mistakes he made with his previous attempt to create Fisker Automotive, and will certainly do everything in his power to avoid that mess again. He has designed systems into the intricacies of the company to avoid failure - meaning Fisker Inc is guaranteed to succeed
* Henrik Fisker on shorting $FSR - ‚ÄúYou will quickly understand that you stand to lose a lot of money if you show it against Fisker‚Äù
* Production of Fisker Ocean expected to start in November 2022
* 250,000+ units a year expected by 2025
* Partnerships with Foxconn and Magna Steyr, both giants in their respective industries, among others
* Large Fleet market in Europe gaining momentum, and 700+ Fisker reservations in this market alone
* 16,000+ reservations already. More than Tesla had 18 months pre-production
* Revenue streams include leasing automotives, servicing, selling emissions credits, selling insurance (like selling the pickaxe to miners, and selling the diamonds to the mine owners too, absolutely genius - Fisker are insuring cars which they own, because the customer is only leasing it)
* High short interest (20%+), high analyst price targets compared to current share price (100%+) and low valuation compared to peers ($3bn market cap currently)
* Designing the first ever all-electric popemobile - Massive, soon to be historic, event!
* I give $FSR (currently $13 a share) a price target of $100 by end of year 2022, if not sooner
* Price Targets: $35 by end of year - Previous ATH. $50 start of next year - European and Chinese debut of prototypes. $100 end of 2022 - start of production (SOP). $150+ 2023
* 2025 Price Targets, calculated using projected data: Bear case - $97 a share, Bull case - $519 a share
* Downside in the short term is capped by the large amount of cash on hand - one third of market cap is cash. Long term, is capped by risk factors, which are almost eligible and affect every automotive startup anyway.

## Fisker Automotive

In 2008, Fisker Automotive raised over $90 million from investors including venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. In September 2009, Fisker Automotive was awarded a $528 million loan guarantee by the United States Department of Energy (DOE). The automaker was one of four recipients of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, to encourage the domestic manufacture of electric cars. The funds were to be used to develop the Karma, as well as an affordable family-size plug-in hybrid car. The loan facility was frozen at $192 million in February 2012, after the DOE claimed that Fisker missed its milestones

In December 2011, just as the Fisker Karma was launched, its battery supplier, A123 Systems, recalled all batteries, followed by a second recall in 2012. A123 filed for bankruptcy in October 2012, leaving Fisker Automotive without a battery supplier. After selling approximately 2,000 units, production of the Fisker Karma was suspended in November 2012, in the absence of its battery supplier.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/59vfj5wa8w171.png?width=511&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1c03d1e1254fea00c195776122de2b26099dd35

Henrik Fisker resigned as chairman from Fisker Automotive in March 2013, because of disagreements with management about business strategy. Later that year, the company declared voluntary bankruptcy.Fisker raised and spent more than a billion dollars over its lifetime.The heart of Fisker‚Äôs business model was in that early deal with Quantum. The idea was to design a gorgeous car, and have suppliers like Quantum provide the technology because off-the-shelf parts from suppliers would help keep costs down.

But there were problems with this strategy: Sometimes, those parts had to be custom-made to fit the design vision, which resulted in higher prices for Fisker. Other times, parts were delivered late or, worse, faulty, but Fisker was locked in to those supplier relationships. Sources close to Fisker have also said that many of the parts were owned by the suppliers themselves, so Fisker didn‚Äôt own a lot of the internal technology.

The broker that raised funds for Fisker automotive, by selling their private shares, was Advanced Equities.It wasn‚Äôt until December 2011 and into 2012 that the more dubious efforts of Advanced Equities became clearer to Fisker‚Äôs hundreds of investors. The last few hundred million dollars of Advanced Equities‚Äô fund raising for Fisker, starting with the D-1 round, was what brokers call ‚Äúpay to play.‚Äù As Fisker was running into technical, delivery and political problems, its valuation was quickly declining. But the company still needed more money, so the brokers went back to its current investors and said: Unless you give this more, your current shares will be diluted and your preferred stock will be converted to common stock.

It was essentially a gun to their heads. This is why investor Wray sued Fisker in February 2012, alleging he was on the receiving end of this tactic. In his lawsuit, he says Advanced Equities sent him a letter dated Jan. 18, 2012, stating that he needed to decide if he wanted to invest in Fisker‚Äôs next round, and pay around $84,000 by Jan. 27, 2012 ‚Äî a little over a week from receiving the letter. He also says that Advanced Equities assured him that he would have anti-dilution protection. According to the audio clip from Advanced Equities‚Äô internal sales call in early 2010, Advanced Equity leaders say that the Fisker deal will ‚Äúsuffer no dilution,‚Äù and was ‚Äúa dream scenario.‚Äù

That dream would soon end. In September 2012 after Fisker closed on $1.2 billion in funding, the bulk of it organized by Advanced Equities, the SEC charged the broker with misleading investors when it raised money for another company back in 2009 and 2010 (Bloom Energy). Advanced settled, agreeing to pay $1 million, and its co-founders were personally fined. Two months later Advanced Equities closed up shop.

Later, A123 Systems itself went bankrupt, causing more problems for Fisker. Fisker claimed that A123 Systems owed it $140 million, but a bankruptcy settlement reduced that to a paltry $15 million.

Then there was the just plain terrible luck for the ironically named Karma: Super Storm Sandy wiped out 338 of its Karmas in storage in New Jersey. The cars first drowned, and then caught on fire ‚Äî salt water damage caused a short circuit that was spread to other cars by high winds, Fisker said at the time.

With all of this happening in public ‚Äî and in a presidential election year ‚Äî Fisker‚Äôs struggles became highly politicized. The company was mentioned numerous times in presidential debates and speeches leading up to the election. Republican nominee Romney called Fisker and other DOE-supported companies losers.

The company didn‚Äôt seem to invest substantially in technology innovation or tech IP, and seemed to spend a disproportionate amount on suppliers. For example, numerous sources have said that the company paid upfront for 15,000 of some of the parts for its planned 15,000 Karmas. It ended up only selling around 2,000 of the cars. It has also been said that Fisker paid some funds upfront to have BMW make engines for the 100,000 Nina cars it hoped to produce ‚Äî in the end, Fisker didn‚Äôt deliver a single Nina.

Costs to build each Karma also creeped up because the company missed its volume targets, and because engineering had to change designs around supplier constraints. The company ended up adding $20,000 to its initial sale price.

Expensive hires may also have sucked away chunks of Fisker‚Äôs funding: Sources say that Fisker filled the upper levels of the company with seasoned auto executives from Detroit. At the high point of Fisker, the company had around 300 employees, plus dozens of contract staff. Bringing in a certain amount of the old guard could help a car startup ramp up quickly, and also impress potential investors with ‚Äúindustry names.‚Äù But those people are also used to big auto-industry budgets that included extensive travel and salaries ‚Äî that‚Äôs the opposite life of a tech startup.

## Fisker Inc.

In July 2016, Henrik Fisker expressed interest in designing a fully connected electric car with autonomous driving features and an aesthetically pleasing look. He has pursued battery technology, and hinted at potentially reviving the Fisker name with a pure-electric vehicle using technology that nobody else has. Since then Fisker has talked about delays to the promised solid state battery technology, which he does not expect to be able to be produced in volume until at least 2025. Posing risk for competition from more scientifically experienced future solid state battery producers such as Quantumscape.

***Forbes:*** ‚ÄúNow he‚Äôs back‚Äìand three things are different. First and foremost, he has a vital new partner: his wife, cofounder and Fisker Inc. CFO Geeta Gupta-Fisker. Second, his Los Angeles-based company is public this time around, raising more than $1 billion in an October 2020 IPO. And finally, Fisker‚Äôs stock price, up 56% since its debut, has made both Henrik and Geeta billionaires, each worth about $1.1 billion as of Friday‚Äôs market close. The auto industry has seen father-son and sibling leadership teams, but Fisker Inc.‚Äôs CEO-CFO combo is the fast-changing sector‚Äôs first husband and wife power couple.‚Äù

Wealth isn‚Äôt the purpose of the new company, Henrik says. ‚ÄúI never got into cars because of money. (This shows he is willing to do what is in the best interest of the company because he is not motivated by money, unlike 99% of other CEO‚Äôs)

The couple sought a big stake in the new venture to ensure they can control its fate in a way Fisker couldn‚Äôt with his earlier company.

Henrik is an auto industry celebrity, but Geeta‚Äôs background is equally impressive. A native of India, she holds multiple degrees in science, including a Ph.D. in biotechnology from Cambridge University where she was also a Research Newton Fellow. From there, she started a career in international investment for Lloyds Banking Group, and then managed investments for a high-net-worth client for several years. (In particular, this is insanely important - Geeta **KNOWS MONEY**! She knows how best to keep a company afloat, organize its share structure, provide value to shareholders, etc. because she has worked in the industry before. She may just be the most important element of Fisker Inc., due to the financial experience she has. At every step of the way, she is likely to make decisions with one sole focus - increasing share price and value).

She met her future husband in 2011 when he was visiting London, just before things started going very wrong at Fisker Automotive. They married in 2012.

‚ÄúWhen I left Fisker Automotive, all I had was my car,‚Äù Henrik remembers. ‚ÄúI'm in a different position, mainly because of Geeta. Because she cuts the deals.‚Äù

To get the new venture off the ground, the Fiskers invested the majority of their life savings‚Äìan enormous financial risk given the fate of Henrik‚Äôs prior company. Then, just as they were locking in plans for the IPO back in July, they were hit by a highly unwelcome complication: Geeta learned she had early-stage breast cancer.

‚ÄúShe got the call (from her doctor) during a call with investors,‚Äù Henrik says. Despite that bombshell, she continued working with banks and investors in the weeks that followed, even as she underwent two surgical procedures and radiation therapy. Her medical therapy concluded in November.

Henrik, who marvels at her fortitude throughout the health crisis says, ‚Äúshe only missed something like one day of work...That's just how she is. She works tirelessly.‚Äù

## Fisker Ocean

The Fisker Ocean will have a nearly 300-mile range with an 80 kWh battery and a solar panel roof as a range extender, adding approximately 1,000 free miles of range per year. Advanced electronics will be housed under the hood, and the vehicle will incorporate recycled and sustainable materials throughout. Deliveries of the Ocean are scheduled to begin in 2022.

&#x200B;

Fisker has also announced a partnership with Electrify America to ensure Fisker Ocean vehicles will integrate seamlessly with Electrify America charging stations when the e-SUV hits the market. With features such as a solar roof and recycled inner materials, it will be, according to Fisker Inc., the ""world's most sustainable vehicle.""

In 2017, Fisker Inc. announced that it had filed patents on flexible solid-state battery designs. Fisker expected the batteries to be produced on a mass scale around 2020. A prototype of the battery debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018. In October 2018, Fisker announced new funding for battery development through Caterpillar Venture Capital. The solid-state batteries are intended to deliver longer vehicle range and faster charging times.

In 2018, Fisker was named to the board of directors of First Cobalt, a North American cobalt refinery that produces battery materials.

In September 2019, it was announced that Fisker Inc. was partnering with Game of Thrones actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who will serve as a partner and sustainability adviser to Fisker, to work on advanced, affordable, electric mobility models.

&#x200B;

[In addition to being a well-known actor, Coster-Waldau is also the United Nations Development Program Goodwill Ambassador for climate change and other social issues.](https://preview.redd.it/3hssff5vfw171.png?width=451&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebe55e2468c5b63d1bc0ac3c71547219dff5afaa)

Nikolaj wrote this piece about Fisker:

To quote a friend of mine who is a lot smarter than me, architect Bjarke Ingels: ‚ÄúThe idea that sustainability needs to sacrifice quality of life is a flawed one. It‚Äôs a design challenge, a challenge to build something that transforms the idea of sustainability into something that will increase the quality of life for all those around it.‚Äù

One person meeting that challenge is Henrik Fisker, who has designed some of the most iconic cars over the past decades for BMW and others, like the BMW Z8, Aston Martin DB9 and Aston Martin V8 Vantage. He‚Äôs a hero for gas-guzzling supercars. He is a fellow Dane, I am a fan, and we met, of all places, on Twitter.

When we met in person, he described his new project ‚Äî an all-electric luxury SUV ‚Äî and asked me if I would help spread the word on his car. The problem as I see it with most electric cars is that they only accomplish the basics. They get you from point A to B. They run electric so you don‚Äôt pollute while driving, but that‚Äôs it. They are basically unattractive combustion engine cars that have a battery thrown into them ‚Äî and for most of them, a battery with a limited range. What Fisker does is to try to make every part of the car in a sustainable and attractive way, like a full-length solar roof, recycled floor mats and vegan leather seats. It looks incredibly cool and inviting, with a great 250- to 300-mile range, and at a cost of just under $40,000, it‚Äôs a luxury car affordable to a mass market.

I said yes and even became an investor, not only because it‚Äôs a great car but more importantly, I hope and believe it can inspire other companies to actively incorporate sustainability goals into all aspects of their business. Fisker then had the idea of calling me ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù adviser. Which I am not. Just to be clear. Thanks Henrik, sounds cool, but I am an actor and a citizen, and that‚Äôs really it.

And what about Hollywood? Is our industry changing, are we at the forefront? Looking at social media, you would think so. And things are happening, but usually only when a camera is pointed at people. Remember a few years back when all awards shows only used EVs for the red carpet? We made a difference. We mattered. We showed the way. So cool. So green, so ‚Ä¶ brief. Now it‚Äôs back to the Escalade. But hey, we are not using plastic straws anymore!

To believe that change will come from Hollywood is not really based in reality (when did that stop us?), but we are great at reacting ‚Äî and things around us are changing, and changing us. I have a good friend who loves his SUV. It‚Äôs not electric. But he cannot give up his car. He is a good guy, he‚Äôs works for the U.N., so if he has a problem going electric, we all do. But if he is presented with an alternative that doesn‚Äôt mean a reduction in his quality of life, something like the Fisker SUV, I think he‚Äôd transition to electric in a heartbeat.

The IPO deal values Fisker Inc at US$2.9 billion, with an IPO share price of $10.

On July 30, 2020, Fisker announced plans for a four-vehicle portfolio by 2025. The Fisker Ocean SUV will be joined by a sports sedan based on their previously announced Fisker Emotion concept, a coupe-like SUV, and a lifestyle pickup truck. All will be electric vehicles.

On October 15, 2020, Fisker Inc announced it would be outsourcing vehicle production of its Fisker Ocean electric SUV to Magna Steyr, to reduce the complexities and costs related to the building and operating its own factory. Magna will start building the Fisker Ocean in Europe in 2022.

## Henrik Fisker Interview quotes:

I have people on Twitter saying, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just make the car next month? You have a prototype.‚Äù Most people don‚Äôt understand that it takes 18 months to do long-lead body tooling for high-volume vehicles. Most people don‚Äôt understand it takes two years to do durability tests and do all the engineering certification and everything else.

And on the business model itself, I believe that there is nobody in the near future or the next couple of years that‚Äôs going to make a million EVs on one model. Today, there‚Äôs nobody doing it. Tesla probably has the highest volume of one single model, a couple hundred thousand. But even the big giant established carmakers are not making, right now, a couple hundred thousand vehicles of one model. So the way you get volume, in my view, is if you partner up with other OEMs and share some of the expensive parts of the platform, which in my view is not anymore something that is unique IP or something that is a unique experience to the customer. An aluminum stamped floor or a steel stamped floor really doesn‚Äôt have any brand value anymore.

And obviously, as we move forward, we always start to do some of the things ourselves. But it was really about de-risking in our first vehicle to market. So we‚Äôre going to do another three vehicles, which we can do because we don‚Äôt have to spend all our money and effort on learning how to manufacture a car, for instance.

So we have programmed a lot. We have hired a head of ESG, environmental and social governance, and he is really spearheading developing specific... we kind of put out some goals that we would like to reach with suppliers, and we at least try to bring them in that direction. They are not reaching those goals right now, but they may reach them later. And then we have goals for ourselves. So for instance, we look at transport. Are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs closer to the plant, or are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs on the other side of the planet that way we have to then transport all that stuff. So those are the types of things that we‚Äôre really thinking about now as we‚Äôre nominating suppliers. And finally, materials as well, looking at sustainable materials. We‚Äôve actually picked up a lot of knowledge on that side as well, where we are adding more sustainable materials to our vehicle. So we are actually looking across everything ‚Äî supply chain, where the suppliers are located, what the suppliers are doing for sustainability, and also then of course in the vehicle itself ‚Äî in terms of the type of materials there.

So - let's summarize - prices are rising at their fastest pace in almost 30 years and incomes just plunged by their most ever! We're gonna need more stimmies!""  

Plus  to above; 

Last year, Hirschman Capital noted that since 1821, 98% of sovereigns that hit 130% debt/GDP have defaulted on their sovereign debt.   

The US hit 130% late last year. 

Simple Conclussion : The Fed can‚Äôt go ‚Äúhawkish‚Äù and raise rates without sending markets ‚Äìand economies‚Äìto their knees; by extension, they now have nothing left to ‚Äúcut‚Äù when the current everything bubble implodes.

And that  is a *real problem*.

 There are only two ways for sovereigns to default: 

Inflation or collapse.    

The latter is not an option. 

 As for a solution, what‚Äôs so tragic is that the only option before the Fed is an even bigger problem‚Äîcurrent and inevitably more inflation. 

 That is, if the Fed wants to keep markets (and their job security) breathing, they no longer have the foregoing template of ‚Äúrate-hike-followed-by-rate-cutting‚Äù at their disposal, which means they now have no choice but to dovishly keep rates near the zero-bound indefinitely.

But the only way to keep rates ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù and nailed to the floor of time is to purchase otherwise unwanted bonds to keep their prices elevated and hence yields and rates repressed.

Such bond ‚Äúaccommodation,‚Äù of course, costs money, and as we already know, the only ‚Äúmoney‚Äù the Fed has to spend is the kind they create out of thin air‚Äì the very kind of money (and policy) which leads to the kind of inflation discussed above‚Äînamely, the brutal kind.

 As for that fake money, the evidence of the Fed‚Äôs desperate (and only) direction is now obvious, as the following M2 money supply makes equally clear. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v774ta55sw171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e73c839beb67a67eea9aed7de4ac61d86813840

 

Fed is so embarrassed by this ‚Äúprinting solution‚Äù that they‚Äôve stopped *weekly* reporting of M2 data, and frankly, since March, have even stopped *monthly* reporting of the same.

That, of course, is both telling as well as disgraceful‚Ä¶ The Fed literally has something to hide, and that never bodes well, does it?

&#x200B;

 The correlation to central bank balance sheet (i.e., money supply) expansion and rising markets is now beyond dispute. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sgizb6xcsw171.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=aad2fe681fe0c49ac20368aba77e86c118b22959

 In short‚Äîdo you see the correlation and pattern? Do you see how the Fed‚Äôs market sausage is made? More importantly, do you now see the Fed‚Äôs self-made conundrum? 

 

Given that the Fed bows to the markets not the people, which choice do you think they‚Äôll make?

In other words, expect more money printing and more yield curve control‚Äîand hence more money creation, more inflation, and by extension more fiat currency debasement.

 More money supply to keep rates monetized simply means more currency debasement and rising inflation.",nn51ou,"""Fed's ""Favorite"" #Inflation Indicator (PCE) Explodes At Fastest Rate Since 1992 As Incomes Crash By Record"""

I have leading indicators telling me that there are two concurrent shifts underway when it comes to who is purchasing homes.

\- Massive increase in unmarried people buying houses alone. This used to be somewhat unusual, now it's becoming very common.

\- Massive increase in unmarried men, in particular, buying houses alone. Traditionally, the female-to-male ratio of unmarried homebuyers was about 5 to 1. For the last 3 months, it's been closer to 50/50.

Source is my own closed real estate purchase transactions. Am a mortgage broker (btw this means cash purchases are ""invisible"" to me). It takes 3-6 months for [HMDA data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Mortgage_Disclosure_Act) to become accessible to journalists and academics, and thus ""visible"" to the general public (assuming journalists deem it worthy of commenting on), but I can see the trends live in real time.

How would one go about placing a bet that in about 3 or 6 months, the media, journalists, academics, etc, will pick up on this, publish articles, and potentially cause a lot of people to buy certain stocks. Which stocks would that be? Is there a ""Mancave, Inc"" out there that would potentially get an uptick? Or maybe a company making smart-home stuff that is particularly suited to renting by the room (the single men are not buying 1 bedroom condos, they are buying proper houses with 3 bedrooms, etc)?

EDIT: oh, and to be clear. It's not just an uptick in single men. It's an uptick in women too, but a massive surge from the men. It used to be that for 15 banana sales, 10 are to married couples, 4 to single women, and 1 to a single man. Now for the same 15 banana sales, it's 6 to married couples, 6 to single women, and 3 to single men, something like that.",nn76we,Homebuyer Demographics Shift towards single and male. How to bet?

8917,,2021-05-28 22:17:57,t3_nn96hb,,wallstreetbets," The AMC squeeze has actually been setup since February. Back in early February when you saw the squeezes of many companies, the two front runners being AMC and GME, they were the literal beginning of and were setting up the actual SHORT squeezes which are going to be never seen before numbers. guys if we go back in time to February just about after the squeezes, the hedge funds had just lost billions and billions after those gamma squeezes(I say gamma cause compared to what AMC is about to do it is nothing) and even after the squeezes they didn't even cover all of their positions(which you'll see why this is the cause of the current mega squeeze), they want to lose the least amount of money as possible so they aren't going to cover ALL of their shorts when the stock is still up around 5x to10x what they would've owed just days before, so they still kept shorting it after the squeeze and got it back down to around $5 per share, NOW, that $5 per share is still double or triple what they would've owed before the squeeze so this scares them, it would still put them in so much debt that they would probably much rather just not live with it so the only fucking thing they could have done was keep shorting the stock to get it down as least as possible to cover their shares as close as possible to the price they expected it to be at(which was very hard to guess but probably around $1-3 per share). The only thing that matters is that they didn't hit that mark and that absolutely fucked them, not going down to $1-3 per share back after the squeeze in February is the reason we are going to see AMC in the hundreds or even thousands by next week. The price not going to where they wanted, caused them to be left holding a bag that they needed and still need to pay eventually, the thing is there's no set date for when they need to cover so they can keep shorting it for as long as possible and try and get the stock down to where they want to cover the rest of the shorts they owed for the least amount of money possible, which i believe was that $1 to $3 mark. so they have been shorting AMC for months and have been doing so drastically since that February squeeze. the thing is they have been the slightest bit successful and that's why we haven't seen the squeeze sooner, AMC has been set to squeeze this whole time since February. if it ran through 15 the hedge funds would know it would take off and this squeeze would happen then and there, and they are trying to get this squeeze to not happen at all. instead you see $15 being tested plenty of times within these months and when it got close, the hedge funds had to short the stock drastically to not go rapidly through $15. we would have seen the squeeze sooner once it went rapidly through $15. However their success of keeping the stock below $15 had triggered them to believe it was still possible to get the stock down past $8 cause their new target price to cover their shorts was below 8 dollars. So the fact that AMC has held within that $8 to $15 range and didn't ever squeeze has caused the hedge funds to keep shorting it for absolutely no reason other than to get it down past $8, and since it hasn't happened for months, they had to short it for months, WELL GUESS WHAT. THEY RAN OUT OF FUCKING SHORT SHARES TO BORROW. THERE ARE 0 SHARES AVAILABLE TO BORROW. THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE. you will not even begin to understand what this causes. this means the hedge funds are having to cover all of the shorts they've been purchasing since February, which is essentially all of the short shares AMC has to offer and they cant borrow any so they HAVE to be payed for. the thing is the hedge funds haven't even begun to pay at all, like have payed 0% of what they owe and the stock has already tripled in just a couple days. the brokers have all the leverage and control over the hedge funds and the hedge funds owe the brokerage and HAVE to pay they cant borrow shorts like they used to anymore cause they bought so much there simply is none left to borrow and it is completely insane and unseen before. I know that no matter what, AMC is is currently worth to be set up at hundreds of dollars even thousands. I had bought in the middle of the last squeeze and have held a $15 per share position since February 2nd because I have know it has always been due to squeeze and there are thousands of people like me that have also known. the thing is that if it were to squeeze before it would be on a much smaller scale than what is about to happen because the hedge funds would have had short shares to borrow. now that there are none to borrow you guys actually don't know what this means for the stock. you can expect it to make one big pull up and a massive sell off before the actual squeeze. for those of you that understand this I know how excited you are but you also have to stay calm and remember how much manipulation there is and even if all the data and analysis is indicating huge gains it could possibly turn out to be huge losses. If i were you guys id take your own time and scale AMC up to the Volkswagen squeeze in 2008 and see how fucking similar they are. Stay safe",nn96hb,r/EAD THIS SHIT

I'm normally a total lurker but I had to report my latest experience retail investing with SoFi, especially considering they go public on Tuesday.

For the last several months, SoFi has given AMC a warning instead of the normal description that other volatile stocks have:

""INVESTOR ALERT: This stock has experienced unprecedented price movement and presents an elevated risk. Investors could experience signifigant financial loss investing in this stock. Please carefully consoder these risks before investing.""

Unlike RobinHood whom restricted trades, SoFi support is very specific that anyone can still trade the stock. Meanwhile, my argument is that by having a warning on only one stock that says 
it is dangerous (terms which you sign up for on account creation), it has influenced a normal investors due diligence.

I asked if SoFi or if any of their investors were shorting $AMC I was told that all of that will be made public on Tuesday. Please use this info for your own DD.",nna7vr,SoFi is discriminating against AMC

8928,,2021-05-28 23:18:52,t3_nnac8t,,wallstreetbets,"Several reasons why I am bullish on BYND: 

High short interest. According to Ortex, its percentage of float shorted has grown to 27%, on par with or higher than GME (21%), AMC (17%), and BB (9%). 

The squeeze just started. Other squeezes have been occurring for months and have pushed their share prices to many times their prior levels. The more a stock rises, the less future runway it has and the more room it has to fall.  The BYND squeeze just started this week. BYND is less than 65% of its all-time high and only 75% of its local high set in January. It has another 25% to go before it reaches its price set in January.    

Improving fundamentals. Overseas expansion and numerous partnerships: McDonald‚Äôs, KFC, Pizza Hut, Yum, Taco Bell. Its double upgrade this week was the first in its history as a public company. It now has two consecutive upgrades. This raises the possibility that institutional investors are coming into the stock as well as retail investors, as well as funds that might cover their shorts. Most of the other short targets have had more downgrades than upgrades recently. 

Additional motivation. It would be great to see BYND rise to a level that would allow it to get more capital for R&D on more favorable terms. BYND is great for the environment and animals and people have motivation to see it succeed.",nnac8t,Reasons to be bullish on BYND

The above link is what I said 2 days ago. At the time EXPI was hovering around $28.50 and since then it has shot up to about $32.27 on what appears to be about average volume for the stock. 

I still think they are going to have a huge share buyback of over 14m shares (their buyback program was increased from 75m to 475m) in stock and add to the insider owned shares which is now at 54.80% over the week it has gone up about 2%. Which is a bullish signal. If 14m shares were bought that would leave about 51m shares to be traded publicly and the insider owned share percentage would go to about 62% which would be a large driving factor in the price going up due to scarcity. Also the buyback would be large enough to trigger a massive buy and I would jizz my pants.",nmnbfw,*UPDATE* Why I still Think EXPI Is Going To $60 In 4-6 Weeks (up 10.59% this week)

[When we last left our hero,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrly28/the_legend_of_utheemperorofjenks_aka_ornamental/) he had just lost all of his rent money and what he could advance from credit cards on a failed Super Bowl bet, and a YOLO on ‚ÄúRhodium‚Äù that he ordered from a sketchy Slovakian Wish.com ripoff. Alas, it was, of course, fake, and he was broke and depressed. It might have been the first fatal case of autism. He thought to himself ‚ÄúAm I really that retarded?‚Äù Then, he realized ‚ÄúNo, it must be Oklahoma that‚Äôs retarded!‚Äù

So, [after a brief case of violent diarrhea from Oklahoma Grocery Store sushi](https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/lrslbb/psa_do_not_eat_grocery_store_sushi_right_now/), he was ready to hatch his plan! Uruguay! Yes, Uruguay. [He was going to move to Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lh5igx/c%C3%B3mo_se_puede_llegar_a_melo_desde_montevideo_sin/)

His plans for this move could‚Äôve been anyone‚Äôs guess. One possibility he inquired about was [how to be a Tea Blendmaster.](https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/lfga0m/how_does_one_become_a_blendmaster/) [Another was him possibly reconnecting with God.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/lsij6j/agnostic_jew_seeking_faith_in_god/) Yet, he seemed to be asking questions about another topic more often than the others...

[Bees.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lxcnt1/c%C3%B3mo_es_la_legalidad_de_la_apicultura_informal/)

Specifically, beekeeping, a topic he admitted he had no experience in, [as evident from him looking for any book on the subject as an introduction months before.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/)

What he planned on doing with the bees was anyone‚Äôs guess, and I doubt he thought it through that much either. One post **AFTER** he took possession of 200,000 bees (we‚Äôll get to that later,) was [asking Americans if there was a demand for mead in the states.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/) So, was he thinking of importing Uruguayan honey to the US to be made into mead? Was he going to make it himself? Did he move to another continent for no reason? Let‚Äôs all find out!

A little more than 2 months ago, he finally did it. [He moved to Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/m9ejpn/la_paloma/) And about a week after that, [he was driving a truck filled with 200k bees across his new country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/) Based on replies in that thread, he was aiming to have [a monopoly on beekeeping in the country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/gt48gke/) 

And for a while, things were kind ok for our young Autist. [He picked up his hives without complication.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mtkkf3/about_to_upsize_my_apiary_whats_the_best_layout/) [And then he settled into Melo, Uruguay, and set up his apiary ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/n1jnte/my_humble_apiary_near_melo_uruguay/). Life was good.

But, trouble was afoot. According to a reply, [the species he was planning on keeping had literally never been kept by keepers in Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mtkkf3/about_to_upsize_my_apiary_whats_the_best_layout/gv0viej/) And then, disaster struck. [He went to TIFU to post his tale of spreading an invasive species in an industry he knew nothing about.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/nmd69k/tifu_by_importing_bees_to_uruguay/)

Indeed, he had no idea even what a bee was until he stumbled his way through a book, and then decided to YOLO into honey in Uruguay. He somehow got in touch with an ecology professor in Montevideo that would help him set things up in exchange for grad students fucking with them every now and again. Oh, and the bees were from fucking Myanmar. Handshake agreement, of course. Total Chad move.

And like I said before, the rest went without incident for a while. It would take the bees ‚Äúa year‚Äù to make honey, so he just kinda hung out, stayed busy, and tried to find part time work in a foreign country he arrived in 2.5 months earlier.

And then, the professor ghosted him. Just disappeared. Shortly thereafter, government agents come out about this kid from Oklahoma illegally importing a non-native bee to their country. Apparently his bees had been fucking with other apiaries. So, he did probably the smartest thing he‚Äôs ever done.

He ran.

He fucking ran from the Uruguayan government, took a plane to LAX, and arrived with $14 to his name. His friend sent him $100, which wasn‚Äôt enough to go back to Oklahoma, so he took a $75 flight to Seattle, where he is also not from.

9062,,2021-05-28 03:12:37,t3_nmofz4,,wallstreetbets,"This started as a comment reply but I thought maybe people would like reading it. I've been researching Palantir since literally late November 2020 and I have nearly my entire portfolio in LEAPS expiring January 2023. So I have continually done more research on them this is just the basics to clear up confusion and help people who don't understand it because it's hard to hear all the hype and stuff. Also AMC to the moon tomorrow for my FDs I bought!! Don't judge me it's just fun to be in on the action on weeks like this.


So you should think of palantir as basically three companies and they actually are very far from unprofitable. 

They developed the really massive government software (gotham) specifically as a result of an interaction that happened to Peter Thiel while he was at paypal. They were losing millions to foreign scammers at paypal and the solution ended up being a high quality algorithm that flagged the most likely scam transactions and then allowed analysts to efficiently double check and verify the real scam transactions.

 It essentially was using what computers are efficient at (sorting through massive amounts of data) and then combining that with what humans are good at (looking at the more complex nuances that at least at that point computer algorithms were incapable of doing) and augmenting the humans ability to make complex decisions by rapidly sorting through the incoming data and bringing everything good to their attention.

They fixed paypals using this method and literally made the company profitable overnight because of fixing how much they were losing in the scam transactions. The FBI contacted PayPal and Thiel about using that initial software. That was literally his inspiration for what would become Palantir. He goes over it in huge detail in his book zero to one. If you make an audible account you can read it for free and find the chapter I'm talking about.

Then for 15 years they perfected the government software into the absolute nearly monopoly it is now in government intelligence augmentation software. The whole time though they reinvested almost everything for the last 10 years into building the commercial software (Foundry). That side of the business has only been live for a VERY short time and initially they literally didn't spend a single dollar on marketing their first commercial clients sought THEM out because of their insane reputation with the government. Foundry helps with supply chains and all kinds of other important data  insights. But if you want a recent example the NIH and the NHS both used Foundry to figure out how to best distribute the vaccine and vaccine distribution in the US and Britain has far outpaced expectations. You think commercial companies aren't going to be interested in using the software that was literally proven on a level like that?

 They're only just now adding huge amounts of people to their sales teams literally in the last six months which if you read Peter thiels book is insane for the stock because they have this crazy long term plan and he literally talks about how when they get to a certain point and start adding sales as a full sector of the company it means that is the company the company plans to BEGIN scaling. Meaning they're this big and they literally only just started on the scaling part. Which they've also said in tons of interviews if you're a die hard Palantirian like me. 



They actually also have the third side of the  business which is their actual like full AI for weaponization and war and defense for the government. Gotham is like helping analysts and commanders lead and even helping police or agents figure out what's going on. This other software is different. It's called Apollo and its only at the beginning too. It's like pure AI machine learning AI handles everything stuff. Go find a video called pentagon head of NSC briefs public on AI I think it's on the PBS channel on YouTube or some shit. Or you can listen to Joe Biden talk about how we're going to double our percentage of gdp spending on AI. The amount of government money that's going to go into AI as a weapon to compete with China DWARFS peoples expectations of how much large the market for the kind of software palantir makes is. 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201001005334/en/U.S.-Army-Research-Lab-Selects-Palantir-Technologies-Inc.-for-91M-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-Development

This is literally the backbone of everything AI that the government is about to invest in. Sure they're going to experiment with other research but if you do research you'll also find Palantir is the ONLY company that does anything remotely like this software that has anywhere near the kind of clearances like what is required for these contracts. They are currently a clearance level 5 and about to be the highest 6. The closest competitors are almost all a 3 or lower I'm not even sure if there's more than a single 4 and that stuff is crazy hard to get. 

But like again I'm an obsessive. I realize why people get so excited about the commercial side scaling and how it's very possible and can make them huge and it will. But I'm actually pretty sure the reason people like Cathy Wood has such a huge boner for them is that she realizes how MASSIVELY. And I mean MASSIVELY underestimated the amount of government revenue they will get from all this AI investing the United States and NATO are about to do. It's literally the next Manhattan project and they're absolutely going to be one of the biggest players developing it if not the biggest. I think it's funny because most people are pretty disinterested in the government stuff for Palantir but i really think the weaponized AI apollo stuff may be as big as anything could ever be. 




Also people got the insider selling stuff very very wrong. Tom Nash (love him or hate him I don't care) has a few really good recent videos where he explains it in basically full detail what was happening. The selling panicked a lot of retail investors during a time when the buying for growth markets had really slowed because of rate hike due to inflation scares and a ton of retail holders got scared and caused more selling and more people got scared because of that and sold and it really just was mass psychology in effect and a LOT of FUD and confusion. 

Basically a few executives karp in particular got billions of dollars worth of options that vest but literally expire so you have to exercise them which means you buy shares of the company at a strike price. Well because it's the company granting shares the strike price is literally 10 cents or something and these automatically have to vest at quarterly increments. So everytime karp was exercising he's actually buying shares. Like over 150 million in total maybe a lot more million SHARES not dollars. shares. And even those when he exercising he's buying shares technically from the company it ALL counts as profit on taxes and ITS NOT LONG TERM CAP GAINS ELIGIBLE. So over the last year plus this year he's essentially getting shares but the literal dollar value of those shares to the government counts as pure profit. So his total income which he's getting taxed at 40% of is in the BILLIONS yes billions. Because that's a lot to handle people that work for them actually automatically schedule sells of shares to cover the taxes so that there's no issue it's not even like him saying sell today and they do this.... TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INSIDER SELLING TO THE SEC. That's why it's automatically happening so no one can ever claim he's timing it. 

So listen cause here's where it gets important. The exercising of the shares counts as almost pure profits but remember he's receiving SHARES not dollars he doesn't actually get billions of dollars. So has to then sell SOME of the shares so he can pays taxes on that. Then when he sells the shares to pay the taxes for exercising he actually owes even more money if they went up from when he exercised. So everytime he's selling low its actually good for him because it's less ADDITIONAL PROFIT that he would owe taxes on.

 If he wasn't selling its because he thought it would go down even further and then he would actually owe less taxes overall. So if he thought it was going to tank he'd wait and actually get a nice fat discount on his taxes. 

I know this seems really crazy but I promise that's how it works you can look it up in detail but yeah shocking that mainstream media and redditors/youtubers who barely do research and have no real understanding of how these billion dollar compensations work would get it wrong. Unbelievable I know. If he had actually sold the massive overall percentage of his shares that some people claim he did the company would be at like $3-6 dollars not low 20s. Retail got confused because of market pressured due to interest rate fears from inflation and sold low (like retail always does) to institutions.",nmofz4,"Palantir DD if you want to understand company and it's history better (also insider ""selling"" explained in detail)"

What is Blue Apron?


Blue Apron (NYSE: APRN) was the forgotten step child, bad luck Brian, IPO of summer 2017 that priced below range and had the misfortune of debuting after Amazon bought Whole Foods. Since it‚Äôs debut, the stock has suffered dropping from nearly $150 per share (adjusted for a 2019 reverse-split necessitated to stay listed) to as low as approximately $2.00!


Why the Drop?


Management. Fucking. Sucked. The prior executive team essentially handed Chad Hello Fresh the keys to the kingdom, when they made the fatal error of betting that the ‚Äúhigh affinity core users‚Äù would be enough to sustain the business. For this reason, they cut marketing to nearly nothing and attempted to realize operating leverage by shrinking the customer base only to its most prolific buyers.

This was stupid. HelloFresh did the opposite, essentially giving away meals, and they used it to stockpile market share. Put a chart up of HelloFresh customers against Blue Apron. You‚Äôll see the two lines converge and a clear indication that HelloFresh stole most of their business. HelloFresh was one of the best trades of the past 5 years. Look at the chart, look at the sales, and look at the margins. They have managed to achieve operating leverage by employing affordable pricing and emphasizing retention.


Blue Apron Might Go Under....


Today the company is in a dire place. Languishing away in Micro Cap hell at an $80M market cap, no one on Wall Street wants to cover these guys. Only their bankers, CG and MS, write them research and neither are overly optimistic. They‚Äôre in a shit spot with a credit line that mandates they keep $15M cash at all times, and they keep their customer base above 300K (thus far, they‚Äôve struggled). They‚Äôre sitting on $29M and burn enough cash per Q that they might go below that $15M level (wouldn‚Äôt be a first). All signs are negative...


But I Think They Might Win


Blue Apron is under new management. Linda Kozlowski, is the former COO of ETSY and an ex-strategist at Alibaba. She believes HelloFresh did things right and she wants to right the ship. Her ballsy-ass plan is to ride the line on cash and go all in on customer growth. She realizes those customers are worth a lot more than income on the P&L, and that she needs to make the pot as big as she can. Thus far, it‚Äôs worked. Customers are up over 20% in the past two periods and retention rates are rising. We are seeing signs of operating leverage, and it opens a big possibility.


My Prediction

Management is buying shares. They know the company is not healthy. The only logic is that they have a plan that‚Äôs working. You can‚Äôt sell a dying business with a shrinking share, but you can certainly sell a growing community, that could be an accretive asset to a better capitalized entity. I think Linda is going either get the business in a position where it can refinance for better terms, or where it can be sold to create shareholder value via a strategic alternative.

If that happen, given this is priced for bankruptcy and ignored by the Street, the returns could easily reach the triple digits. I‚Äôm long and I plan to add on additional weakness.

Disclosure- I‚Äôm buying a stock that might go under. This is not advice! I‚Äôm stupid.",nmoit0,Blue Apron: Hero or Zero

Everyone is talking about how the squeeze didn't even happen and the shorts didn't cover yet. What I don't understand is why wouldn't that be possible? If short interest is 17%, so let's round up to about 100M shares. Today the volume traded was 700M shares. Couldn't 100M of those 700M have been the shorts covering? And if they didn't cover, today alone 700M shares were traded, why would 100M shares bought by shorts cause a squeeze if today 700M were traded?

I have been having this question for awhile, since I noticed the same with GME. In the days preceding January 28th (when GME reached its peak), the combined volume was several times the amount of float. How come the squeeze happened and why did it happen? If the volume was so high, couldn't the shorts have covered in the days preceding that?

I hope this makes sense and I really hope someone will be kind enough to explain a fellow retard who only knows about crayons what this all means.

Everything looked to have gone off successfully. We are now waiting on the data and craft to be analysed and inspected. This will take a few weeks according to Michael Colglazier.

1st test flight - may 
2nd crewed flight - June 
3rd flight with R Branson on board late June/July 

4th flight this will be taking the Italian airforce on a training mission (600k a seat) late July


On the run in to the first test flight some possible maintenance issues appeared with the carrier plane White knight 2‚Ä¶. 
This indeed could have gone either way , after 2 weeks inspections it was decided that WK2 did not need to delay testing no maintenance was needed at this point. Scheduled Maintenance will commence in the fall after all tests have been completed.
Upon this news it is my opinion that the testing programme will go ahead as planned.

The market has responded accordingly and the stock is now up from $17-‚Ç¨31

However, like many of you, I've started to wonder where my next meal of tendies will come from... and I think they just might come from Outer Space.

I already made a few schekels scalping some OTM calls on SPCE earlier this week playing the successful flight and launch and then came across this little diddy. 

[https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/ufos-are-make-way-us-senate-know-rcna973](https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/ufos-are-make-way-us-senate-know-rcna973)

It seems as though the US government (Intelligence Agencies) are going to release very soon, everything that they know about... UFO's and Aliens. 

I've been thinking about playing it with Space stocks like MAXR, LMT, SPCE, BA and others. I've been watching MAXR since it shat the bed after earnings and it has been up every day since... I wonder if it is in preparation for the release?

In all seriousness, does anyone think this might be something to ""Explore?""

TLDR: Alien report will be released by US government shortly. Mass tendies from Outer Space? Space stocks may already be in rally mode in anticipation.

The above link is what I said 2 days ago. At the time EXPI was hovering around $28.50 and since then it has shot up to about $32.27 on what appears to be about average volume for the stock. 

I still think they are going to have a huge share buyback of over 14m shares (their buyback program was increased from 75m to 475m) in stock and add to the insider owned shares which is now at 54.80% over the week it has gone up about 2%. Which is a bullish signal. If 14m shares were bought that would leave about 51m shares to be traded publicly and the insider owned share percentage would go to about 62% which would be a large driving factor in the price going up due to scarcity. Also the buyback would be large enough to trigger a massive buy and I would jizz my pants.",nmnbfw,*UPDATE* Why I still Think EXPI Is Going To $60 In 4-6 Weeks (up 10.59% this week)

I just watched some Korean youtube channel talking about AMC stock that on June 2, $500 million of paid-in capital increase will be decided according to the vote result.

But, I heard somewhere that even if this happens, Adam(CEO) will not going to make it by 2021 which is a clear sign that he is on our side.

But I was not able to find the official remarks or sources that he claimed it.

[When we last left our hero,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrly28/the_legend_of_utheemperorofjenks_aka_ornamental/) he had just lost all of his rent money and what he could advance from credit cards on a failed Super Bowl bet, and a YOLO on ‚ÄúRhodium‚Äù that he ordered from a sketchy Slovakian Wish.com ripoff. Alas, it was, of course, fake, and he was broke and depressed. It might have been the first fatal case of autism. He thought to himself ‚ÄúAm I really that retarded?‚Äù Then, he realized ‚ÄúNo, it must be Oklahoma that‚Äôs retarded!‚Äù

So, [after a brief case of violent diarrhea from Oklahoma Grocery Store sushi](https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/lrslbb/psa_do_not_eat_grocery_store_sushi_right_now/), he was ready to hatch his plan! Uruguay! Yes, Uruguay. [He was going to move to Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lh5igx/c%C3%B3mo_se_puede_llegar_a_melo_desde_montevideo_sin/)

His plans for this move could‚Äôve been anyone‚Äôs guess. One possibility he inquired about was [how to be a Tea Blendmaster.](https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/lfga0m/how_does_one_become_a_blendmaster/) [Another was him possibly reconnecting with God.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/lsij6j/agnostic_jew_seeking_faith_in_god/) Yet, he seemed to be asking questions about another topic more often than the others...

[Bees.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lxcnt1/c%C3%B3mo_es_la_legalidad_de_la_apicultura_informal/)

Specifically, beekeeping, a topic he admitted he had no experience in, [as evident from him looking for any book on the subject as an introduction months before.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/)

What he planned on doing with the bees was anyone‚Äôs guess, and I doubt he thought it through that much either. One post **AFTER** he took possession of 200,000 bees (we‚Äôll get to that later,) was [asking Americans if there was a demand for mead in the states.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/) So, was he thinking of importing Uruguayan honey to the US to be made into mead? Was he going to make it himself? Did he move to another continent for no reason? Let‚Äôs all find out!

A little more than 2 months ago, he finally did it. [He moved to Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/m9ejpn/la_paloma/) And about a week after that, [he was driving a truck filled with 200k bees across his new country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/) Based on replies in that thread, he was aiming to have [a monopoly on beekeeping in the country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/gt48gke/)

Life was good.

But, trouble was afoot.

[He went to TIFU to post his tale of spreading an invasive species in an industry he knew nothing about.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/nmd69k/tifu_by_importing_bees_to_uruguay/)

Indeed, he had no idea even what a bee was until he stumbled his way through a book, and then decided to YOLO into honey in Uruguay. He somehow got in touch with an ecology professor in Montevideo that would help him set things up in exchange for grad students fucking with them every now and again. Oh, and the bees were from fucking Myanmar. Handshake agreement, of course. Total Chad move.

And like I said before, the rest went without incident for a while. It would take the bees ‚Äúa year‚Äù to make honey, so he just kinda hung out, stayed busy, and tried to find part time work in a foreign country he arrived in 2.5 months earlier.

And then, the professor ghosted him. Just disappeared. Shortly thereafter, government agents come out about this kid from Oklahoma illegally importing a non-native bee to their country. Apparently his bees had been fucking with other apiaries. So, he did probably the smartest thing he‚Äôs ever done.

He ran.

He fucking ran from the Uruguayan government, took a plane to LAX, and arrived with $14 to his name. His friend sent him $100, which wasn‚Äôt enough to go back to Oklahoma, so he took a $75 flight to Seattle, where he is also not from.

His last post is from a train out of the airport, with $39 to his name. I don‚Äôt know what is in store for him, but I know that $39 is as good as spent on urchin futures or whatever market he‚Äôs going to crash up there.

9861,,2021-05-28 03:12:37,t3_nmofz4,,wallstreetbets,"This started as a comment reply but I thought maybe people would like reading it. I've been researching Palantir since literally late November 2020 and I have nearly my entire portfolio in LEAPS expiring January 2023. So I have continually done more research on them this is just the basics to clear up confusion and help people who don't understand it because it's hard to hear all the hype and stuff. Also AMC to the moon tomorrow for my FDs I bought!! Don't judge me it's just fun to be in on the action on weeks like this.


So you should think of palantir as basically three companies and they actually are very far from unprofitable. 

They developed the really massive government software (gotham) specifically as a result of an interaction that happened to Peter Thiel while he was at paypal. They were losing millions to foreign scammers at paypal and the solution ended up being a high quality algorithm that flagged the most likely scam transactions and then allowed analysts to efficiently double check and verify the real scam transactions.

 It essentially was using what computers are efficient at (sorting through massive amounts of data) and then combining that with what humans are good at (looking at the more complex nuances that at least at that point computer algorithms were incapable of doing) and augmenting the humans ability to make complex decisions by rapidly sorting through the incoming data and bringing everything good to their attention.

They fixed paypals using this method and literally made the company profitable overnight because of fixing how much they were losing in the scam transactions. The FBI contacted PayPal and Thiel about using that initial software. That was literally his inspiration for what would become Palantir. He goes over it in huge detail in his book zero to one. If you make an audible account you can read it for free and find the chapter I'm talking about.

Then for 15 years they perfected the government software into the absolute nearly monopoly it is now in government intelligence augmentation software. The whole time though they reinvested almost everything for the last 10 years into building the commercial software (Foundry). That side of the business has only been live for a VERY short time and initially they literally didn't spend a single dollar on marketing their first commercial clients sought THEM out because of their insane reputation with the government. Foundry helps with supply chains and all kinds of other important data  insights. But if you want a recent example the NIH and the NHS both used Foundry to figure out how to best distribute the vaccine and vaccine distribution in the US and Britain has far outpaced expectations. You think commercial companies aren't going to be interested in using the software that was literally proven on a level like that?

 They're only just now adding huge amounts of people to their sales teams literally in the last six months which if you read Peter thiels book is insane for the stock because they have this crazy long term plan and he literally talks about how when they get to a certain point and start adding sales as a full sector of the company it means that is the company the company plans to BEGIN scaling. Meaning they're this big and they literally only just started on the scaling part. Which they've also said in tons of interviews if you're a die hard Palantirian like me. 



They actually also have the third side of the  business which is their actual like full AI for weaponization and war and defense for the government. Gotham is like helping analysts and commanders lead and even helping police or agents figure out what's going on. This other software is different. It's called Apollo and its only at the beginning too. It's like pure AI machine learning AI handles everything stuff. Go find a video called pentagon head of NSC briefs public on AI I think it's on the PBS channel on YouTube or some shit. Or you can listen to Joe Biden talk about how we're going to double our percentage of gdp spending on AI. The amount of government money that's going to go into AI as a weapon to compete with China DWARFS peoples expectations of how much large the market for the kind of software palantir makes is. 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201001005334/en/U.S.-Army-Research-Lab-Selects-Palantir-Technologies-Inc.-for-91M-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-Development

This is literally the backbone of everything AI that the government is about to invest in. Sure they're going to experiment with other research but if you do research you'll also find Palantir is the ONLY company that does anything remotely like this software that has anywhere near the kind of clearances like what is required for these contracts. They are currently a clearance level 5 and about to be the highest 6. The closest competitors are almost all a 3 or lower I'm not even sure if there's more than a single 4 and that stuff is crazy hard to get. 

But like again I'm an obsessive. I realize why people get so excited about the commercial side scaling and how it's very possible and can make them huge and it will. But I'm actually pretty sure the reason people like Cathy Wood has such a huge boner for them is that she realizes how MASSIVELY. And I mean MASSIVELY underestimated the amount of government revenue they will get from all this AI investing the United States and NATO are about to do. It's literally the next Manhattan project and they're absolutely going to be one of the biggest players developing it if not the biggest. I think it's funny because most people are pretty disinterested in the government stuff for Palantir but i really think the weaponized AI apollo stuff may be as big as anything could ever be. 




Also people got the insider selling stuff very very wrong. Tom Nash (love him or hate him I don't care) has a few really good recent videos where he explains it in basically full detail what was happening. The selling panicked a lot of retail investors during a time when the buying for growth markets had really slowed because of rate hike due to inflation scares and a ton of retail holders got scared and caused more selling and more people got scared because of that and sold and it really just was mass psychology in effect and a LOT of FUD and confusion. 

Basically a few executives karp in particular got billions of dollars worth of options that vest but literally expire so you have to exercise them which means you buy shares of the company at a strike price. Well because it's the company granting shares the strike price is literally 10 cents or something and these automatically have to vest at quarterly increments. So everytime karp was exercising he's actually buying shares. Like over 150 million in total maybe a lot more million SHARES not dollars. shares. And even those when he exercising he's buying shares technically from the company it ALL counts as profit on taxes and ITS NOT LONG TERM CAP GAINS ELIGIBLE. So over the last year plus this year he's essentially getting shares but the literal dollar value of those shares to the government counts as pure profit. So his total income which he's getting taxed at 40% of is in the BILLIONS yes billions. Because that's a lot to handle people that work for them actually automatically schedule sells of shares to cover the taxes so that there's no issue it's not even like him saying sell today and they do this.... TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INSIDER SELLING TO THE SEC. That's why it's automatically happening so no one can ever claim he's timing it. 

So listen cause here's where it gets important. The exercising of the shares counts as almost pure profits but remember he's receiving SHARES not dollars he doesn't actually get billions of dollars. So has to then sell SOME of the shares so he can pays taxes on that. Then when he sells the shares to pay the taxes for exercising he actually owes even more money if they went up from when he exercised. So everytime he's selling low its actually good for him because it's less ADDITIONAL PROFIT that he would owe taxes on.

 If he wasn't selling its because he thought it would go down even further and then he would actually owe less taxes overall. So if he thought it was going to tank he'd wait and actually get a nice fat discount on his taxes. 

I know this seems really crazy but I promise that's how it works you can look it up in detail but yeah shocking that mainstream media and redditors/youtubers who barely do research and have no real understanding of how these billion dollar compensations work would get it wrong. Unbelievable I know. If he had actually sold the massive overall percentage of his shares that some people claim he did the company would be at like $3-6 dollars not low 20s. Retail got confused because of market pressured due to interest rate fears from inflation and sold low (like retail always does) to institutions.",nmofz4,"Palantir DD if you want to understand company and it's history better (also insider ""selling"" explained in detail)"

What is Blue Apron?


Blue Apron (NYSE: APRN) was the forgotten step child, bad luck Brian, IPO of summer 2017 that priced below range and had the misfortune of debuting after Amazon bought Whole Foods. Since it‚Äôs debut, the stock has suffered dropping from nearly $150 per share (adjusted for a 2019 reverse-split necessitated to stay listed) to as low as approximately $2.00!


Why the Drop?


Management. Fucking. Sucked. The prior executive team essentially handed Chad Hello Fresh the keys to the kingdom, when they made the fatal error of betting that the ‚Äúhigh affinity core users‚Äù would be enough to sustain the business. For this reason, they cut marketing to nearly nothing and attempted to realize operating leverage by shrinking the customer base only to its most prolific buyers.

This was stupid. HelloFresh did the opposite, essentially giving away meals, and they used it to stockpile market share. Put a chart up of HelloFresh customers against Blue Apron. You‚Äôll see the two lines converge and a clear indication that HelloFresh stole most of their business. HelloFresh was one of the best trades of the past 5 years. Look at the chart, look at the sales, and look at the margins. They have managed to achieve operating leverage by employing affordable pricing and emphasizing retention.


Blue Apron Might Go Under....


Today the company is in a dire place. Languishing away in Micro Cap hell at an $80M market cap, no one on Wall Street wants to cover these guys. Only their bankers, CG and MS, write them research and neither are overly optimistic. They‚Äôre in a shit spot with a credit line that mandates they keep $15M cash at all times, and they keep their customer base above 300K (thus far, they‚Äôve struggled). They‚Äôre sitting on $29M and burn enough cash per Q that they might go below that $15M level (wouldn‚Äôt be a first). All signs are negative...


But I Think They Might Win


Blue Apron is under new management. Linda Kozlowski, is the former COO of ETSY and an ex-strategist at Alibaba. She believes HelloFresh did things right and she wants to right the ship. Her ballsy-ass plan is to ride the line on cash and go all in on customer growth. She realizes those customers are worth a lot more than income on the P&L, and that she needs to make the pot as big as she can. Thus far, it‚Äôs worked. Customers are up over 20% in the past two periods and retention rates are rising. We are seeing signs of operating leverage, and it opens a big possibility.


My Prediction

Management is buying shares. They know the company is not healthy. The only logic is that they have a plan that‚Äôs working. You can‚Äôt sell a dying business with a shrinking share, but you can certainly sell a growing community, that could be an accretive asset to a better capitalized entity. I think Linda is going either get the business in a position where it can refinance for better terms, or where it can be sold to create shareholder value via a strategic alternative.

If that happen, given this is priced for bankruptcy and ignored by the Street, the returns could easily reach the triple digits. I‚Äôm long and I plan to add on additional weakness.

Everyone is talking about how the squeeze didn't even happen and the shorts didn't cover yet. What I don't understand is why wouldn't that be possible? If short interest is 17%, so let's round up to about 100M shares. Today the volume traded was 700M shares. Couldn't 100M of those 700M have been the shorts covering? And if they didn't cover, today alone 700M shares were traded, why would 100M shares bought by shorts cause a squeeze if today 700M were traded?

I have been having this question for awhile, since I noticed the same with GME. In the days preceding January 28th (when GME reached its peak), the combined volume was several times the amount of float. How come the squeeze happened and why did it happen? If the volume was so high, couldn't the shorts have covered in the days preceding that?

The plan includes creating an online ticketing platform by Great British Railways which might have a huge blow on Trainline revenue. However, this platform does not yet exist and will probably take a couple of years to develop. Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed.

In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales.  Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%.

I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time  for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

9889,,2021-05-28 10:41:01,t3_nmuzzi,,wallstreetbets,"Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent of Modernas if not more. Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects) 

Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

Imagine if the spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize one piece to understand the whole picture it and helps modify your DNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates it can still recognize the virus. In contrast to using one portion of the picture as it mutates it's easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine, that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. Not only that but they have had the least amount of side effects of any covid vaccine deeming it the safest covid vaccine.... 

And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein (whole picture) and the safety profile. Also worth a mention is that you could store it in a regular refrigerator, and let it sit out in room temperature while you're vaccinating people instead of a special ultra low temp freeze needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers, this is a majority of the world. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines so other protein competitors will be far behind and they will have an a moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing they teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine. They will be combining flu and covid vaccine by 2025 for possibly double the price of current covid vaccine.

 They are pretty much de-risked at this point. Yes you could buy other  biotechs that can go up 20x but are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up) that has all successful trials done so far, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment to where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place there are no more glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""

They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. Yesterday at market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. 
 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

Future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract in there ( in the link below in another message). It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 

As far as my position I own some $200 July calls along with about 933 shares. I'm all in baby.  Been in since $4.06, I panicked and sold once during February a couple months during the mini bear market we had and got back in a bit too early so got a wash sale üôà but I'm diamond hands all the way to $800 from here.  LFG I expect to turn that into a cool million in a year's time via shares and options based on the DD provided. Just know this isn't all completely my DD some of this is taken from my good friends at the community Nvax community on Stocktwits. They're one of the most hardcore groups that provides excellent DD and are always willing to help each other a hand if anyone's got questions highly recommend to check it out. So my point is this is information collected over the months that is a group consensus on nvax future price. (Check out next link below this paragraph, it has My positions and an amazing DD chart converting contracts to future price and comparing with competitors. My screen name on stovktwits  is the same on there Johnnyknowsbest. Been on there and here since i started with nvax.

Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. This is huge as the combo is going to differentiate them especially since both flu and covid vaccines are first in class.

# SPY SG:

Looks like low volatility day. Play tight.

Note from SG: ""For todays expiration our models show about 15% SPX /30% SPY gamma expiring, which could allow volatility increase a bit into next week. This in turn may free markets for a push up into that 4250 target (Call Wall) area.""

Gamma Index: decreased to -0.1 (A large negative figure indicates volatility may be high. The range is from 4 to ‚Äì4.)

Vol Trigger: Increased to 419 (Important support and resistance level. (above this level = lower volatility and a more stable stock price.)

Abs Gamma Strike: Unchanged

Gamma Notional: Decreased to $-516 (stock has larger put gamma position. A negative gamma position implies higher volatility in the underlying)

Put Wall Support: Increased to 419 (If Put Wall shifts to a higher strike it could be a bearish indication)

Call Wall Strike: Increased to 425 (When this strike is rolled higher it is generally considered bullish)

Gamma Tilt: Decreased to 0.88	 (when decreasing it‚Äôs a bearish signal.)

Net Delta: Increased to 198k (positive delta position infers options market makers have a net long hedge.)

25d risk reversal: Increased to -0.06 (When the ratio shifts towards 0 it indicates call demand)

1) We look to the PTON CFO's statement found in the latest earnings call transcript, for guidance:
""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior.""
2) Being that we do not have access to a 10-K filing for Q4 fiscal '19, we will access other filings that do in fact reference numbers from fiscal '19...
A) 10-K filing dated 9/11/2020
B) 10-Q filing dated 5/6/2020
3) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $223.3M under Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19)
But, that is TOTAL Revenue; we need to find out what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike sales...
4) To calculate what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike Sales, we can use numbers from neighboring Q3 (i.e. Three Months Ended March 31, 2019)...
A) On page 6 of the 10-Q, you will find Revenue of ""Connected Fitness Products"" (aka Bike Sales) to be $261.6M
B) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $316.7M
C) % of Bike Sales per TOTAL Revenue: $261.6M / $316.7M * 100 = 82.6% {""Connected Fitness Products"" Revenue (aka Bike Sales)}
5) Apply 82.6% to the TOTAL Revenue $223.3M for Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19): $223.3M x 0.826 = $184.45M {Bike Sales for Q4 of fiscal '19}
6) Per the CFO, ""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior."":

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote... By mid-July, we‚Äôll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase precious metals  especially silver amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative 

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

Gold rose over 60% in the 1930s as the prices of stocks and real estate crashed. You could buy an entire block with a one ounce gold coin. Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms.

I must address Cramer's statement because he is obviously trying to add fuel to the short-selling fire: When he says ""we're not going natural gas"" he is clearly making a vague and general statement meant to be interpreted in the worst possible way: ""no one is going to buy or use natural gas."" By now, I hope everyone that is interested in this stock understands that CLNE offers an alternative transportation fuel, thus, the investments made by BP and Chevron, and not revolutionary technology like some EV's (but this is mostly hype meant to catapult EVs to the front. What most people do not realize is that driverless technology and such can be placed in Petro vehicles too). Also, unfortunately, the company has done a terrible marketting job. That's why powerful analysts can get away with making vague and unsupported statements. The fact that Cramer explained the stock's decrease over the last month as being due to widespread dissaproval is misleading, at best. Many people do not yet know about the cleanliness and therapeutic effects RNG has on the climate.

The News...

If you haven't read yet it looks like Federal Cannabis legalization my be around the corner. [Here](https://www.mpp.org/policy/federal/the-more-act/) is the House Bill. Supporters seem on board and like the reforms they have done to the bill including rescheduling cannabis. [Last time](https://mjbizdaily.com/key-us-house-lawmaker-reintroduces-federal-marijuana-legalization-bill/) the bill was introduced it cleared the House.   


Personally I think this gets a lot of support especially from a fiscal point of view. With stimulus stalling and a giant debate going on about how to pay for the stimulus I think cannabis offers the easiest way to collect federal revenue. A simple review of the bill and the fiscal benefits to the Fed's can be read [here](https://www.justtherealnews.com/congress/nadler-blumenauer-lee-jackson-lee-jeffries-velazquez-reintroduce-comprehensive-marijuana-reform-legislation/). The bill states a 5% fed tax. Money coming for uncle Sam, right when questions about paying for stimulus.... Personally I think it adds up, but that's for you to decide. 

Okay so that's the hype...

Let's talk about the tickers listed ($SNDL and $TLRY). 

$SNDL

I'll start with the cheaper YOLO, $SNDL. $SNDL short interest isn't high, but the company did issue convertible notes a while back around .7c if my memory is correct. I'm not saying they won't do it again, but they should be in a good place fiscally for now. Float is high with about 1.6B shares out there. However today's volume at the time of writing is over 415M. That's not bad given such a high float. It's about 200% more than the average volume. 

The options chain on $SNDL has me giddy. With over 200,000 options currently in the money on todays move above $1 there is some high potential here for some interesting action. The put to call ratio is just obnoxiously low at .08 it's screaming upwards betting. If we hold above $1 the potential squeeze up could be amazing.   


It's also broken up on the trend lines and out of the downward channel it was in. The regression channel from the peak squeeze back in Feb just broke out today according to my crayons I have laying around. 

$TLRY

$TLRY was the squeeze of a lifetime if you remember it back in 19'. The ticker was just a money printer with it's low float and stupid hype. Then they proceeded to do, like they all do, and issue debt. Shares tumbled since then falling from $120 --> $5. Ouch bag holders.   


Like all the cannabis stocks the Feb bump pushed $TLRY to above $60 in an amazing move. $TLRY has a lower short interest than $SNDL, but it also has a much lower float at about 300M. Compared to $SNDL the volume here isn't as good, but still remains decently above the avg volume around 36M as of right now. 

If we peep the options chain we also see a crazy low P/C ratio around .11. But we don't have the Open Interest in the chain like $SNDL does unless you roll out to Jun 18. Then we finally get some decent OI.   


Personally I am going with $SNDL. The option's chain looks better, the stock is cheaper, and the short interest is a little better. My advice would be to roll out till at least the Jun 11th $1 strike to not get eaten alive by Theta and IV crush. But WSB does what WSB wants and that's why I love you all.   
Do not go above the $2 strikes IMO. You will get crushed by theta unless we get an insane move, which could happen but I don't see the risk / reward there.",nn326f,MORE ACT / CANNABIS / $SNDL & $TLRY Potential

>A corner in the silver market has been tried before - and let's be clear, that is what is being attempted now.  In 1980, a rule change by the government destroyed the corner.  #silverthursday.

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday

>Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers‚Äô attempt to corner the market on the metal.

-
>Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926‚Äì2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers‚Äô Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.

-
>By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged‚ÄîMarch 27‚Äîsilver fell to $10.80, the metal‚Äôs biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, ‚ÄúA billion dollars isn‚Äôt what it used to be,‚Äù the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.

-
>To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978‚Äì91) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities.",nn36fw,There is no silver short squeeze happening.

* Henrik Fisker is a God among men in the automotive industry - trust him to do right
* Geeta Gupta-Fisker is a solid Chief Financial Officer with experience in investment banking - she will ensure the shares are valued right
* Henrik has learned from all the mistakes he made with his previous attempt to create Fisker Automotive, and will certainly do everything in his power to avoid that mess again. He has designed systems into the intricacies of the company to avoid failure - meaning Fisker Inc is guaranteed to succeed
* Henrik Fisker on shorting $FSR - ‚ÄúYou will quickly understand that you stand to lose a lot of money if you show it against Fisker‚Äù
* Production of Fisker Ocean expected to start in November 2022
* 250,000+ units a year expected by 2025
* Partnerships with Foxconn and Magna Steyr, both giants in their respective industries, among others
* Large Fleet market in Europe gaining momentum, and 700+ Fisker reservations in this market alone
* 16,000+ reservations already. More than Tesla had 18 months pre-production
* Revenue streams include leasing automotives, servicing, selling emissions credits, selling insurance (like selling the pickaxe to miners, and selling the diamonds to the mine owners too, absolutely genius - Fisker are insuring cars which they own, because the customer is only leasing it)
* High short interest (20%+), high analyst price targets compared to current share price (100%+) and low valuation compared to peers ($3bn market cap currently)
* Designing the first ever all-electric popemobile - Massive, soon to be historic, event!
* I give $FSR (currently $13 a share) a price target of $100 by end of year 2022, if not sooner
* Price Targets: $35 by end of year - Previous ATH. $50 start of next year - European and Chinese debut of prototypes. $100 end of 2022 - start of production (SOP). $150+ 2023
* 2025 Price Targets, calculated using projected data: Bear case - $97 a share, Bull case - $519 a share
* Downside in the short term is capped by the large amount of cash on hand - one third of market cap is cash. Long term, is capped by risk factors, which are almost eligible and affect every automotive startup anyway.

## Fisker Automotive

In 2008, Fisker Automotive raised over $90 million from investors including venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. In September 2009, Fisker Automotive was awarded a $528 million loan guarantee by the United States Department of Energy (DOE). The automaker was one of four recipients of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, to encourage the domestic manufacture of electric cars. The funds were to be used to develop the Karma, as well as an affordable family-size plug-in hybrid car. The loan facility was frozen at $192 million in February 2012, after the DOE claimed that Fisker missed its milestones

In December 2011, just as the Fisker Karma was launched, its battery supplier, A123 Systems, recalled all batteries, followed by a second recall in 2012. A123 filed for bankruptcy in October 2012, leaving Fisker Automotive without a battery supplier. After selling approximately 2,000 units, production of the Fisker Karma was suspended in November 2012, in the absence of its battery supplier.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/59vfj5wa8w171.png?width=511&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1c03d1e1254fea00c195776122de2b26099dd35

Henrik Fisker resigned as chairman from Fisker Automotive in March 2013, because of disagreements with management about business strategy. Later that year, the company declared voluntary bankruptcy.Fisker raised and spent more than a billion dollars over its lifetime.The heart of Fisker‚Äôs business model was in that early deal with Quantum. The idea was to design a gorgeous car, and have suppliers like Quantum provide the technology because off-the-shelf parts from suppliers would help keep costs down.

But there were problems with this strategy: Sometimes, those parts had to be custom-made to fit the design vision, which resulted in higher prices for Fisker. Other times, parts were delivered late or, worse, faulty, but Fisker was locked in to those supplier relationships. Sources close to Fisker have also said that many of the parts were owned by the suppliers themselves, so Fisker didn‚Äôt own a lot of the internal technology.

The broker that raised funds for Fisker automotive, by selling their private shares, was Advanced Equities.It wasn‚Äôt until December 2011 and into 2012 that the more dubious efforts of Advanced Equities became clearer to Fisker‚Äôs hundreds of investors. The last few hundred million dollars of Advanced Equities‚Äô fund raising for Fisker, starting with the D-1 round, was what brokers call ‚Äúpay to play.‚Äù As Fisker was running into technical, delivery and political problems, its valuation was quickly declining. But the company still needed more money, so the brokers went back to its current investors and said: Unless you give this more, your current shares will be diluted and your preferred stock will be converted to common stock.

It was essentially a gun to their heads. This is why investor Wray sued Fisker in February 2012, alleging he was on the receiving end of this tactic. In his lawsuit, he says Advanced Equities sent him a letter dated Jan. 18, 2012, stating that he needed to decide if he wanted to invest in Fisker‚Äôs next round, and pay around $84,000 by Jan. 27, 2012 ‚Äî a little over a week from receiving the letter. He also says that Advanced Equities assured him that he would have anti-dilution protection. According to the audio clip from Advanced Equities‚Äô internal sales call in early 2010, Advanced Equity leaders say that the Fisker deal will ‚Äúsuffer no dilution,‚Äù and was ‚Äúa dream scenario.‚Äù

That dream would soon end. In September 2012 after Fisker closed on $1.2 billion in funding, the bulk of it organized by Advanced Equities, the SEC charged the broker with misleading investors when it raised money for another company back in 2009 and 2010 (Bloom Energy). Advanced settled, agreeing to pay $1 million, and its co-founders were personally fined. Two months later Advanced Equities closed up shop.

Later, A123 Systems itself went bankrupt, causing more problems for Fisker. Fisker claimed that A123 Systems owed it $140 million, but a bankruptcy settlement reduced that to a paltry $15 million.

Then there was the just plain terrible luck for the ironically named Karma: Super Storm Sandy wiped out 338 of its Karmas in storage in New Jersey. The cars first drowned, and then caught on fire ‚Äî salt water damage caused a short circuit that was spread to other cars by high winds, Fisker said at the time.

With all of this happening in public ‚Äî and in a presidential election year ‚Äî Fisker‚Äôs struggles became highly politicized. The company was mentioned numerous times in presidential debates and speeches leading up to the election. Republican nominee Romney called Fisker and other DOE-supported companies losers.

The company didn‚Äôt seem to invest substantially in technology innovation or tech IP, and seemed to spend a disproportionate amount on suppliers. For example, numerous sources have said that the company paid upfront for 15,000 of some of the parts for its planned 15,000 Karmas. It ended up only selling around 2,000 of the cars. It has also been said that Fisker paid some funds upfront to have BMW make engines for the 100,000 Nina cars it hoped to produce ‚Äî in the end, Fisker didn‚Äôt deliver a single Nina.

Costs to build each Karma also creeped up because the company missed its volume targets, and because engineering had to change designs around supplier constraints. The company ended up adding $20,000 to its initial sale price.

Expensive hires may also have sucked away chunks of Fisker‚Äôs funding: Sources say that Fisker filled the upper levels of the company with seasoned auto executives from Detroit. At the high point of Fisker, the company had around 300 employees, plus dozens of contract staff. Bringing in a certain amount of the old guard could help a car startup ramp up quickly, and also impress potential investors with ‚Äúindustry names.‚Äù But those people are also used to big auto-industry budgets that included extensive travel and salaries ‚Äî that‚Äôs the opposite life of a tech startup.

## Fisker Inc.

In July 2016, Henrik Fisker expressed interest in designing a fully connected electric car with autonomous driving features and an aesthetically pleasing look. He has pursued battery technology, and hinted at potentially reviving the Fisker name with a pure-electric vehicle using technology that nobody else has. Since then Fisker has talked about delays to the promised solid state battery technology, which he does not expect to be able to be produced in volume until at least 2025. Posing risk for competition from more scientifically experienced future solid state battery producers such as Quantumscape.

***Forbes:*** ‚ÄúNow he‚Äôs back‚Äìand three things are different. First and foremost, he has a vital new partner: his wife, cofounder and Fisker Inc. CFO Geeta Gupta-Fisker. Second, his Los Angeles-based company is public this time around, raising more than $1 billion in an October 2020 IPO. And finally, Fisker‚Äôs stock price, up 56% since its debut, has made both Henrik and Geeta billionaires, each worth about $1.1 billion as of Friday‚Äôs market close. The auto industry has seen father-son and sibling leadership teams, but Fisker Inc.‚Äôs CEO-CFO combo is the fast-changing sector‚Äôs first husband and wife power couple.‚Äù

Wealth isn‚Äôt the purpose of the new company, Henrik says. ‚ÄúI never got into cars because of money. (This shows he is willing to do what is in the best interest of the company because he is not motivated by money, unlike 99% of other CEO‚Äôs)

The couple sought a big stake in the new venture to ensure they can control its fate in a way Fisker couldn‚Äôt with his earlier company.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yzhded6pfw171.png?width=408&format=png&auto=webp&s=54b30259720cf853a8efeacf058f2f74315260b9

Henrik is an auto industry celebrity, but Geeta‚Äôs background is equally impressive. A native of India, she holds multiple degrees in science, including a Ph.D. in biotechnology from Cambridge University where she was also a Research Newton Fellow. From there, she started a career in international investment for Lloyds Banking Group, and then managed investments for a high-net-worth client for several years. (In particular, this is insanely important - Geeta **KNOWS MONEY**! She knows how best to keep a company afloat, organize its share structure, provide value to shareholders, etc. because she has worked in the industry before. She may just be the most important element of Fisker Inc., due to the financial experience she has. At every step of the way, she is likely to make decisions with one sole focus - increasing share price and value).

She met her future husband in 2011 when he was visiting London, just before things started going very wrong at Fisker Automotive. They married in 2012.

‚ÄúWhen I left Fisker Automotive, all I had was my car,‚Äù Henrik remembers. ‚ÄúI'm in a different position, mainly because of Geeta. Because she cuts the deals.‚Äù

To get the new venture off the ground, the Fiskers invested the majority of their life savings‚Äìan enormous financial risk given the fate of Henrik‚Äôs prior company. Then, just as they were locking in plans for the IPO back in July, they were hit by a highly unwelcome complication: Geeta learned she had early-stage breast cancer.

‚ÄúShe got the call (from her doctor) during a call with investors,‚Äù Henrik says. Despite that bombshell, she continued working with banks and investors in the weeks that followed, even as she underwent two surgical procedures and radiation therapy. Her medical therapy concluded in November.

Henrik, who marvels at her fortitude throughout the health crisis says, ‚Äúshe only missed something like one day of work...That's just how she is. She works tirelessly.‚Äù

## Fisker Ocean

The Fisker Ocean will have a nearly 300-mile range with an 80 kWh battery and a solar panel roof as a range extender, adding approximately 1,000 free miles of range per year. Advanced electronics will be housed under the hood, and the vehicle will incorporate recycled and sustainable materials throughout. Deliveries of the Ocean are scheduled to begin in 2022.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s87j6bdsfw171.png?width=438&format=png&auto=webp&s=e40add9ce53319d31db242cce73a303afb03cbab

Fisker has also announced a partnership with Electrify America to ensure Fisker Ocean vehicles will integrate seamlessly with Electrify America charging stations when the e-SUV hits the market. With features such as a solar roof and recycled inner materials, it will be, according to Fisker Inc., the ""world's most sustainable vehicle.""

In 2017, Fisker Inc. announced that it had filed patents on flexible solid-state battery designs. Fisker expected the batteries to be produced on a mass scale around 2020. A prototype of the battery debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018. In October 2018, Fisker announced new funding for battery development through Caterpillar Venture Capital. The solid-state batteries are intended to deliver longer vehicle range and faster charging times.

In 2018, Fisker was named to the board of directors of First Cobalt, a North American cobalt refinery that produces battery materials.

In September 2019, it was announced that Fisker Inc. was partnering with Game of Thrones actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who will serve as a partner and sustainability adviser to Fisker, to work on advanced, affordable, electric mobility models.

&#x200B;

[In addition to being a well-known actor, Coster-Waldau is also the United Nations Development Program Goodwill Ambassador for climate change and other social issues.](https://preview.redd.it/3hssff5vfw171.png?width=451&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebe55e2468c5b63d1bc0ac3c71547219dff5afaa)

Nikolaj wrote this piece about Fisker:

To quote a friend of mine who is a lot smarter than me, architect Bjarke Ingels: ‚ÄúThe idea that sustainability needs to sacrifice quality of life is a flawed one. It‚Äôs a design challenge, a challenge to build something that transforms the idea of sustainability into something that will increase the quality of life for all those around it.‚Äù

One person meeting that challenge is Henrik Fisker, who has designed some of the most iconic cars over the past decades for BMW and others, like the BMW Z8, Aston Martin DB9 and Aston Martin V8 Vantage. He‚Äôs a hero for gas-guzzling supercars. He is a fellow Dane, I am a fan, and we met, of all places, on Twitter.

When we met in person, he described his new project ‚Äî an all-electric luxury SUV ‚Äî and asked me if I would help spread the word on his car. The problem as I see it with most electric cars is that they only accomplish the basics. They get you from point A to B. They run electric so you don‚Äôt pollute while driving, but that‚Äôs it. They are basically unattractive combustion engine cars that have a battery thrown into them ‚Äî and for most of them, a battery with a limited range. What Fisker does is to try to make every part of the car in a sustainable and attractive way, like a full-length solar roof, recycled floor mats and vegan leather seats. It looks incredibly cool and inviting, with a great 250- to 300-mile range, and at a cost of just under $40,000, it‚Äôs a luxury car affordable to a mass market.

I said yes and even became an investor, not only because it‚Äôs a great car but more importantly, I hope and believe it can inspire other companies to actively incorporate sustainability goals into all aspects of their business. Fisker then had the idea of calling me ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù adviser. Which I am not. Just to be clear. Thanks Henrik, sounds cool, but I am an actor and a citizen, and that‚Äôs really it.

And what about Hollywood? Is our industry changing, are we at the forefront? Looking at social media, you would think so. And things are happening, but usually only when a camera is pointed at people. Remember a few years back when all awards shows only used EVs for the red carpet? We made a difference. We mattered. We showed the way. So cool. So green, so ‚Ä¶ brief. Now it‚Äôs back to the Escalade. But hey, we are not using plastic straws anymore!

To believe that change will come from Hollywood is not really based in reality (when did that stop us?), but we are great at reacting ‚Äî and things around us are changing, and changing us. I have a good friend who loves his SUV. It‚Äôs not electric. But he cannot give up his car. He is a good guy, he‚Äôs works for the U.N., so if he has a problem going electric, we all do. But if he is presented with an alternative that doesn‚Äôt mean a reduction in his quality of life, something like the Fisker SUV, I think he‚Äôd transition to electric in a heartbeat.

The IPO deal values Fisker Inc at US$2.9 billion, with an IPO share price of $10.

On July 30, 2020, Fisker announced plans for a four-vehicle portfolio by 2025. The Fisker Ocean SUV will be joined by a sports sedan based on their previously announced Fisker Emotion concept, a coupe-like SUV, and a lifestyle pickup truck. All will be electric vehicles.

On October 15, 2020, Fisker Inc announced it would be outsourcing vehicle production of its Fisker Ocean electric SUV to Magna Steyr, to reduce the complexities and costs related to the building and operating its own factory. Magna will start building the Fisker Ocean in Europe in 2022.

## Henrik Fisker Interview quotes:

I have people on Twitter saying, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just make the car next month? You have a prototype.‚Äù Most people don‚Äôt understand that it takes 18 months to do long-lead body tooling for high-volume vehicles. Most people don‚Äôt understand it takes two years to do durability tests and do all the engineering certification and everything else.

And on the business model itself, I believe that there is nobody in the near future or the next couple of years that‚Äôs going to make a million EVs on one model. Today, there‚Äôs nobody doing it. Tesla probably has the highest volume of one single model, a couple hundred thousand. But even the big giant established carmakers are not making, right now, a couple hundred thousand vehicles of one model. So the way you get volume, in my view, is if you partner up with other OEMs and share some of the expensive parts of the platform, which in my view is not anymore something that is unique IP or something that is a unique experience to the customer. An aluminum stamped floor or a steel stamped floor really doesn‚Äôt have any brand value anymore.

And obviously, as we move forward, we always start to do some of the things ourselves. But it was really about de-risking in our first vehicle to market. So we‚Äôre going to do another three vehicles, which we can do because we don‚Äôt have to spend all our money and effort on learning how to manufacture a car, for instance.

So we have programmed a lot. We have hired a head of ESG, environmental and social governance, and he is really spearheading developing specific... we kind of put out some goals that we would like to reach with suppliers, and we at least try to bring them in that direction. They are not reaching those goals right now, but they may reach them later. And then we have goals for ourselves. So for instance, we look at transport. Are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs closer to the plant, or are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs on the other side of the planet that way we have to then transport all that stuff. So those are the types of things that we‚Äôre really thinking about now as we‚Äôre nominating suppliers. And finally, materials as well, looking at sustainable materials. We‚Äôve actually picked up a lot of knowledge on that side as well, where we are adding more sustainable materials to our vehicle. So we are actually looking across everything ‚Äî supply chain, where the suppliers are located, what the suppliers are doing for sustainability, and also then of course in the vehicle itself ‚Äî in terms of the type of materials there.

So - let's summarize - prices are rising at their fastest pace in almost 30 years and incomes just plunged by their most ever! We're gonna need more stimmies!""  

Plus  to above; 

Last year, Hirschman Capital noted that since 1821, 98% of sovereigns that hit 130% debt/GDP have defaulted on their sovereign debt.   

The US hit 130% late last year. 

Simple Conclussion : The Fed can‚Äôt go ‚Äúhawkish‚Äù and raise rates without sending markets ‚Äìand economies‚Äìto their knees; by extension, they now have nothing left to ‚Äúcut‚Äù when the current everything bubble implodes.

And that  is a *real problem*.

 There are only two ways for sovereigns to default: 

Inflation or collapse.    

The latter is not an option. 

 As for a solution, what‚Äôs so tragic is that the only option before the Fed is an even bigger problem‚Äîcurrent and inevitably more inflation. 

 That is, if the Fed wants to keep markets (and their job security) breathing, they no longer have the foregoing template of ‚Äúrate-hike-followed-by-rate-cutting‚Äù at their disposal, which means they now have no choice but to dovishly keep rates near the zero-bound indefinitely.

But the only way to keep rates ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù and nailed to the floor of time is to purchase otherwise unwanted bonds to keep their prices elevated and hence yields and rates repressed.

Such bond ‚Äúaccommodation,‚Äù of course, costs money, and as we already know, the only ‚Äúmoney‚Äù the Fed has to spend is the kind they create out of thin air‚Äì the very kind of money (and policy) which leads to the kind of inflation discussed above‚Äînamely, the brutal kind.

 As for that fake money, the evidence of the Fed‚Äôs desperate (and only) direction is now obvious, as the following M2 money supply makes equally clear. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v774ta55sw171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e73c839beb67a67eea9aed7de4ac61d86813840

 

Fed is so embarrassed by this ‚Äúprinting solution‚Äù that they‚Äôve stopped *weekly* reporting of M2 data, and frankly, since March, have even stopped *monthly* reporting of the same.

That, of course, is both telling as well as disgraceful‚Ä¶ The Fed literally has something to hide, and that never bodes well, does it?

&#x200B;

 The correlation to central bank balance sheet (i.e., money supply) expansion and rising markets is now beyond dispute. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sgizb6xcsw171.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=aad2fe681fe0c49ac20368aba77e86c118b22959

 In short‚Äîdo you see the correlation and pattern? Do you see how the Fed‚Äôs market sausage is made? More importantly, do you now see the Fed‚Äôs self-made conundrum? 

 

Given that the Fed bows to the markets not the people, which choice do you think they‚Äôll make?

In other words, expect more money printing and more yield curve control‚Äîand hence more money creation, more inflation, and by extension more fiat currency debasement.

 More money supply to keep rates monetized simply means more currency debasement and rising inflation.",nn51ou,"""Fed's ""Favorite"" #Inflation Indicator (PCE) Explodes At Fastest Rate Since 1992 As Incomes Crash By Record"""

I have leading indicators telling me that there are two concurrent shifts underway when it comes to who is purchasing homes.

\- Massive increase in unmarried people buying houses alone. This used to be somewhat unusual, now it's becoming very common.

\- Massive increase in unmarried men, in particular, buying houses alone. Traditionally, the female-to-male ratio of unmarried homebuyers was about 5 to 1. For the last 3 months, it's been closer to 50/50.

Source is my own closed real estate purchase transactions. Am a mortgage broker (btw this means cash purchases are ""invisible"" to me). It takes 3-6 months for [HMDA data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Mortgage_Disclosure_Act) to become accessible to journalists and academics, and thus ""visible"" to the general public (assuming journalists deem it worthy of commenting on), but I can see the trends live in real time.

How would one go about placing a bet that in about 3 or 6 months, the media, journalists, academics, etc, will pick up on this, publish articles, and potentially cause a lot of people to buy certain stocks. Which stocks would that be? Is there a ""Mancave, Inc"" out there that would potentially get an uptick? Or maybe a company making smart-home stuff that is particularly suited to renting by the room (the single men are not buying 1 bedroom condos, they are buying proper houses with 3 bedrooms, etc)?

EDIT: oh, and to be clear. It's not just an uptick in single men. It's an uptick in women too, but a massive surge from the men. It used to be that for 15 banana sales, 10 are to married couples, 4 to single women, and 1 to a single man. Now for the same 15 banana sales, it's 6 to married couples, 6 to single women, and 3 to single men, something like that.",nn76we,Homebuyer Demographics Shift towards single and male. How to bet?

I HAD EDITED THE POST EARLIER THAT WAS EXPLAINING THE SAME STUFF JUST VERY OUT OF ORDER AND HARD TO UNDERSTAND

If you guys will take possibly 5 minutes to read what's below you will have a great understanding of what is going to happen to AMC. ITS GOING TO BE FUCKING INSANITY

You guys seriously don't know what's about to happen, this has been setup since the first squeeze in February and if you DON'T read what's below you WON'T know what to do with your stock. YOU WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY SEE 100% TO 500% GAINS POSSIBLY MORE

Basically in February when AMC had its ""short squeeze"" the hedge funds were fucked, right, they bet billions of dollars on like a couple dollar per share shorts so when that went up to $10 to $15 to $20 per share, the hedge funds were fucked, right, they had to cover they're shorts and it would put them hundreds of billions in debt. however to cover a short you can either pay it off, or borrow more shorts form the brokerage, they lend out short shares that are expected to be paid back. usually a company has hundreds of millions of short shares available. so when it had that squeeze back in February the hedge funds had to cover their shorts which was billions of dollars, but, they didn't have to cover ALL of their shorts because AMC will MAKE hedge funds pay a fraction of the shorts that they owe (usually when the price reaches highs and brokerages get scared) and then let them borrow the rest. and that's what they did. they kept borrowing shares so that they didn't have to pay the hundreds of billions that they owe. however after the squeeze since the hedge funds still had most of their shorts to cover since they borrowed even more instead of paying them off, they were still trying to get the most out of debt possible, and to do that they had to keep shorting it. WELL MOTHERFUCKERS IT IS TIME. THEY HAVE JUST BEEN CONSTANTLY SHORTING IT FOR MONTHS. THERE ARE NO MORE SHORTS AVAILABLE TO BORROW. THE HEDGEFUNDS ARE HAVING TO PAY PAY BECAUSE LIKE I WAS TALKING ABOUT EARLIER YOU CAN EITHER PAY OR BORROW MORE AND THERE SIMPLY ISNT ANYMORE TO BORROW THEY HAVE TO FUCKING PAY THE HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THEYVE BEEN PUTTING OFF FOR THE LAST 3 MONTHS. AND BETTER YET THE STOCK HAS TRIPLED THIS WEEK AND THE HEDGEFUNDS HAVE PAYED CLOSE TO 0% OF WHAT THEY OWE. THEY HAVENT EVEN STARTED TO PAY YET.

2. Do not buy before 10:30 AM. Also, sell in premarket. There is a sucker at the other end.
3. Learn about OCO orders.
4. Do not pick stocks. Pick ETFs. And because it is Wallstreetbets, go for 3X leverage.
5. Do DCA ( or yolo)
6. Yolo money you can afford to loose. Or live under the bridge.
7. Do not buy the stock you just sold ( or short it).
8. Short mortgage stocks, All of them are shit.
9. Coin goes up, short MARA, RIOT, SQ, COIN.

Fundamentally, the stock is worth $45-$50 based on comparable peer P/E, current growth performance and great financial metrics.

9944,,2021-05-28 23:18:52,t3_nnac8t,,wallstreetbets,"Several reasons why I am bullish on BYND: 

High short interest. According to Ortex, its percentage of float shorted has grown to 27%, on par with or higher than GME (21%), AMC (17%), and BB (9%). 

The squeeze just started. Other squeezes have been occurring for months and have pushed their share prices to many times their prior levels. The more a stock rises, the less future runway it has and the more room it has to fall.  The BYND squeeze just started this week. BYND is less than 65% of its all-time high and only 75% of its local high set in January. It has another 25% to go before it reaches its price set in January.    

Improving fundamentals. Overseas expansion and numerous partnerships: McDonald‚Äôs, KFC, Pizza Hut, Yum, Taco Bell. Its double upgrade this week was the first in its history as a public company. It now has two consecutive upgrades. This raises the possibility that institutional investors are coming into the stock as well as retail investors, as well as funds that might cover their shorts. Most of the other short targets have had more downgrades than upgrades recently. 

Additional motivation. It would be great to see BYND rise to a level that would allow it to get more capital for R&D on more favorable terms. BYND is great for the environment and animals and people have motivation to see it succeed.",nnac8t,Reasons to be bullish on BYND
9945,,2021-05-28 23:35:22,t3_nnamqq,,wallstreetbets,"So a lot of people are saying that there are millions of synthetic shares created by the Hedgefunds. 

If the shares are counted by votes which is supposed to happen on 6/2/21, then all the Hedgefunds have to do is not vote, right? How does share voting/count work? 

How will they prove that synthetic shares exist if not many people participate in the count? Is it mandatory?

Is the current short interest enough to initiate a short squeeze? I think it's only at 17% at the moment, seems a little low to be honest.
