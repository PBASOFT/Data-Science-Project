So please, before you or anyone else tries defending their pathetic performance in the SF250, explain why they were driving so slow.

You know what is common to going slow and low efficiency, the physics of unsprung mass.

Oh, as to brake assemblies... does not the endurance also need brakes?

Whatever. This race turned out as one would expect for a car built with too much unsprung mass. At this point, my view is that I will believe LMC will get this to successful mass production when I see it. My bet is they will end up bankrupt sooner or later (well their money is enough to keep them rolling for a while, but it too will run out eventually).",,

Because of diversification, you won't be destroyed when a single stock underperforms, but your returns are not going to to be stellar.

(Not a financial advice)

Starting from the basics. The first step in any technical analysis, should be to identify the current major trend, including both a short term and a longer term scales. Referring back to April 2020, and up to the first half of December 2020, the consolidation of a flat nature (with several expansions) is prevalent - in the price action diapason of $9.5 to 11 dollars as the upper resistance. As 2021 was approaching, during the last days of December, an extensive upward impulse took place, flirting with $14 resistance level. 
From the current perspective, that rapid price movement looks like a conventional bull trap, to get poor animals slaughtered fast and cruel. And the commencing consequently nasty downtrend supports that proposition - starting on the 28th of December and lasting up to the 11th of May. Talking about a week long period, there is a retracement bull-run apparent, still in action.

The bearish four and a half month old trend outlined above should be of a prior interest for us here, because it is the major market setup to play in currently. As for the next step, it‚Äôs a good idea to grope the key downtrend resistance levels, which will both magnet the price action as well as recalcitrating it should the price action come near. The first and the most powerful resistance line should be drawn from the lowest point of Dec 28 daily candle‚Äôs tail, and include the following apexes: on Feb 4 (not touched, but not far); Mar 4; Mar 18; Apr 29 and May 13. Based on how this resistance surpassed the price action, it is appropriate to consider it the most important resistance the bears had in hands. As it had been broken the day before yesterday, it may be viewed as a bullish signal.

With a caution, definitely. Because there is the second most important downtrend resistance overhanging: just connect the December 28th daily candle‚Äôs opening price point with Dec 29, Jan 4 & 11 apexes, and the third of March shot opening price.

Moving further, another important tool worthy to be applied here is Fibonacci retracement (who would have guessed?). The starting point of the downtrend measurement being easily identifiable (28 Dec), and the final price point is not too difficult to find here too (the bottom low of $6.33 on May 11). You should notice, how well Fibo applies here, and how the price action confirms that by playing with these levels and in between those. Recently $8.13 (23.6% Fibo level) was conquered, but there is a significant resistance at $9.24 (38.2% retr.) and another solid one at $10.14 (50%). This price diapason ($9-10) seems to be insurmountable as a resistance zone from the current point of view, coupled with the 150 daily simple MA and the second resistance described in the previous paragraph, all converging in this zone.

Speaking about volume, the increase is evident recently. However, in order for the price action to conquer the resistance zone outlined above, a lot more (and I mean A LOT) buying volume is necessary.

MACD and StochRSI indicate the incipient bullish momentum, rolling up from the bearish zone and both pointing up.

TL;DR: So, buy UWMC? Dunno. Overall, a mixed setup, with additional confirmations necessary in order to enter the trade confidently. The reversal of a four and a half months downtrend is apparent, but the outstanding selling pressure (elaborated above) coming from $9-10 diapason looks scary to me. The best play for now would be sitting out and observing from the distance, with a careful entry as soon as $10 level (and preferably $11) is broken and confirmed as a support afterwards. YMCA looks solid though.

First thing I notice is that periods of high variance returns are not sustained and they look possibly isolated, although there minor spikes before each big one.

https://preview.redd.it/ln6677wul1071.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c72c82557c3045a9575d857189931a84a693c24

On the other hand it looks like medium variance and low variance are in a constant switch off. We can see the almost perfect inversion between low variance probabilities and medium.

https://preview.redd.it/eqnl6ctzl1071.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f75444f4a5a854e7d842bb7f212c378c442f928

Most of those high variance returns come from changes from low to high variance. 

https://preview.redd.it/awjv82x4m1071.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=840a93a87d1745f84d79964cc296b8b282ff4153

This shows that high variance returns are more like *surprises* in the market because they come from low variance returns, its not a gradual buildup.  

**QQQ results**

QQQ‚Äôs results are very similar to SPY‚Äôs results. 

https://preview.redd.it/bqavsxmam1071.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad8be59558f24274d2ac689fa83e8c7a629de55

It seems like there are not *precursor* spikes in high variance returns, and the occur in isolation.  In this case it does seem like there is a sustained period of high variance returns in the early 2000s.  

https://preview.redd.it/gp4sc5yem1071.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=73c238b2a8657a2ada87e458ebc27140654a352f

The same cyclical inverse pattern occurs within the low and medium level regimes.

https://preview.redd.it/qqkq714km1071.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=899816666e35168b5e1756ee58dba86013739f5c

And consistent with SPY it seems like high variance regime spikes come from low variance to high variance.

https://preview.redd.it/cb5o3v2om1071.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89f554112e2b8dd2d79904a6aa6249b3326a31a

**Conclusions / Future areas to investigate**

¬∑ In CBOE VIX data is was common for large spikes in high variance to come from medium variance regimes, that does not seem to be the case for SPY or QQQ most of the high variance spikes come from changes from low variance to high variance

¬∑ Both QQQ and SPY exhibited what look like to be an inverse relationship between low and medium variance regimes. Confirming results and possibly making indicators could be comparing covariances and trends between the time series and then if a there is a *shift* that is probably a *break* in the relationship which probably leads to a time of high variance

¬∑ QQQ did exhibit high variance regime for a longer sustained time and that may be because of its growth-orientation.

 I hope to turn the codebase into a python-only repo so I can analyze the time series in a notebook a publish more of my findings.

[$GC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/dudwlorvi3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb931a041ddf4f5b79d58c008d4badcb8b91b7c2)

First - let's take a look at the **1 year 1 day** chart. Here - we are breaking what appears to just be a broadening descending wedge (a massive one). The breakout point was **1853 -** and it needs to hold **1848** to stay intact. 

You can see we already got some follow through here. Now, price targets/resistances are **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3.** 

Keep in mind - the larger the pattern, the larger the move, **the longer it takes to play out.** This isn't going to happen overnight. Timeframe to complete the move is **3-6 months** \- and we could form lots of smaller patterns in between.

Every time we cross one of those resistances, it should become a support. Also note that upon reaching them, it's likely we consolidate for a few days. Overall - a super clean setup, and a play I've been eyeing since March. 

Lastly, keep in mind - for a setup of this magnitude, you want the **weekly close** for confirmation.

But - what makes this really interesting is the **10 year 1 week chart.**

[$GC 10 Year 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/ejdwc9xvj3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bdfbd8e014548cda17aaf6e754e28cd9abf651f)

Here, we have an absolutely massive cup and handle dating back to 2011. In this context - the addition of this data mainly means we can look for a much higher price target on the wedge breakout. 

As a result - I'm targeting $GC **2250 - 2500** within the next **year.** Remember what I said about timeframes. This could take quite a while. For this setup to trigger - I'm looking for the **monthly close** above that first breakout point.

And... that's it. Remember, technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. Fake outs can and do happen. That's why we identify **key levels** to tell where we are within a setup. Take it step by step.

***TL;DR -*** 

$GC above 1853 weekly close targets **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3**

$GC above 1853 monthly close targets **2250, 2500**

I'm planning to continue doing weekly relative rotation analysis of the market, but wanted to create this mid week post to take a quick look at UWMC. Please let me know if another flair is more appropriate.

I'm not going to get into the financials, since plenty of solid DD has been done on that already. However, I did mention in my last post (analyzing the market sectors) that I would look into positions related to the real estate sector (XLRE).

My thought process here it to take a look at the short term momentum for this stock due to the recent positive earnings, great financials, positive future outlook, and upcoming June Ex-Div date.

Lets jump into it and make it quick...

Since there is a lot of talk regarding Russell inclusion, here is the RRG of UWMC again UWM:

**My Thoughts:**

Personally, the company has strong fundamentals. So, in combination with the momentum, I think its a decent ""buy"" (this is not professional financial advice).

I'm playing this 3 ways:

6/18 short put x 2 @ $7

7/16 long call x 5 @ $6

1100 shares @ $8.06

What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either.

1321,,2021-05-19 20:14:45,t3_ngftx1,,wallstreetbets,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",ngftx1,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Mr. Cramer..."

Big tech's earnings absolutely destroyed estimates but sell side thinks it's due to lock down and people will rely on tech less once things open up. It's a consistent pattern that all the gains made after earning erode overnight or in a few trading session as if the good earning did not happen.

1324,,2021-05-19 20:51:00,t3_nggpql,,wallstreetbets,"I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

1326,,2021-05-19 21:25:26,t3_nghmhm,,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",nghmhm,$NUE is strong as steel. Buy the dips.

Petco earnings is tomorrow pre-market. But this also might be a potential candidate for a short squeeze.

Short sellers are gearing up for a bad quarter. For the last three days, the short float increased from 4 point-something Monday, 6.05 yesterday, and today it's at 8.75.

In addition, short interest is up to 35.2%

To top it off, there are hardly any shares available to short, though borrowing rate remains at only 1%. For the last five days there were no more than 100k shares left to short.

The average price target is $28, but if earnings goes better than expected, this could be the catalyst for something significantly bigger. Listen to your pets' beckoning calls, and keep this on your watch list!

We‚Äôve had a run up of 55% from 5/6-5/17 to $14.38 high on 5/17.  Slight gain of 0.6% on 5/18 (similar to the slight drop on 3/19 with freaky similar volume changes) and then the massive sell off decline on 5/19 of (9.9%) is eerily similar to the (10.3%) drop on 3/22.......

Potential to give up all of the gains since 5/6 by this Friday and puts are ridiculously cheap in the $10 below range for 5/21 and 5/28.  If AMC goes on a similar slide to the March slide, there will be massive returns on these ridiculously cheap put options (9.9% decline today and the sub $10 puts barely moved in price on both the 5/21 and 5/28 expiration dates.

Cheap way to place a bet if the squeeze doesn‚Äôt materialize that could be a >10x return based on how cheap the <$10 puts are for 5/21 and 5/28 put options.

If you are holding stock, max gains you are getting for $20 is ~2x but this could be the real money maker with puts sub $10 priced at $0.01-$0.05 that could go to $0.5+ if the stock slides similar to the March slide.

1338,,2021-05-20 05:24:49,t3_ngrqqf,,wallstreetbets,"Some context: Cell carriers in the US have decided to stop the function of shared short codes (5-6 digit phone numbers) June 1. Shared short codes were the preferred means of SMS and MMS communication for B2C traffic. Short codes were free to lease in many cases, text messages were cheap, thousands of businesses could send from the same number, and throughput was incredibly high (lots of messages could be sent very fast).

The new policy enforced by the CTIA (The private club all major cell phone carriers are in) is that shared short codes are to be discontinued and replaced by dedicated short codes and A2P 10dlc (approved B2C traffic on 10-digit phone numbers). This means that every business/organization that wants to send texts must either apply for a dedicated short code or apply for a 10DLC. 

Dedicated short codes are the preferred choice for large corporations. They can handle large throughput and look good for the brand. However, they only cater to large corporations because they are thousands of dollars/year to lease. Turn around time for application is 4-6 weeks. Barrier to entry is high.

10DLC is the preferred choice for the smaller businesses since it's less expensive. But, it is still far more expensive than the shared short codes businesses are used to, requires application, and costs $50/mo in carrier and registration fees alone. Turn around time for application is less than a week. On top of fees, 10dlc isn't even fully ready. The Campaign Registry, the organization responsible for rolling out ""the new messaging standard"" for the CTIA, is still developing their API.

Enter Toll-free messaging. TF has 0 barrier to entry and can be issued to a business with SMS and MMS capabilities in seconds. It's the easiest and now the most cost-effective way to send commercial messages.

Conveniently, every major carrier announced this month (for the first time) that they will start collecting a $0.0025/message fee for every sms sent. They're ready for and expecting businesses to move to this method.

Who is Zipwhip: Zipwhip was given full reign over all TF traffic. Anyone in the US  that wants to send messages on TF codes uses Zipwhip in one way or another. They are a massive reseller that everyone is required to go through.

It was recently announced the Twilio plans on acquiring Zipwhip for $850M. Twilio is the leader is programmable messaging hands down. 

Honestly, there should be antitrust issues that arise and block the acquisition. If it goes through, Twilio owns the new world of business sms. Good chance regulators won't notice any issue. They'll miss the fact that businesses will be pressured into TF over their preferred solutions (dedicated short codes and A2P 10DLC) since it's unnecessarily complicated and expensive. TF is ready now and cheap.

TL;DR if Twilio successfully acquires Zipwhip, every small to medium sized business that wants to send texts will have to go through them. Every single one of them in the US.",ngrqqf,$TWLO stands to be the primary source for commercial text messaging

1341,,2021-05-20 08:25:07,t3_ngulnq,,wallstreetbets,"So just how big is **today's news about the initial success of the Sofusa technology**?

1st, this is a technology that aims at lymphatic delivery. 

**What does this mean?** Well, when trying to fight a disease, it's difficult to target the lymphatic system. Because of how it works and the fact that it is spread throughout our body. 

So there are MANY, MANY drugs out there that treat several conditions through the lymphatic system. But, because of what we just explained, those drugs sometimes don't work. They are not properly ""delivered"". They don't get to where they need to get to make the necessary interaction and solve the problem.

**Sorrento has developed a technology that can deliver drugs to where they actually need to go** in the lymphatic system. So this is definitely breakthrough technology. Other companies are aiming to find similar solutions. But we are definitely talking about very advanced bio-tech.

In this case, we have a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. This is a condition that worsens with time. It's very painful and limits the patient's movement. It's not very common, so we are talking about 1.5 million people in the USA and about 30 million worldwide. 

But remember, **the technology Sorrento is developing  will be able to deliver drugs treating many other diseases** related to the lymphatic system. So the market for Sofusa is very, very large.

The press release tells us Sofusa was tested on ""First Enbrel-Non-Responding"" patients. 

**What does this mean?** Patients who need the drug Enbrel and, even though they have not been taking the drug for long (it's a ""first"" for them) they are not responding to it. It isn't helping them. 

Now, Sofusa comes into play. It's job is to deliver Enbrel to the patient effectively. To ""take"" Enbrel to where it needs to go in the lymphatic system.. 

The 1st obvious advantage is that the drug wasn't helping and now helps. But there are other important advantages.

Since the drug is being carried to its targeted ""destination"" the dosage needed, diminishes. Because less is ""lost along the way"". This is important because many diseases related to the lymphatic system, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are chronic, lifelong conditions. Being able to administer less drugs really helps the patient. Now you have a drug that actually works, more potently, which reduces its dosage. All this thanks to Sorrento.

The press release points out an important factor: This is a trial on ONE type of drug/treatment. Other such trials testing the effectiveness of Sofusa are already taking place. Again, this is proof of the potentially huge market for this delivery system.

Just to get an idea, the release mentions anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. These are a type of drugs that inhibit the activity of certain proteins (they inhibit PD1 and CTLA4, which are types of proteins. By stopping their activity, they help in stopping the growth of cancer tumors). There are several drugs that fall under these categories and treat a wide variety of cancers. **Sofusa can potentially play a vital role in all these treatments**. 

This is like several companies developing apps while Sorrento is developing a new smartphone technology. Each app has its rightful use and market. But once the new smartphone is up and working, all apps will need it. So this technology has huge revenue implications. T**he fact we are hearing good news about it is HUGE**.

As for the results themselves: **The DAS28 test measures rheumatoid activity in 28 joints** in the patient's body. The joints might be swollen or tender (hurting).

This patient had a DAS28 score of 4.6, with 18 out of 28 joints compromised.  That is considered  moderate to high disease activity.  There are 4 levels of DAS 28 scores going from remission (the best) to high (the worst). So this patient was not in the worst shape going in, but pretty bad.

Using Sofusa to deliver the Enbrel drug, in just 4 weeks (this is a very short time for this type of disease!!) the results went from 4.6 to 3.0. The total amount of compromised joints, from 18 to 11. **That is a dramatic change**. The patient went from being somewhere between level 3 and 4, to being in the lower level 2, called ""low disease activity"", which indicates it's moving towards remission (the lowest level). For someone suffering from this condition, it's a real life changer. For the company selling Enbrel, it's a real market changer. And if it can equally help people with tumors, **Sofusa becomes a major therapeutic factor.** 

I hope investors understand this. **It's another major development in an already extremely promising pipeline** which is currently badly undervalued. If the price doesn't spike today by 10-15%, as it should, just from this news, it would be disappointing. 

But if you are long, today's price change isn't what matters the most. It‚Äôs the understanding that Sorrento / SRNE has ANOTHER ace in its hand!",ngulnq,How Big is SRNE news release about Sofusa success?

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC and its +23% run in the past week. A stock with a massive dividend. A stock trading with a very low P/E of and income growth of 4,200%.

So why is this stock still a buy and hold for me right now?

The CEO is positioning them to increase shareholder value, but also position the company to weather any reduction in the refi market. (65% of the business)

There are major catalysts that have been driving the increase in price that goes beyond the attention gained on WSB.

* Announced **NET earnings of $860M in the first quarter,** with huge margins.
* Reaffirmed a continued dividend, the next ex-dividend date is **6/9/2021**.
* Announced a **$300M stock buyback, representing as much as 40% of the free float** at the current prices.
* Russell index inclusion was missed last quarter due to confusion about their PREVIOUS status as a SPAC. It is expected that they will be reconsidered for Russell Index inclusions in the yearly reconstitution. While not the biggest catalyst, this is a sign of reputation and long-term stability for the stock. **The prelim list publishes 6/4/2021.**
* Creation of a jumbo mortgage product. The average loan origination in the market is \~410,000, indicating that the non-conforming section of the mortgage market is *exploding.* This is a very profitable sector of loan origination.

Other fundamentals driving a buy recommendation:

* Small float. 90M float, of which only about 60M is freely trading.
* This stock is not persistently pressured down quite as hard as others due to low share availability, but it appears based on the last two weeks it's trading the small waves of this stock to try to push it down under dangerous strike prices. A wave of positive sentiment could strangle this position in the stock. I don't have a Bloomberg terminal, but based on the evidence over the last several days, the indication is the 13.1% SI has grown.
* Exceptional open option interest for **tomorrow 5/21/2021.** The options expiring tomorrow have been documented elsewhere so I won't belabor them, but the open interest at the $9, and $10 strike represent almost 10% of the free float.
* Not a new startup, **they have been in this business since 1986**, making them almost as old as a fossil like me. They clearly survived the 2008 storm. This company isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

The cherry:

* **STILL forecasting growth in Q2**, whereas many of its competitors are not.

This post is NOT financial advice, but as someone who has ridden the waves of this stock since it was about $9, I see this position turning positive and the outlook through July for this position has high sentiment. Even if the mortgage market slows down as expected, I will hold these shares for years to come for the dividends and general stability of the organization.

My position 8000 shares @ 7.65 and 45x 6/18 8c. You can go stalk the fuck out of me if you want to see that I've been talking about this stock for some time and been saying the same thing about the strength and targets of their position since March. I am also the guy that tells you when you unintentionally reveal personal info on your yolo screenshots!

TLDR: UWMC should garner close attention for value investors looking for undervalued positions.

1352,,2021-05-20 13:28:43,t3_nh08j4,,wallstreetbets,"**Investment Thesis**

Overall, what makes MDXG a good buying opportunity right now is a combination of two factors.

* Number one is management‚Äôs miscommunication with the market. The market currently believes that wound care is the core business of MDXG, is not entirely aware of the potential of its biopharma pipeline and more specifically its Amniofix drug, and has priced the company based on this.¬†
* Number two is the huge potential of the Amniofix treatment and its ability to become the next blockbuster in the healthcare space after the conclusion of its phase 3 trial.

**Idea Summary**

MiMedx Group *(MDXG)* is a leading BioPharma and wound care business whose value has been drastically misunderstood by the market. Through drivers such as miscommunication from management about the company‚Äôs valued proposition as well as the lack of institutional investor coverage, the market currently believes that the majority of the company‚Äôs value sits in its low growth wound care business. In reality, its major competitive advantage is within its osteoarthritis drug Amniofix which has the potential to become the next blockbuster after it clears phase III clinical trials. A sum of the parts valuation was used to determine a minimum implied upside of at least 300%. Risks are discussed at the end.

**Business Overview**

MiMedx Group is a leading biopharma and advanced wound care business utilizing human placental tissues to develop products used in the healthcare sector. It processes placental tissues using its patented processes to produce allografts, which are tissues transplanted from one person to another for wound care and regeneration. These allografts are effective in healing difficult wounds because of the ability of the allograft cells to quickly associate with the cells of the patient, thereby taking part in the healing process, easing the ability of the body to close the wound, and speeding up the body‚Äôs regeneration process.

MDXG‚Äôs product offerings can be split into two business segments: wound care and biopharma (surgical solutions). Its flagship product Epifix and additional product Epicord fall under its wound care umbrella, and its flagship product Amniofix as well as additional products Amniocord, Amniofill, and Epiburn fall under its biopharma umbrella. The wound care products service the broad wound care industry, targeting specifically chronic wounds. The biopharma product line is more specific, with the flagship treatment Amniofix targeting knee osteoarthritis in specific.¬†

MDXG sells through direct sales, sales agents, and distributors in the United States. This past quarter, 95% of its sales were direct to customers such as healthcare professionals and facilities.¬†

**Internal Analysis**

The past 3 years have not been ideal for MDXG. Its revenues began to dip in 2018 around the time of their accounting scandal, the growth went from 40% in 2018, to 11% in 2019, and is currently around -16%. This sent their stock price tumbling from $16 USD to lows of almost $1 USD, though it is currently trading at $9 with new updates on their biopharma pipeline.

Their gross margin has stayed very high, around 80% while their EBITDA margins have dropped over the years. Though it wasn‚Äôt explicitly disclosed, a large part of this drop in EBITDA margins has been attributed to a temporary increase in legal fees due to the litigation MDXG has faced this past year. Its decreased volume may have also suppressed margins as the number of wound care treatments in hospitals significantly dropped during COVID-19.¬†

The company‚Äôs cash balance is sitting at a very high level of 84 mm. This is in large part due to its recent capital raise, which happened to be strongly criticized by one of MDXG‚Äôs activist investors, Prescience Point Capital (discussed in detail later).

**External Analysis**

*Wound Care Market*

The global wound care market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% from 2021 to 2028. This has been driven by the aging population and rising rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Wound care products are increasingly being used to prevent and surgical site infections.¬†

Though the overall market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% the specific advanced product segment which includes products such as those of MDXG‚Äôs which target chronic and non-healing wounds, is projected to grow much faster than 4.1%.¬†

The wound care market is relatively fragmented, with large players such as Integra LifeSciences, 3M, Johnson & Johnson, and Medtronic competing to gain the most market share. MDXG‚Äôs direct competition for its allograft advanced wound care treatments include Organogenesis, Axogen, Mediwound, and Vericel.¬†

Organogenesis is currently in the lead in this niche market, and while MDXG reported an 11% YoY decline in sales in 2020 (which has already been factored into the current price), Organogenesis reported a 30% increase. This is evident when comparing the stock performance of both companies over the past year (figure 1)

*Osteoarthritis Therapy Market*

91 million U.S. adults have arthritis, 20M have knee OA, and \~32 million per year are currently treated for plantar fasciitis, which is specifically targeted by MDXG‚Äôs Amniofix drug. There are very few FDA approved treatments for knee OA and plantar fasciitis, and those that exist have low efficacy and many drawbacks. Amniofix is currently the only treatment of its nature in phase 3 clinical trials that have posted very positive results in both company and independent trials, has been used off-label by >100K patients with zero severe adverse effects, and consistently demonstrates a significant reduction in pain as reported by patients. In addition, Amniofix has an RMAT (regenerative medicine advanced therapy) designation granted by the FDA which allows for MDXG to benefit from an expedited approval process from the FDA.

*Management Miscommunication*

The current market opinion of MDXG has been blurred by the miscommunication from company management whose goals do not align with maximizing shareholder value. This is largely due to the fact that EW healthcare, a private equity firm, has 33% representation on the board as a result of its 17% stake. From a corporate finance perspective, a private equity firm‚Äôs interests do not generally tend to align with those of public shareholders. Their influence has been exacerbated by the fact that there are no large institutional holdings in MDXG as of yet other than Prescience Point, and there has been minimal coverage on the stock leading to the market‚Äôs opinion on the company being heavily skewed by management communications.¬†

MDXG‚Äôs current growth strategy is focused on roll-ups in the wound care space. This is very characteristic of a private equity playbook, and goes alongside EW‚Äôs historical acquisitions. As was mentioned in the external analysis, the wound care space is growing at a slow rate of \~4.1%, however MDXG has lost significant market share to Organogenesis. Management has failed to realize that the current value driver of the business is within its biopharma line and not its wound care line, yet has continually communicated to shareholders that it believes it is in fact wound care and it is going to continue investing in growing within the industry.

Prescience Point Capital, an activist investor group which has advocated for change in MDXG's communication strategy, has supported the fact that MDXG‚Äôs communications have been focused on the wrong industry. At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, the potential for the drug Amniofix was drastically undersold and much time was spent convincing investors that the core business is in wound care. The 3.6% decline in shares two days after the conference illustrates how effective this strategy was.¬†

There has been strong opposition from MDXG‚Äôs board of directors to Prescience Point‚Äôs activist efforts. In a shareholder letter in early May, prior to their annual meeting, the company communicated that they believe the wound care and regenerative medicine direction being followed now is ideal. They stated that the activist investor does not understand pharmaceutical company disclosure and were advocating for speculative actions themselves though Prescience‚Äôs report discusses the opposite, with them outlining how EW‚Äôs influence on the board of directors is shifting the company‚Äôs focus away from maximizing shareholder value.

*Amniofix*

As mentioned in the external analysis, there is currently no other treatment, either in development or on the market, as effective as Amniofix in treating knee OA and also just as safe. Most recently, at its Q1 earnings call, MDXG CEO shared positive results from the phase IIb prospective trial of the treatment. There was a statistically significant reduction in VAS (visual analog score) for pain and an improvement in the foot function index score. There were also no serious adverse events during this clinical trial. Amniofix is currently in phase III trials, and MDXG believes they are on target to meet all criteria needed to find a biologics license application (BLA) so that the treatment can be introduced to the general public. MDXG is aiming to file their BLA in the first half of 2022, meaning that within a year this blockbuster treatment could be on the market, and given the feedback so far from clinical trials as well as the RMAT designation, it is highly likely.

A Prescience Point market capture analysis estimated that the treatment would bring in $4,050 million of annual sales. This is \~8 times higher than the current sales brought in through wound care. One year ago it would have been prudent to not entirely incorporate this into the share price, however today with clinical trials nearing completion and MDXG‚Äôs new RMAT designation, the likelihood of approval is much higher.

**Valuation**

From a valuation point of view, a quick sum of the parts analysis is the most ideal given the two different business lines of MDXG. A more in-depth DCF can be created once more cost information is provided from MDXG after the conclusion of clinical trials.

Shares outstanding of 109.8 mm, total debt of 51.8 mm, and total cash of 84.7mm were used to convert from enterprise value to equity value. The current implied upside was calculated using the current price of $9.46.

*Wound Care Valuation*

MDXG‚Äôs FY 2021 sales guidance assumed $255 mm to $270 mm in revenue from the wound care segment. Different points in this revenue ranged were used for the low, base, and high cases of the valuation. An EV/Revenue multiple was used to calculate implied enterprise value. The comparables analysis shown in figure 2 illustrated the median multiples derived from the analysis done using the aforementioned list of MDXG‚Äôs competitors. A median multiple of 5.3x was used. The median was used and not marked down because the gross margin and UFCF yield of MDXG is in-line with all competitors. Though the EBIDTA multiple was lower, the similar yield and gross margins indicate that company performance is relatively the same. In addition, litigation expenses factored into the lower EBIDTA multiples and thus it is not indicative of recurring performance.

Based on the revenue multiples, implied share values for the wound care segment range between $12.0 and $12.8.

**Wound Care Equity Value**

**Biopharma Valuation**

Prescience Point estimated annual revenues from Amniofix through using the market capture method. The total market size (annual knee OA injections) was estimated, and a capture percentage was applied to determine the annual number of patients receiving the Amniofix injection. Prescience assumed 1.5 injections per year but to be more conservative in this valuation 1 was used. Price per injection and FDA approval probability varied by the cases and were used to adjust the EV/Rev multiple downwards. Overall, an implied share value range between $25.4 and $57.1 was calculated for this segment.

https://preview.redd.it/we0pw4jm1a071.png?width=611&format=png&auto=webp&s=567d19cc5acc59acbe552a2afcf09789c80866ff

**Biopharma Equity Value**

Overall, the total implied share price ranges between $37.43 to $69.81. As more information regarding Amniofix comes out including the price of manufacturing, different multiples can be used to fine-tune the analysis.

https://preview.redd.it/a8035yfo1a071.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=12e0f9a041e326b505bfda25304261367c651406

**Risks**

1. Given the high influence EW healthcare has on the board of directors, there is potential for more value to describe acquisitions such as that of stability biologics, which was bought for 10 million and sold for 3.5 million 3 years later. If such a trend continues, the value of MDXG‚Äôs wound care business can dramatically decrease, which will hurt the share pierce
2. The FDA approval of Amniofix is a large driver of the valuation calculated. There is a large risk that the FDA will not approve the treatment, however, with the RMAT designation in place and positive results from the first two phases of clinical trials, the odds are strongly in the favour of the approval at the current point in time.

If you aren't familiar with the efficient frontier, what it tries to find is the *mean-variance portfolio.* This type of model deals with portfolio management / optimization. In terms of the efficient frontier you are trying to find the best portfolio allocation weights that give you the best risk adjusted returns. 

**In simple words:** you give it stocks and it tells you the best percentage holdings

I recently built an app on some python code that does this sort of optimization. There is no programming required to use the app. When running the app it will give two portfolios, minimum variance, and maximized sharpe (same as mean-variance, mean-markowitz). Minimum variance will tell you the least riskiest holding strategy (green), and max sharpe will give you the best reward-for-risk holding (red). I call that portfolio *the-juice-is-worth-the-squeeze.* Here is a sample output. 

&#x200B;

I used around 100,000 simulations, and 10Y of adjusted close data. 

The reason why I bring this up is because it does two things. The first is that it promotes portfolio diversification, which I know is pretty uncommon here. Also it finds the most aggressive returns in terms of minimizing risk. If you have high returns and wonder why you returns are so much higher than standard investment funds its probably because you are here

Yah you may good returns, you are probably taking on more risk than what you are getting in return.

&#x200B;

**If your brain has folds in it:**

Essentially the code is using a monte carlo simulation to solve this optimization problem.

And I remembered that trump signed a mandate for the department of defense to release a document about all their info on UFOs.  And a thought occurred to me that the alien report in June is gonna send space stonks to the moon.  So I did a couple weeks of DD and found two etfs I liked ARKX and UFO which held a broad band of stocks within the space sector.  I don‚Äôt think the government will actually come out and say their will be aliens.  But the CIA has declassified all their info already, congressional members are calling for it, as well as getting picked up on media.  So even if they don‚Äôt say aliens they will still have to admit it‚Äôs an unidentifiable object, so either aliens or advanced foreign tech.  Either way it will push this sector into prominence as it won‚Äôt just be a sector for rich billionaires but as a necessity for the future, to match foreign power‚Äôs tech or to do deep space exploration.  ARKX has cathie woods behind it and could be an attractive prospect to more traditional investors that would have never considered investing in space stocks before.

How high could it go? Well If we take a look at the graph below, we can see that SPCE peaked at around 60 bucks  back in February in ANTICIPATION for the previous test flight which was delayed until May for safety reasons (They had some problems with electromagnetic interference which is fixed now).

So if the test flight actually happens on the 22nd, then could be really big boom. Currently the price is around 18-19 bucks, so it's an absolute steal in my opinion, but there is always the risk that some shit fucks up and the test flight is delayed even further, in which case I will have to sell the house.

And before any of you autistic fucks say that SpaceX is better, just keep in mind that Virgin Galactic is playing a whole different game. SpaceX is trying to go to Mars, and Virgin Galactic is just trying to do some space tourism. Also keep in mind that Virgin Galactic was founded 2 whole years after SpaceX, so SpaceX has had a bit of a head start.

You would have to have shorts to squeeze in first place, and we did the first time around, squeezed the bastard so much it increased over 7000%, even the most ludicrous squeezes in history never hit that amount, the craziest price increases usually stop at 3000%.

First thing I notice is that periods of high variance returns are not sustained and they look possibly isolated, although there minor spikes before each big one.

https://preview.redd.it/ln6677wul1071.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c72c82557c3045a9575d857189931a84a693c24

On the other hand it looks like medium variance and low variance are in a constant switch off. We can see the almost perfect inversion between low variance probabilities and medium.

https://preview.redd.it/eqnl6ctzl1071.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f75444f4a5a854e7d842bb7f212c378c442f928

Most of those high variance returns come from changes from low to high variance. 

https://preview.redd.it/awjv82x4m1071.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=840a93a87d1745f84d79964cc296b8b282ff4153

This shows that high variance returns are more like *surprises* in the market because they come from low variance returns, its not a gradual buildup.  

**QQQ results**

QQQ‚Äôs results are very similar to SPY‚Äôs results. 

https://preview.redd.it/bqavsxmam1071.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad8be59558f24274d2ac689fa83e8c7a629de55

It seems like there are not *precursor* spikes in high variance returns, and the occur in isolation.  In this case it does seem like there is a sustained period of high variance returns in the early 2000s.  

https://preview.redd.it/gp4sc5yem1071.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=73c238b2a8657a2ada87e458ebc27140654a352f

The same cyclical inverse pattern occurs within the low and medium level regimes.

https://preview.redd.it/qqkq714km1071.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=899816666e35168b5e1756ee58dba86013739f5c

And consistent with SPY it seems like high variance regime spikes come from low variance to high variance.

https://preview.redd.it/cb5o3v2om1071.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89f554112e2b8dd2d79904a6aa6249b3326a31a

**Conclusions / Future areas to investigate**

¬∑ In CBOE VIX data is was common for large spikes in high variance to come from medium variance regimes, that does not seem to be the case for SPY or QQQ most of the high variance spikes come from changes from low variance to high variance

¬∑ Both QQQ and SPY exhibited what look like to be an inverse relationship between low and medium variance regimes. Confirming results and possibly making indicators could be comparing covariances and trends between the time series and then if a there is a *shift* that is probably a *break* in the relationship which probably leads to a time of high variance

¬∑ QQQ did exhibit high variance regime for a longer sustained time and that may be because of its growth-orientation.

 I hope to turn the codebase into a python-only repo so I can analyze the time series in a notebook a publish more of my findings.

[$GC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/dudwlorvi3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb931a041ddf4f5b79d58c008d4badcb8b91b7c2)

First - let's take a look at the **1 year 1 day** chart. Here - we are breaking what appears to just be a broadening descending wedge (a massive one). The breakout point was **1853 -** and it needs to hold **1848** to stay intact. 

You can see we already got some follow through here. Now, price targets/resistances are **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3.** 

Keep in mind - the larger the pattern, the larger the move, **the longer it takes to play out.** This isn't going to happen overnight. Timeframe to complete the move is **3-6 months** \- and we could form lots of smaller patterns in between.

Every time we cross one of those resistances, it should become a support. Also note that upon reaching them, it's likely we consolidate for a few days. Overall - a super clean setup, and a play I've been eyeing since March. 

Lastly, keep in mind - for a setup of this magnitude, you want the **weekly close** for confirmation.

But - what makes this really interesting is the **10 year 1 week chart.**

[$GC 10 Year 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/ejdwc9xvj3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bdfbd8e014548cda17aaf6e754e28cd9abf651f)

Here, we have an absolutely massive cup and handle dating back to 2011. In this context - the addition of this data mainly means we can look for a much higher price target on the wedge breakout. 

As a result - I'm targeting $GC **2250 - 2500** within the next **year.** Remember what I said about timeframes. This could take quite a while. For this setup to trigger - I'm looking for the **monthly close** above that first breakout point.

And... that's it. Remember, technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. Fake outs can and do happen. That's why we identify **key levels** to tell where we are within a setup. Take it step by step.

***TL;DR -*** 

$GC above 1853 weekly close targets **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3**

$GC above 1853 monthly close targets **2250, 2500**

I'm planning to continue doing weekly relative rotation analysis of the market, but wanted to create this mid week post to take a quick look at UWMC. Please let me know if another flair is more appropriate.

I'm not going to get into the financials, since plenty of solid DD has been done on that already. However, I did mention in my last post (analyzing the market sectors) that I would look into positions related to the real estate sector (XLRE).

My thought process here it to take a look at the short term momentum for this stock due to the recent positive earnings, great financials, positive future outlook, and upcoming June Ex-Div date.

Lets jump into it and make it quick...

Since there is a lot of talk regarding Russell inclusion, here is the RRG of UWMC again UWM:

**My Thoughts:**

Personally, the company has strong fundamentals. So, in combination with the momentum, I think its a decent ""buy"" (this is not professional financial advice).

I'm playing this 3 ways:

6/18 short put x 2 @ $7

7/16 long call x 5 @ $6

1100 shares @ $8.06

Edit 1: Silly me, I forgot to mention that a share buyback plan was approved which also contributes to the positive momentum.

What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either.

1762,,2021-05-19 20:14:45,t3_ngftx1,,wallstreetbets,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",ngftx1,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Mr. Cramer..."

Big tech's earnings absolutely destroyed estimates but sell side thinks it's due to lock down and people will rely on tech less once things open up. It's a consistent pattern that all the gains made after earning erode overnight or in a few trading session as if the good earning did not happen.

1765,,2021-05-19 20:51:00,t3_nggpql,,wallstreetbets,"I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

1767,,2021-05-19 21:25:26,t3_nghmhm,,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",nghmhm,$NUE is strong as steel. Buy the dips.

Petco earnings is tomorrow pre-market. But this also might be a potential candidate for a short squeeze.

Short sellers are gearing up for a bad quarter. For the last three days, the short float increased from 4 point-something Monday, 6.05 yesterday, and today it's at 8.75.

In addition, short interest is up to 35.2%

To top it off, there are hardly any shares available to short, though borrowing rate remains at only 1%. For the last five days there were no more than 100k shares left to short.

The average price target is $28, but if earnings goes better than expected, this could be the catalyst for something significantly bigger. Listen to your pets' beckoning calls, and keep this on your watch list!

We‚Äôve had a run up of 55% from 5/6-5/17 to $14.38 high on 5/17.  Slight gain of 0.6% on 5/18 (similar to the slight drop on 3/19 with freaky similar volume changes) and then the massive sell off decline on 5/19 of (9.9%) is eerily similar to the (10.3%) drop on 3/22.......

Potential to give up all of the gains since 5/6 by this Friday and puts are ridiculously cheap in the $10 below range for 5/21 and 5/28.  If AMC goes on a similar slide to the March slide, there will be massive returns on these ridiculously cheap put options (9.9% decline today and the sub $10 puts barely moved in price on both the 5/21 and 5/28 expiration dates.

Cheap way to place a bet if the squeeze doesn‚Äôt materialize that could be a >10x return based on how cheap the <$10 puts are for 5/21 and 5/28 put options.

If you are holding stock, max gains you are getting for $20 is ~2x but this could be the real money maker with puts sub $10 priced at $0.01-$0.05 that could go to $0.5+ if the stock slides similar to the March slide.

1779,,2021-05-20 05:24:49,t3_ngrqqf,,wallstreetbets,"Some context: Cell carriers in the US have decided to stop the function of shared short codes (5-6 digit phone numbers) June 1. Shared short codes were the preferred means of SMS and MMS communication for B2C traffic. Short codes were free to lease in many cases, text messages were cheap, thousands of businesses could send from the same number, and throughput was incredibly high (lots of messages could be sent very fast).

The new policy enforced by the CTIA (The private club all major cell phone carriers are in) is that shared short codes are to be discontinued and replaced by dedicated short codes and A2P 10dlc (approved B2C traffic on 10-digit phone numbers). This means that every business/organization that wants to send texts must either apply for a dedicated short code or apply for a 10DLC. 

Dedicated short codes are the preferred choice for large corporations. They can handle large throughput and look good for the brand. However, they only cater to large corporations because they are thousands of dollars/year to lease. Turn around time for application is 4-6 weeks. Barrier to entry is high.

10DLC is the preferred choice for the smaller businesses since it's less expensive. But, it is still far more expensive than the shared short codes businesses are used to, requires application, and costs $50/mo in carrier and registration fees alone. Turn around time for application is less than a week. On top of fees, 10dlc isn't even fully ready. The Campaign Registry, the organization responsible for rolling out ""the new messaging standard"" for the CTIA, is still developing their API.

Enter Toll-free messaging. TF has 0 barrier to entry and can be issued to a business with SMS and MMS capabilities in seconds. It's the easiest and now the most cost-effective way to send commercial messages.

Conveniently, every major carrier announced this month (for the first time) that they will start collecting a $0.0025/message fee for every sms sent. They're ready for and expecting businesses to move to this method.

Who is Zipwhip: Zipwhip was given full reign over all TF traffic. Anyone in the US  that wants to send messages on TF codes uses Zipwhip in one way or another. They are a massive reseller that everyone is required to go through.

It was recently announced the Twilio plans on acquiring Zipwhip for $850M. Twilio is the leader is programmable messaging hands down. 

Honestly, there should be antitrust issues that arise and block the acquisition. If it goes through, Twilio owns the new world of business sms. Good chance regulators won't notice any issue. They'll miss the fact that businesses will be pressured into TF over their preferred solutions (dedicated short codes and A2P 10DLC) since it's unnecessarily complicated and expensive. TF is ready now and cheap.

TL;DR if Twilio successfully acquires Zipwhip, every small to medium sized business that wants to send texts will have to go through them. Every single one of them in the US.",ngrqqf,$TWLO stands to be the primary source for commercial text messaging

1782,,2021-05-20 08:25:07,t3_ngulnq,,wallstreetbets,"So just how big is **today's news about the initial success of the Sofusa technology**?

1st, this is a technology that aims at lymphatic delivery. 

**What does this mean?** Well, when trying to fight a disease, it's difficult to target the lymphatic system. Because of how it works and the fact that it is spread throughout our body. 

So there are MANY, MANY drugs out there that treat several conditions through the lymphatic system. But, because of what we just explained, those drugs sometimes don't work. They are not properly ""delivered"". They don't get to where they need to get to make the necessary interaction and solve the problem.

**Sorrento has developed a technology that can deliver drugs to where they actually need to go** in the lymphatic system. So this is definitely breakthrough technology. Other companies are aiming to find similar solutions. But we are definitely talking about very advanced bio-tech.

In this case, we have a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. This is a condition that worsens with time. It's very painful and limits the patient's movement. It's not very common, so we are talking about 1.5 million people in the USA and about 30 million worldwide. 

But remember, **the technology Sorrento is developing  will be able to deliver drugs treating many other diseases** related to the lymphatic system. So the market for Sofusa is very, very large.

The press release tells us Sofusa was tested on ""First Enbrel-Non-Responding"" patients. 

**What does this mean?** Patients who need the drug Enbrel and, even though they have not been taking the drug for long (it's a ""first"" for them) they are not responding to it. It isn't helping them. 

Now, Sofusa comes into play. It's job is to deliver Enbrel to the patient effectively. To ""take"" Enbrel to where it needs to go in the lymphatic system.. 

The 1st obvious advantage is that the drug wasn't helping and now helps. But there are other important advantages.

Since the drug is being carried to its targeted ""destination"" the dosage needed, diminishes. Because less is ""lost along the way"". This is important because many diseases related to the lymphatic system, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are chronic, lifelong conditions. Being able to administer less drugs really helps the patient. Now you have a drug that actually works, more potently, which reduces its dosage. All this thanks to Sorrento.

The press release points out an important factor: This is a trial on ONE type of drug/treatment. Other such trials testing the effectiveness of Sofusa are already taking place. Again, this is proof of the potentially huge market for this delivery system.

Just to get an idea, the release mentions anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. These are a type of drugs that inhibit the activity of certain proteins (they inhibit PD1 and CTLA4, which are types of proteins. By stopping their activity, they help in stopping the growth of cancer tumors). There are several drugs that fall under these categories and treat a wide variety of cancers. **Sofusa can potentially play a vital role in all these treatments**. 

This is like several companies developing apps while Sorrento is developing a new smartphone technology. Each app has its rightful use and market. But once the new smartphone is up and working, all apps will need it. So this technology has huge revenue implications. T**he fact we are hearing good news about it is HUGE**.

As for the results themselves: **The DAS28 test measures rheumatoid activity in 28 joints** in the patient's body. The joints might be swollen or tender (hurting).

This patient had a DAS28 score of 4.6, with 18 out of 28 joints compromised.  That is considered  moderate to high disease activity.  There are 4 levels of DAS 28 scores going from remission (the best) to high (the worst). So this patient was not in the worst shape going in, but pretty bad.

Using Sofusa to deliver the Enbrel drug, in just 4 weeks (this is a very short time for this type of disease!!) the results went from 4.6 to 3.0. The total amount of compromised joints, from 18 to 11. **That is a dramatic change**. The patient went from being somewhere between level 3 and 4, to being in the lower level 2, called ""low disease activity"", which indicates it's moving towards remission (the lowest level). For someone suffering from this condition, it's a real life changer. For the company selling Enbrel, it's a real market changer. And if it can equally help people with tumors, **Sofusa becomes a major therapeutic factor.** 

I hope investors understand this. **It's another major development in an already extremely promising pipeline** which is currently badly undervalued. If the price doesn't spike today by 10-15%, as it should, just from this news, it would be disappointing. 

But if you are long, today's price change isn't what matters the most. It‚Äôs the understanding that Sorrento / SRNE has ANOTHER ace in its hand!",ngulnq,How Big is SRNE news release about Sofusa success?

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC and its +23% run in the past week. A stock with a massive dividend. A stock trading with a very low P/E of and income growth of 4,200%.

So why is this stock still a buy and hold for me right now?

The CEO is positioning them to increase shareholder value, but also position the company to weather any reduction in the refi market. (65% of the business)

There are major catalysts that have been driving the increase in price that goes beyond the attention gained on WSB.

* Announced **NET earnings of $860M in the first quarter,** with huge margins.
* Reaffirmed a continued dividend, the next ex-dividend date is **6/9/2021**.
* Announced a **$300M stock buyback, representing as much as 40% of the free float** at the current prices.
* Russell index inclusion was missed last quarter due to confusion about their PREVIOUS status as a SPAC. It is expected that they will be reconsidered for Russell Index inclusions in the yearly reconstitution. While not the biggest catalyst, this is a sign of reputation and long-term stability for the stock. **The prelim list publishes 6/4/2021.**
* Creation of a jumbo mortgage product. The average loan origination in the market is \~410,000, indicating that the non-conforming section of the mortgage market is *exploding.* This is a very profitable sector of loan origination.

Other fundamentals driving a buy recommendation:

* Small float. 90M float, of which only about 60M is freely trading.
* This stock is not persistently pressured down quite as hard as others due to low share availability, but it appears based on the last two weeks it's trading the small waves of this stock to try to push it down under dangerous strike prices. A wave of positive sentiment could strangle this position in the stock. I don't have a Bloomberg terminal, but based on the evidence over the last several days, the indication is the 13.1% SI has grown.
* Exceptional open option interest for **tomorrow 5/21/2021.** The options expiring tomorrow have been documented elsewhere so I won't belabor them, but the open interest at the $9, and $10 strike represent almost 10% of the free float.
* Not a new startup, **they have been in this business since 1986**, making them almost as old as a fossil like me. They clearly survived the 2008 storm. This company isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

The cherry:

* **STILL forecasting growth in Q2**, whereas many of its competitors are not.

This post is NOT financial advice, but as someone who has ridden the waves of this stock since it was about $9, I see this position turning positive and the outlook through July for this position has high sentiment. Even if the mortgage market slows down as expected, I will hold these shares for years to come for the dividends and general stability of the organization.

My position 8000 shares @ 7.65 and 45x 6/18 8c. You can go stalk the fuck out of me if you want to see that I've been talking about this stock for some time and been saying the same thing about the strength and targets of their position since March. I am also the guy that tells you when you unintentionally reveal personal info on your yolo screenshots!

TLDR: UWMC should garner close attention for value investors looking for undervalued positions.

1793,,2021-05-20 13:28:43,t3_nh08j4,,wallstreetbets,"**Investment Thesis**

Overall, what makes MDXG a good buying opportunity right now is a combination of two factors.

* Number one is management‚Äôs miscommunication with the market. The market currently believes that wound care is the core business of MDXG, is not entirely aware of the potential of its biopharma pipeline and more specifically its Amniofix drug, and has priced the company based on this.¬†
* Number two is the huge potential of the Amniofix treatment and its ability to become the next blockbuster in the healthcare space after the conclusion of its phase 3 trial.

**Idea Summary**

MiMedx Group *(MDXG)* is a leading BioPharma and wound care business whose value has been drastically misunderstood by the market. Through drivers such as miscommunication from management about the company‚Äôs valued proposition as well as the lack of institutional investor coverage, the market currently believes that the majority of the company‚Äôs value sits in its low growth wound care business. In reality, its major competitive advantage is within its osteoarthritis drug Amniofix which has the potential to become the next blockbuster after it clears phase III clinical trials. A sum of the parts valuation was used to determine a minimum implied upside of at least 300%. Risks are discussed at the end.

**Business Overview**

MiMedx Group is a leading biopharma and advanced wound care business utilizing human placental tissues to develop products used in the healthcare sector. It processes placental tissues using its patented processes to produce allografts, which are tissues transplanted from one person to another for wound care and regeneration. These allografts are effective in healing difficult wounds because of the ability of the allograft cells to quickly associate with the cells of the patient, thereby taking part in the healing process, easing the ability of the body to close the wound, and speeding up the body‚Äôs regeneration process.

MDXG‚Äôs product offerings can be split into two business segments: wound care and biopharma (surgical solutions). Its flagship product Epifix and additional product Epicord fall under its wound care umbrella, and its flagship product Amniofix as well as additional products Amniocord, Amniofill, and Epiburn fall under its biopharma umbrella. The wound care products service the broad wound care industry, targeting specifically chronic wounds. The biopharma product line is more specific, with the flagship treatment Amniofix targeting knee osteoarthritis in specific.¬†

MDXG sells through direct sales, sales agents, and distributors in the United States. This past quarter, 95% of its sales were direct to customers such as healthcare professionals and facilities.¬†

**Internal Analysis**

The past 3 years have not been ideal for MDXG. Its revenues began to dip in 2018 around the time of their accounting scandal, the growth went from 40% in 2018, to 11% in 2019, and is currently around -16%. This sent their stock price tumbling from $16 USD to lows of almost $1 USD, though it is currently trading at $9 with new updates on their biopharma pipeline.

Their gross margin has stayed very high, around 80% while their EBITDA margins have dropped over the years. Though it wasn‚Äôt explicitly disclosed, a large part of this drop in EBITDA margins has been attributed to a temporary increase in legal fees due to the litigation MDXG has faced this past year. Its decreased volume may have also suppressed margins as the number of wound care treatments in hospitals significantly dropped during COVID-19.¬†

The company‚Äôs cash balance is sitting at a very high level of 84 mm. This is in large part due to its recent capital raise, which happened to be strongly criticized by one of MDXG‚Äôs activist investors, Prescience Point Capital (discussed in detail later).

**External Analysis**

*Wound Care Market*

The global wound care market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% from 2021 to 2028. This has been driven by the aging population and rising rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Wound care products are increasingly being used to prevent and surgical site infections.¬†

Though the overall market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% the specific advanced product segment which includes products such as those of MDXG‚Äôs which target chronic and non-healing wounds, is projected to grow much faster than 4.1%.¬†

The wound care market is relatively fragmented, with large players such as Integra LifeSciences, 3M, Johnson & Johnson, and Medtronic competing to gain the most market share. MDXG‚Äôs direct competition for its allograft advanced wound care treatments include Organogenesis, Axogen, Mediwound, and Vericel.¬†

Organogenesis is currently in the lead in this niche market, and while MDXG reported an 11% YoY decline in sales in 2020 (which has already been factored into the current price), Organogenesis reported a 30% increase. This is evident when comparing the stock performance of both companies over the past year (figure 1)

*Osteoarthritis Therapy Market*

91 million U.S. adults have arthritis, 20M have knee OA, and \~32 million per year are currently treated for plantar fasciitis, which is specifically targeted by MDXG‚Äôs Amniofix drug. There are very few FDA approved treatments for knee OA and plantar fasciitis, and those that exist have low efficacy and many drawbacks. Amniofix is currently the only treatment of its nature in phase 3 clinical trials that have posted very positive results in both company and independent trials, has been used off-label by >100K patients with zero severe adverse effects, and consistently demonstrates a significant reduction in pain as reported by patients. In addition, Amniofix has an RMAT (regenerative medicine advanced therapy) designation granted by the FDA which allows for MDXG to benefit from an expedited approval process from the FDA.

*Management Miscommunication*

The current market opinion of MDXG has been blurred by the miscommunication from company management whose goals do not align with maximizing shareholder value. This is largely due to the fact that EW healthcare, a private equity firm, has 33% representation on the board as a result of its 17% stake. From a corporate finance perspective, a private equity firm‚Äôs interests do not generally tend to align with those of public shareholders. Their influence has been exacerbated by the fact that there are no large institutional holdings in MDXG as of yet other than Prescience Point, and there has been minimal coverage on the stock leading to the market‚Äôs opinion on the company being heavily skewed by management communications.¬†

MDXG‚Äôs current growth strategy is focused on roll-ups in the wound care space. This is very characteristic of a private equity playbook, and goes alongside EW‚Äôs historical acquisitions. As was mentioned in the external analysis, the wound care space is growing at a slow rate of \~4.1%, however MDXG has lost significant market share to Organogenesis. Management has failed to realize that the current value driver of the business is within its biopharma line and not its wound care line, yet has continually communicated to shareholders that it believes it is in fact wound care and it is going to continue investing in growing within the industry.

Prescience Point Capital, an activist investor group which has advocated for change in MDXG's communication strategy, has supported the fact that MDXG‚Äôs communications have been focused on the wrong industry. At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, the potential for the drug Amniofix was drastically undersold and much time was spent convincing investors that the core business is in wound care. The 3.6% decline in shares two days after the conference illustrates how effective this strategy was.¬†

There has been strong opposition from MDXG‚Äôs board of directors to Prescience Point‚Äôs activist efforts. In a shareholder letter in early May, prior to their annual meeting, the company communicated that they believe the wound care and regenerative medicine direction being followed now is ideal. They stated that the activist investor does not understand pharmaceutical company disclosure and were advocating for speculative actions themselves though Prescience‚Äôs report discusses the opposite, with them outlining how EW‚Äôs influence on the board of directors is shifting the company‚Äôs focus away from maximizing shareholder value.

*Amniofix*

As mentioned in the external analysis, there is currently no other treatment, either in development or on the market, as effective as Amniofix in treating knee OA and also just as safe. Most recently, at its Q1 earnings call, MDXG CEO shared positive results from the phase IIb prospective trial of the treatment. There was a statistically significant reduction in VAS (visual analog score) for pain and an improvement in the foot function index score. There were also no serious adverse events during this clinical trial. Amniofix is currently in phase III trials, and MDXG believes they are on target to meet all criteria needed to find a biologics license application (BLA) so that the treatment can be introduced to the general public. MDXG is aiming to file their BLA in the first half of 2022, meaning that within a year this blockbuster treatment could be on the market, and given the feedback so far from clinical trials as well as the RMAT designation, it is highly likely.

A Prescience Point market capture analysis estimated that the treatment would bring in $4,050 million of annual sales. This is \~8 times higher than the current sales brought in through wound care. One year ago it would have been prudent to not entirely incorporate this into the share price, however today with clinical trials nearing completion and MDXG‚Äôs new RMAT designation, the likelihood of approval is much higher.

**Valuation**

From a valuation point of view, a quick sum of the parts analysis is the most ideal given the two different business lines of MDXG. A more in-depth DCF can be created once more cost information is provided from MDXG after the conclusion of clinical trials.

Shares outstanding of 109.8 mm, total debt of 51.8 mm, and total cash of 84.7mm were used to convert from enterprise value to equity value. The current implied upside was calculated using the current price of $9.46.

*Wound Care Valuation*

MDXG‚Äôs FY 2021 sales guidance assumed $255 mm to $270 mm in revenue from the wound care segment. Different points in this revenue ranged were used for the low, base, and high cases of the valuation. An EV/Revenue multiple was used to calculate implied enterprise value. The comparables analysis shown in figure 2 illustrated the median multiples derived from the analysis done using the aforementioned list of MDXG‚Äôs competitors. A median multiple of 5.3x was used. The median was used and not marked down because the gross margin and UFCF yield of MDXG is in-line with all competitors. Though the EBIDTA multiple was lower, the similar yield and gross margins indicate that company performance is relatively the same. In addition, litigation expenses factored into the lower EBIDTA multiples and thus it is not indicative of recurring performance.

Based on the revenue multiples, implied share values for the wound care segment range between $12.0 and $12.8.

**Biopharma Valuation**

Prescience Point estimated annual revenues from Amniofix through using the market capture method. The total market size (annual knee OA injections) was estimated, and a capture percentage was applied to determine the annual number of patients receiving the Amniofix injection. Prescience assumed 1.5 injections per year but to be more conservative in this valuation 1 was used. Price per injection and FDA approval probability varied by the cases and were used to adjust the EV/Rev multiple downwards. Overall, an implied share value range between $25.4 and $57.1 was calculated for this segment.

**Biopharma Equity Value**

Overall, the total implied share price ranges between $37.43 to $69.81. As more information regarding Amniofix comes out including the price of manufacturing, different multiples can be used to fine-tune the analysis.

https://preview.redd.it/a8035yfo1a071.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=12e0f9a041e326b505bfda25304261367c651406

**Risks**

1. Given the high influence EW healthcare has on the board of directors, there is potential for more value to describe acquisitions such as that of stability biologics, which was bought for 10 million and sold for 3.5 million 3 years later. If such a trend continues, the value of MDXG‚Äôs wound care business can dramatically decrease, which will hurt the share pierce
2. The FDA approval of Amniofix is a large driver of the valuation calculated. There is a large risk that the FDA will not approve the treatment, however, with the RMAT designation in place and positive results from the first two phases of clinical trials, the odds are strongly in the favour of the approval at the current point in time.

If you aren't familiar with the efficient frontier, what it tries to find is the *mean-variance portfolio.* This type of model deals with portfolio management / optimization. In terms of the efficient frontier you are trying to find the best portfolio allocation weights that give you the best risk adjusted returns. 

**In simple words:** you give it stocks and it tells you the best percentage holdings

I recently built an app on some python code that does this sort of optimization. There is no programming required to use the app. When running the app it will give two portfolios, minimum variance, and maximized sharpe (same as mean-variance, mean-markowitz). Minimum variance will tell you the least riskiest holding strategy (green), and max sharpe will give you the best reward-for-risk holding (red). I call that portfolio *the-juice-is-worth-the-squeeze.* Here is a sample output.

I used around 100,000 simulations, and 10Y of adjusted close data. 

The reason why I bring this up is because it does two things. The first is that it promotes portfolio diversification, which I know is pretty uncommon here. Also it finds the most aggressive returns in terms of minimizing risk. If you have high returns and wonder why you returns are so much higher than standard investment funds its probably because you are here

#Topics of discussion:

* Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks

* WDC Fundamentals

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

&#x200B;

Some of the reasons why I'm bullish on Gold include: the wealth effect, intrinsic vs extrinsic value, income effect (marginal propensity to consume), inflation (rising price levels), weakening of the dollar, uncertainty in the markets, luxury goods, the effect of government spending and stimulus, scarcity of natural resources, supply and demand, increasing costs to produce (oil, labor, machinery etc...).

Unsprung mass is the mass beneath the suspension. That is the part of the vehicle that is supposed to track the road. When you have bumps the unsprung mass acts directly on that. So the more unsprung mass the harder the bumps are hit and more work is needed (i.e. the wheels absorb more energy from the bump so you have to work harder to continue moving). The unsprung mass also reduces the damping ability of the tires as it does not have the suspension to help isolate the weight. So your tires will deform more on hitting a bump. Also, when hitting a bump, the more unsprung mass the more likely the wheel will actually bump up and leave the road temporarily as the suspension has to work harder to keep it down (since there is more force involved in hitting every bump).

Here are some sources that discuss unsprung mass to help you out:

They chose to get their profits on volume instead of margin. what does the average tesla sell for? around $54k? how sustainable do you think  their current margins would be?  can they keep growing at the same rate with the same margins YoY selling $50k cars?

then you look at the other facts:

1. tesla has almost gone unopposed for US EVs (unless you consider things like the leaf/mini-E/500 etc actual competition). Only true competition  was the e-tron.

2. tesla is still just getting the new EV and new Tesla buyers. if you could spend 40k+ on an EV, you had literally 1 option until this year.

3. gross margins are cute but unless they have the growth to cover operating costs, it would essentially mean nothing.

4. all the new players in the game. Mach E, R1t/R1s, lightning, e-trons, air, fisker?, ride?, hummer, EQS/EQC.

Serious advice only please.

&#x200B;

The sharesave scheme I'm in is being closed soon and I have the option of cashing it in or paying in for a further 6 months then cashing in.  
  
I pay in to 3 separate 3 year schemes with varying amounts in them. These can each be cashed in soon or in 6 months separately, I can make an individual choice for each of them, they don't have to be all soon or all 6 months.  
  
The shares we buy are Walmart shares.  
  
On the one hand if I cash in now I'll get fewer shares but then if I cash in later I'll have more shares which would compensate for a small drop in the price if it does fall.

Should I cash in now or later?",,

You make your small win betting side the side the ball falls to the most, and cover the next hot six with your medium bet. For American, you place between the zeros. Luck does factor in, but if you go to the casino, you go to lose money anyways. At the very least, you get to lengthen the loss. I walked in expecting to lose the $300 I walked in with.

First thing I notice is that periods of high variance returns are not sustained and they look possibly isolated, although there minor spikes before each big one.

https://preview.redd.it/ln6677wul1071.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c72c82557c3045a9575d857189931a84a693c24

On the other hand it looks like medium variance and low variance are in a constant switch off. We can see the almost perfect inversion between low variance probabilities and medium.

https://preview.redd.it/eqnl6ctzl1071.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f75444f4a5a854e7d842bb7f212c378c442f928

Most of those high variance returns come from changes from low to high variance. 

https://preview.redd.it/awjv82x4m1071.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=840a93a87d1745f84d79964cc296b8b282ff4153

This shows that high variance returns are more like *surprises* in the market because they come from low variance returns, its not a gradual buildup.  

**QQQ results**

QQQ‚Äôs results are very similar to SPY‚Äôs results. 

https://preview.redd.it/bqavsxmam1071.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad8be59558f24274d2ac689fa83e8c7a629de55

It seems like there are not *precursor* spikes in high variance returns, and the occur in isolation.  In this case it does seem like there is a sustained period of high variance returns in the early 2000s.  

https://preview.redd.it/gp4sc5yem1071.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=73c238b2a8657a2ada87e458ebc27140654a352f

The same cyclical inverse pattern occurs within the low and medium level regimes.

https://preview.redd.it/qqkq714km1071.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=899816666e35168b5e1756ee58dba86013739f5c

And consistent with SPY it seems like high variance regime spikes come from low variance to high variance.

https://preview.redd.it/cb5o3v2om1071.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89f554112e2b8dd2d79904a6aa6249b3326a31a

**Conclusions / Future areas to investigate**

¬∑ In CBOE VIX data is was common for large spikes in high variance to come from medium variance regimes, that does not seem to be the case for SPY or QQQ most of the high variance spikes come from changes from low variance to high variance

¬∑ Both QQQ and SPY exhibited what look like to be an inverse relationship between low and medium variance regimes. Confirming results and possibly making indicators could be comparing covariances and trends between the time series and then if a there is a *shift* that is probably a *break* in the relationship which probably leads to a time of high variance

¬∑ QQQ did exhibit high variance regime for a longer sustained time and that may be because of its growth-orientation.

 I hope to turn the codebase into a python-only repo so I can analyze the time series in a notebook a publish more of my findings.

[$GC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/dudwlorvi3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb931a041ddf4f5b79d58c008d4badcb8b91b7c2)

First - let's take a look at the **1 year 1 day** chart. Here - we are breaking what appears to just be a broadening descending wedge (a massive one). The breakout point was **1853 -** and it needs to hold **1848** to stay intact. 

You can see we already got some follow through here. Now, price targets/resistances are **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3.** 

Keep in mind - the larger the pattern, the larger the move, **the longer it takes to play out.** This isn't going to happen overnight. Timeframe to complete the move is **3-6 months** \- and we could form lots of smaller patterns in between.

Every time we cross one of those resistances, it should become a support. Also note that upon reaching them, it's likely we consolidate for a few days. Overall - a super clean setup, and a play I've been eyeing since March. 

Lastly, keep in mind - for a setup of this magnitude, you want the **weekly close** for confirmation.

But - what makes this really interesting is the **10 year 1 week chart.**

[$GC 10 Year 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/ejdwc9xvj3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bdfbd8e014548cda17aaf6e754e28cd9abf651f)

Here, we have an absolutely massive cup and handle dating back to 2011. In this context - the addition of this data mainly means we can look for a much higher price target on the wedge breakout. 

As a result - I'm targeting $GC **2250 - 2500** within the next **year.** Remember what I said about timeframes. This could take quite a while. For this setup to trigger - I'm looking for the **monthly close** above that first breakout point.

And... that's it. Remember, technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. Fake outs can and do happen. That's why we identify **key levels** to tell where we are within a setup. Take it step by step.

***TL;DR -*** 

$GC above 1853 weekly close targets **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3**

$GC above 1853 monthly close targets **2250, 2500**

I'm planning to continue doing weekly relative rotation analysis of the market, but wanted to create this mid week post to take a quick look at UWMC. Please let me know if another flair is more appropriate.

I'm not going to get into the financials, since plenty of solid DD has been done on that already. However, I did mention in my last post (analyzing the market sectors) that I would look into positions related to the real estate sector (XLRE).

My thought process here it to take a look at the short term momentum for this stock due to the recent positive earnings, great financials, positive future outlook, and upcoming June Ex-Div date.

Lets jump into it and make it quick...

Since there is a lot of talk regarding Russell inclusion, here is the RRG of UWMC again UWM:

**My Thoughts:**

Personally, the company has strong fundamentals. So, in combination with the momentum, I think its a decent ""buy"" (this is not professional financial advice).

I'm playing this 3 ways:

6/18 short put x 2 @ $7

7/16 long call x 5 @ $6

1100 shares @ $8.06

Edit 1: Silly me, I forgot to mention that a share buyback plan was approved which also contributes to the positive momentum.

The longshots in her portfolio which have had massive success are often successful because her fund's investment has massively increased their market cap.  She has also tied herself so tightly to Tesla that she can never hop off that ride. She's tied to the autopilot whether it goes to the moon or into a tree. I'm not denying that she has had good results during this bull market, but I think a fund that goes the other direction will do very well over the next 5 years.

What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either. 

Here is some better and more thought out DD:

2377,,2021-05-19 20:14:45,t3_ngftx1,,wallstreetbets,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",ngftx1,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Mr. Cramer..."

Big tech's earnings absolutely destroyed estimates but sell side thinks it's due to lock down and people will rely on tech less once things open up. It's a consistent pattern that all the gains made after earning erode overnight or in a few trading session as if the good earning did not happen.

2380,,2021-05-19 20:51:00,t3_nggpql,,wallstreetbets,"I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

2382,,2021-05-19 21:25:26,t3_nghmhm,,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",nghmhm,$NUE is strong as steel. Buy the dips.

Petco earnings is tomorrow pre-market. But this also might be a potential candidate for a short squeeze.

Short sellers are gearing up for a bad quarter. For the last three days, the short float increased from 4 point-something Monday, 6.05 yesterday, and today it's at 8.75.

In addition, short interest is up to 35.2%

To top it off, there are hardly any shares available to short, though borrowing rate remains at only 1%. For the last five days there were no more than 100k shares left to short.

The average price target is $28, but if earnings goes better than expected, this could be the catalyst for something significantly bigger. Listen to your pets' beckoning calls, and keep this on your watch list!

2) Lordstown Week (June 21-25): Plant open house for tours, test drives, etc., and above all else, transparency.  This should alone should put the final nail in the shorts coffin.

2394,,2021-05-20 05:24:49,t3_ngrqqf,,wallstreetbets,"Some context: Cell carriers in the US have decided to stop the function of shared short codes (5-6 digit phone numbers) June 1. Shared short codes were the preferred means of SMS and MMS communication for B2C traffic. Short codes were free to lease in many cases, text messages were cheap, thousands of businesses could send from the same number, and throughput was incredibly high (lots of messages could be sent very fast).

The new policy enforced by the CTIA (The private club all major cell phone carriers are in) is that shared short codes are to be discontinued and replaced by dedicated short codes and A2P 10dlc (approved B2C traffic on 10-digit phone numbers). This means that every business/organization that wants to send texts must either apply for a dedicated short code or apply for a 10DLC. 

Dedicated short codes are the preferred choice for large corporations. They can handle large throughput and look good for the brand. However, they only cater to large corporations because they are thousands of dollars/year to lease. Turn around time for application is 4-6 weeks. Barrier to entry is high.

10DLC is the preferred choice for the smaller businesses since it's less expensive. But, it is still far more expensive than the shared short codes businesses are used to, requires application, and costs $50/mo in carrier and registration fees alone. Turn around time for application is less than a week. On top of fees, 10dlc isn't even fully ready. The Campaign Registry, the organization responsible for rolling out ""the new messaging standard"" for the CTIA, is still developing their API.

Enter Toll-free messaging. TF has 0 barrier to entry and can be issued to a business with SMS and MMS capabilities in seconds. It's the easiest and now the most cost-effective way to send commercial messages.

Conveniently, every major carrier announced this month (for the first time) that they will start collecting a $0.0025/message fee for every sms sent. They're ready for and expecting businesses to move to this method.

Who is Zipwhip: Zipwhip was given full reign over all TF traffic. Anyone in the US  that wants to send messages on TF codes uses Zipwhip in one way or another. They are a massive reseller that everyone is required to go through.

It was recently announced the Twilio plans on acquiring Zipwhip for $850M. Twilio is the leader is programmable messaging hands down. 

Honestly, there should be antitrust issues that arise and block the acquisition. If it goes through, Twilio owns the new world of business sms. Good chance regulators won't notice any issue. They'll miss the fact that businesses will be pressured into TF over their preferred solutions (dedicated short codes and A2P 10DLC) since it's unnecessarily complicated and expensive. TF is ready now and cheap.

TL;DR if Twilio successfully acquires Zipwhip, every small to medium sized business that wants to send texts will have to go through them. Every single one of them in the US.",ngrqqf,$TWLO stands to be the primary source for commercial text messaging

2397,,2021-05-20 08:25:07,t3_ngulnq,,wallstreetbets,"So just how big is **today's news about the initial success of the Sofusa technology**?

1st, this is a technology that aims at lymphatic delivery. 

**What does this mean?** Well, when trying to fight a disease, it's difficult to target the lymphatic system. Because of how it works and the fact that it is spread throughout our body. 

So there are MANY, MANY drugs out there that treat several conditions through the lymphatic system. But, because of what we just explained, those drugs sometimes don't work. They are not properly ""delivered"". They don't get to where they need to get to make the necessary interaction and solve the problem.

**Sorrento has developed a technology that can deliver drugs to where they actually need to go** in the lymphatic system. So this is definitely breakthrough technology. Other companies are aiming to find similar solutions. But we are definitely talking about very advanced bio-tech.

In this case, we have a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. This is a condition that worsens with time. It's very painful and limits the patient's movement. It's not very common, so we are talking about 1.5 million people in the USA and about 30 million worldwide. 

But remember, **the technology Sorrento is developing  will be able to deliver drugs treating many other diseases** related to the lymphatic system. So the market for Sofusa is very, very large.

The press release tells us Sofusa was tested on ""First Enbrel-Non-Responding"" patients. 

**What does this mean?** Patients who need the drug Enbrel and, even though they have not been taking the drug for long (it's a ""first"" for them) they are not responding to it. It isn't helping them. 

Now, Sofusa comes into play. It's job is to deliver Enbrel to the patient effectively. To ""take"" Enbrel to where it needs to go in the lymphatic system.. 

The 1st obvious advantage is that the drug wasn't helping and now helps. But there are other important advantages.

Since the drug is being carried to its targeted ""destination"" the dosage needed, diminishes. Because less is ""lost along the way"". This is important because many diseases related to the lymphatic system, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are chronic, lifelong conditions. Being able to administer less drugs really helps the patient. Now you have a drug that actually works, more potently, which reduces its dosage. All this thanks to Sorrento.

The press release points out an important factor: This is a trial on ONE type of drug/treatment. Other such trials testing the effectiveness of Sofusa are already taking place. Again, this is proof of the potentially huge market for this delivery system.

Just to get an idea, the release mentions anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. These are a type of drugs that inhibit the activity of certain proteins (they inhibit PD1 and CTLA4, which are types of proteins. By stopping their activity, they help in stopping the growth of cancer tumors). There are several drugs that fall under these categories and treat a wide variety of cancers. **Sofusa can potentially play a vital role in all these treatments**. 

This is like several companies developing apps while Sorrento is developing a new smartphone technology. Each app has its rightful use and market. But once the new smartphone is up and working, all apps will need it. So this technology has huge revenue implications. T**he fact we are hearing good news about it is HUGE**.

As for the results themselves: **The DAS28 test measures rheumatoid activity in 28 joints** in the patient's body. The joints might be swollen or tender (hurting).

This patient had a DAS28 score of 4.6, with 18 out of 28 joints compromised.  That is considered  moderate to high disease activity.  There are 4 levels of DAS 28 scores going from remission (the best) to high (the worst). So this patient was not in the worst shape going in, but pretty bad.

Using Sofusa to deliver the Enbrel drug, in just 4 weeks (this is a very short time for this type of disease!!) the results went from 4.6 to 3.0. The total amount of compromised joints, from 18 to 11. **That is a dramatic change**. The patient went from being somewhere between level 3 and 4, to being in the lower level 2, called ""low disease activity"", which indicates it's moving towards remission (the lowest level). For someone suffering from this condition, it's a real life changer. For the company selling Enbrel, it's a real market changer. And if it can equally help people with tumors, **Sofusa becomes a major therapeutic factor.** 

I hope investors understand this. **It's another major development in an already extremely promising pipeline** which is currently badly undervalued. If the price doesn't spike today by 10-15%, as it should, just from this news, it would be disappointing. 

But if you are long, today's price change isn't what matters the most. It‚Äôs the understanding that Sorrento / SRNE has ANOTHER ace in its hand!",ngulnq,How Big is SRNE news release about Sofusa success?

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC and its +23% run in the past week. A stock with a massive dividend. A stock trading with a very low P/E of and income growth of 4,200%.

So why is this stock still a buy and hold for me right now?

The CEO is positioning them to increase shareholder value, but also position the company to weather any reduction in the refi market. (65% of the business)

There are major catalysts that have been driving the increase in price that goes beyond the attention gained on WSB.

* Announced **NET earnings of $860M in the first quarter,** with huge margins.
* Reaffirmed a continued dividend, the next ex-dividend date is **6/9/2021**.
* Announced a **$300M stock buyback, representing as much as 40% of the free float** at the current prices.
* Russell index inclusion was missed last quarter due to confusion about their PREVIOUS status as a SPAC. It is expected that they will be reconsidered for Russell Index inclusions in the yearly reconstitution. While not the biggest catalyst, this is a sign of reputation and long-term stability for the stock. **The prelim list publishes 6/4/2021.**
* Creation of a jumbo mortgage product. The average loan origination in the market is \~410,000, indicating that the non-conforming section of the mortgage market is *exploding.* This is a very profitable sector of loan origination.

Other fundamentals driving a buy recommendation:

* Small float. 90M float, of which only about 60M is freely trading.
* This stock is not persistently pressured down quite as hard as others due to low share availability, but it appears based on the last two weeks it's trading the small waves of this stock to try to push it down under dangerous strike prices. A wave of positive sentiment could strangle this position in the stock. I don't have a Bloomberg terminal, but based on the evidence over the last several days, the indication is the 13.1% SI has grown.
* Exceptional open option interest for **tomorrow 5/21/2021.** The options expiring tomorrow have been documented elsewhere so I won't belabor them, but the open interest at the $9, and $10 strike represent almost 10% of the free float.
* Not a new startup, **they have been in this business since 1986**, making them almost as old as a fossil like me. They clearly survived the 2008 storm. This company isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

The cherry:

* **STILL forecasting growth in Q2**, whereas many of its competitors are not.

This post is NOT financial advice, but as someone who has ridden the waves of this stock since it was about $9, I see this position turning positive and the outlook through July for this position has high sentiment. Even if the mortgage market slows down as expected, I will hold these shares for years to come for the dividends and general stability of the organization.

My position 8000 shares @ 7.65 and 45x 6/18 8c. You can go stalk the fuck out of me if you want to see that I've been talking about this stock for some time and been saying the same thing about the strength and targets of their position since March. I am also the guy that tells you when you unintentionally reveal personal info on your yolo screenshots!

TLDR: UWMC should garner close attention for value investors looking for undervalued positions.

2408,,2021-05-20 13:28:43,t3_nh08j4,,wallstreetbets,"**Investment Thesis**

Overall, what makes MDXG a good buying opportunity right now is a combination of two factors.

* Number one is management‚Äôs miscommunication with the market. The market currently believes that wound care is the core business of MDXG, is not entirely aware of the potential of its biopharma pipeline and more specifically its Amniofix drug, and has priced the company based on this.¬†
* Number two is the huge potential of the Amniofix treatment and its ability to become the next blockbuster in the healthcare space after the conclusion of its phase 3 trial.

**Idea Summary**

MiMedx Group *(MDXG)* is a leading BioPharma and wound care business whose value has been drastically misunderstood by the market. Through drivers such as miscommunication from management about the company‚Äôs valued proposition as well as the lack of institutional investor coverage, the market currently believes that the majority of the company‚Äôs value sits in its low growth wound care business. In reality, its major competitive advantage is within its osteoarthritis drug Amniofix which has the potential to become the next blockbuster after it clears phase III clinical trials. A sum of the parts valuation was used to determine a minimum implied upside of at least 300%. Risks are discussed at the end.

**Business Overview**

MiMedx Group is a leading biopharma and advanced wound care business utilizing human placental tissues to develop products used in the healthcare sector. It processes placental tissues using its patented processes to produce allografts, which are tissues transplanted from one person to another for wound care and regeneration. These allografts are effective in healing difficult wounds because of the ability of the allograft cells to quickly associate with the cells of the patient, thereby taking part in the healing process, easing the ability of the body to close the wound, and speeding up the body‚Äôs regeneration process.

MDXG‚Äôs product offerings can be split into two business segments: wound care and biopharma (surgical solutions). Its flagship product Epifix and additional product Epicord fall under its wound care umbrella, and its flagship product Amniofix as well as additional products Amniocord, Amniofill, and Epiburn fall under its biopharma umbrella. The wound care products service the broad wound care industry, targeting specifically chronic wounds. The biopharma product line is more specific, with the flagship treatment Amniofix targeting knee osteoarthritis in specific.¬†

MDXG sells through direct sales, sales agents, and distributors in the United States. This past quarter, 95% of its sales were direct to customers such as healthcare professionals and facilities.¬†

**Internal Analysis**

The past 3 years have not been ideal for MDXG. Its revenues began to dip in 2018 around the time of their accounting scandal, the growth went from 40% in 2018, to 11% in 2019, and is currently around -16%. This sent their stock price tumbling from $16 USD to lows of almost $1 USD, though it is currently trading at $9 with new updates on their biopharma pipeline.

Their gross margin has stayed very high, around 80% while their EBITDA margins have dropped over the years. Though it wasn‚Äôt explicitly disclosed, a large part of this drop in EBITDA margins has been attributed to a temporary increase in legal fees due to the litigation MDXG has faced this past year. Its decreased volume may have also suppressed margins as the number of wound care treatments in hospitals significantly dropped during COVID-19.¬†

The company‚Äôs cash balance is sitting at a very high level of 84 mm. This is in large part due to its recent capital raise, which happened to be strongly criticized by one of MDXG‚Äôs activist investors, Prescience Point Capital (discussed in detail later).

**External Analysis**

*Wound Care Market*

The global wound care market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% from 2021 to 2028. This has been driven by the aging population and rising rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Wound care products are increasingly being used to prevent and surgical site infections.¬†

Though the overall market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% the specific advanced product segment which includes products such as those of MDXG‚Äôs which target chronic and non-healing wounds, is projected to grow much faster than 4.1%.¬†

The wound care market is relatively fragmented, with large players such as Integra LifeSciences, 3M, Johnson & Johnson, and Medtronic competing to gain the most market share. MDXG‚Äôs direct competition for its allograft advanced wound care treatments include Organogenesis, Axogen, Mediwound, and Vericel.¬†

Organogenesis is currently in the lead in this niche market, and while MDXG reported an 11% YoY decline in sales in 2020 (which has already been factored into the current price), Organogenesis reported a 30% increase. This is evident when comparing the stock performance of both companies over the past year (figure 1)

*Osteoarthritis Therapy Market*

91 million U.S. adults have arthritis, 20M have knee OA, and \~32 million per year are currently treated for plantar fasciitis, which is specifically targeted by MDXG‚Äôs Amniofix drug. There are very few FDA approved treatments for knee OA and plantar fasciitis, and those that exist have low efficacy and many drawbacks. Amniofix is currently the only treatment of its nature in phase 3 clinical trials that have posted very positive results in both company and independent trials, has been used off-label by >100K patients with zero severe adverse effects, and consistently demonstrates a significant reduction in pain as reported by patients. In addition, Amniofix has an RMAT (regenerative medicine advanced therapy) designation granted by the FDA which allows for MDXG to benefit from an expedited approval process from the FDA.

*Management Miscommunication*

The current market opinion of MDXG has been blurred by the miscommunication from company management whose goals do not align with maximizing shareholder value. This is largely due to the fact that EW healthcare, a private equity firm, has 33% representation on the board as a result of its 17% stake. From a corporate finance perspective, a private equity firm‚Äôs interests do not generally tend to align with those of public shareholders. Their influence has been exacerbated by the fact that there are no large institutional holdings in MDXG as of yet other than Prescience Point, and there has been minimal coverage on the stock leading to the market‚Äôs opinion on the company being heavily skewed by management communications.¬†

MDXG‚Äôs current growth strategy is focused on roll-ups in the wound care space. This is very characteristic of a private equity playbook, and goes alongside EW‚Äôs historical acquisitions. As was mentioned in the external analysis, the wound care space is growing at a slow rate of \~4.1%, however MDXG has lost significant market share to Organogenesis. Management has failed to realize that the current value driver of the business is within its biopharma line and not its wound care line, yet has continually communicated to shareholders that it believes it is in fact wound care and it is going to continue investing in growing within the industry.

Prescience Point Capital, an activist investor group which has advocated for change in MDXG's communication strategy, has supported the fact that MDXG‚Äôs communications have been focused on the wrong industry. At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, the potential for the drug Amniofix was drastically undersold and much time was spent convincing investors that the core business is in wound care. The 3.6% decline in shares two days after the conference illustrates how effective this strategy was.¬†

There has been strong opposition from MDXG‚Äôs board of directors to Prescience Point‚Äôs activist efforts. In a shareholder letter in early May, prior to their annual meeting, the company communicated that they believe the wound care and regenerative medicine direction being followed now is ideal. They stated that the activist investor does not understand pharmaceutical company disclosure and were advocating for speculative actions themselves though Prescience‚Äôs report discusses the opposite, with them outlining how EW‚Äôs influence on the board of directors is shifting the company‚Äôs focus away from maximizing shareholder value.

*Amniofix*

As mentioned in the external analysis, there is currently no other treatment, either in development or on the market, as effective as Amniofix in treating knee OA and also just as safe. Most recently, at its Q1 earnings call, MDXG CEO shared positive results from the phase IIb prospective trial of the treatment. There was a statistically significant reduction in VAS (visual analog score) for pain and an improvement in the foot function index score. There were also no serious adverse events during this clinical trial. Amniofix is currently in phase III trials, and MDXG believes they are on target to meet all criteria needed to find a biologics license application (BLA) so that the treatment can be introduced to the general public. MDXG is aiming to file their BLA in the first half of 2022, meaning that within a year this blockbuster treatment could be on the market, and given the feedback so far from clinical trials as well as the RMAT designation, it is highly likely.

A Prescience Point market capture analysis estimated that the treatment would bring in $4,050 million of annual sales. This is \~8 times higher than the current sales brought in through wound care. One year ago it would have been prudent to not entirely incorporate this into the share price, however today with clinical trials nearing completion and MDXG‚Äôs new RMAT designation, the likelihood of approval is much higher.

**Valuation**

From a valuation point of view, a quick sum of the parts analysis is the most ideal given the two different business lines of MDXG. A more in-depth DCF can be created once more cost information is provided from MDXG after the conclusion of clinical trials.

Shares outstanding of 109.8 mm, total debt of 51.8 mm, and total cash of 84.7mm were used to convert from enterprise value to equity value. The current implied upside was calculated using the current price of $9.46.

*Wound Care Valuation*

MDXG‚Äôs FY 2021 sales guidance assumed $255 mm to $270 mm in revenue from the wound care segment. Different points in this revenue ranged were used for the low, base, and high cases of the valuation. An EV/Revenue multiple was used to calculate implied enterprise value. The comparables analysis shown in figure 2 illustrated the median multiples derived from the analysis done using the aforementioned list of MDXG‚Äôs competitors. A median multiple of 5.3x was used. The median was used and not marked down because the gross margin and UFCF yield of MDXG is in-line with all competitors. Though the EBIDTA multiple was lower, the similar yield and gross margins indicate that company performance is relatively the same. In addition, litigation expenses factored into the lower EBIDTA multiples and thus it is not indicative of recurring performance.

Based on the revenue multiples, implied share values for the wound care segment range between $12.0 and $12.8.

**Wound Care Equity Value**

**Biopharma Valuation**

Prescience Point estimated annual revenues from Amniofix through using the market capture method. The total market size (annual knee OA injections) was estimated, and a capture percentage was applied to determine the annual number of patients receiving the Amniofix injection. Prescience assumed 1.5 injections per year but to be more conservative in this valuation 1 was used. Price per injection and FDA approval probability varied by the cases and were used to adjust the EV/Rev multiple downwards. Overall, an implied share value range between $25.4 and $57.1 was calculated for this segment.

https://preview.redd.it/we0pw4jm1a071.png?width=611&format=png&auto=webp&s=567d19cc5acc59acbe552a2afcf09789c80866ff

**Biopharma Equity Value**

Overall, the total implied share price ranges between $37.43 to $69.81. As more information regarding Amniofix comes out including the price of manufacturing, different multiples can be used to fine-tune the analysis.

https://preview.redd.it/a8035yfo1a071.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=12e0f9a041e326b505bfda25304261367c651406

**Risks**

1. Given the high influence EW healthcare has on the board of directors, there is potential for more value to describe acquisitions such as that of stability biologics, which was bought for 10 million and sold for 3.5 million 3 years later. If such a trend continues, the value of MDXG‚Äôs wound care business can dramatically decrease, which will hurt the share pierce
2. The FDA approval of Amniofix is a large driver of the valuation calculated. There is a large risk that the FDA will not approve the treatment, however, with the RMAT designation in place and positive results from the first two phases of clinical trials, the odds are strongly in the favour of the approval at the current point in time.

If you aren't familiar with the efficient frontier, what it tries to find is the *mean-variance portfolio.* This type of model deals with portfolio management / optimization. In terms of the efficient frontier you are trying to find the best portfolio allocation weights that give you the best risk adjusted returns. 

**In simple words:** you give it stocks and it tells you the best percentage holdings

I recently built an app on some python code that does this sort of optimization. There is no programming required to use the app. When running the app it will give two portfolios, minimum variance, and maximized sharpe (same as mean-variance, mean-markowitz). Minimum variance will tell you the least riskiest holding strategy (green), and max sharpe will give you the best reward-for-risk holding (red). I call that portfolio *the-juice-is-worth-the-squeeze.* Here is a sample output.

I used around 100,000 simulations, and 10Y of adjusted close data. 

The reason why I bring this up is because it does two things. The first is that it promotes portfolio diversification, which I know is pretty uncommon here. Also it finds the most aggressive returns in terms of minimizing risk. If you have high returns and wonder why you returns are so much higher than standard investment funds its probably because you are here

#Topics of discussion:

* Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks

* WDC Fundamentals

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

My name is Nico, I'm a sophomore in college, and I think Gold ($GLD) is going to explode in value.

There are so many reasons as to why,  and I try to cover them in my [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M85FuEX02YE), but even then I think there's more room for discussion.

&#x200B;

Some of the reasons why I'm bullish on Gold include: the wealth effect, intrinsic vs extrinsic value, income effect (marginal propensity to consume), inflation (rising price levels), weakening of the dollar, uncertainty in the markets, luxury goods, the effect of government spending and stimulus, scarcity of natural resources, supply and demand, increasing costs to produce (oil, labor, machinery etc...).

Ten yeats ago they had a gain of 145 k $ now their up to 70 Million in 2020 

The stock price seems hard undervalued at 3.50 $.

Their is an estimated PER of over 100 in 2022 the stock hss now a PER of -50.

They had also a spike few years ago and survived the corona crisis with nearly no losses.

If this company will rise in gains like the last 10 years and the PER will stay the same. This company must be undervalued as hell.

Lithium will be the future (electric vehicles or batteries) and in some combination with some irons it could also be a very sustainable material.

The electric vehicle boom in the USA and europe could also leed to a higher lithium price which in that case Orocobre could even get to have wins in the next year (estimated next 5 quarters (estimation by myself)).

They also have an high developed technologie in use especially to mine in areas that arent very friendly to miners. And im not meaning the bedroom of youre grandmother.

So logically if this company dont even change something they are hardcore underrated by now, if they improve by then self they are underated now aswell but the stock could go even higher and if politics enviorment and electric hypes continue to love lithium, then ill guess this is the new spaceship to the moon.

\*\*\*My average in @ $5.10, currently at $5.52, May 20th, 2021

I am not investing in the company as a get-rich-quick scheme, but plan to hold long term. **Saphyr** technology will continue to improve directly with design improvements, but also indirectly with the data that it continuously collects will create more accurate correlations of DNA with individual predispositions for disease. 

I believe the technology will allow for a more personal approach in the field of medicine, and should not be viewed solely as a research-based company.  

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community. 

* **Large institutional investments have nearly tripled (3X) from 5% to 14%.** 
* **Earnings beat expectations in Q1 2021.**
* **Recent large insider procurement.**
* **New patents, research breakthroughs, Large Lab facility adoption.**

This is why I have a strong conviction for **Bionano Genomics (BNGO)** being a great growth stock to investigate and follow. 

There are some negative indicators fundamentally, but considering Bionano is still in its infancy I am very optimistic in my outlook. The positives tip the scale in my opinion and at the very least, Bianano Genomics (BNGO) should be on your watchlist!

What core inflation is looking at is if prices of goods and services are going up without the effects of energy prices which go up and down so regularly its not accurate to include them.

So basically what could cause core inflation to go up?

Well you said it in your analysis...wages. wages are the core source of inflation in an economic model. If wages go up then everything becomes more expensive. This is taking everything else equal of course. Wages CAN go up without causing inflation if it is paired with increased productivity. 

Think of it like this: how much does it cost to make something? Well you need raw resources, energy, and then manpower or technology. If manpower costs go up they aren't ever going down which means inflation. Of energy prices go up, well they can go back down in a month...its temporary. Raw materials are the same...during supply shocks like we ha e right now prices go up. But then produce trying to capitalize on higher prices increase supply and prices go back down. Simple market dynamics.

Voyager Digital has had their token swap audited and certified by Quantstamp and the strategy should be released very soon to the market.
‚Ä¢ The swap live could signal a ready position to start penetrating the Euorpean market and bringing on their current waitlist in Europe
‚Ä¢ Their partnership with Market Rebellion and Blockdaemon could bring light a strategy in the short term for adding stocks, and enhanced interest rates both on cryptos and stocks. Then expanding into an education platform as well
‚Ä¢ Their recent announcement of partnership with Lottery.com could be an opportunity for them to showcase to the market how they plan on partnering with future companies and banking institutions.
‚Ä¢ Their debit cards, credit cards and margin are features expected to be announced soon. Creating an option for total banking inside of Voyager to earn 9% interest on USDC and holding crypto and fiat as a banking method which could increase monies held and stickiness.
‚Ä¢ Times of volatility should increase Voyager‚Äôs profitability based on past exchange evaluations and given the fact of not just increased orders but more arbitrage opportunities for their routing system.
‚Ä¢ They just announced various new talented board members and leaders
o New CDO ‚Äì ex executive at Uber, Oracle JPMorgan and more
o New CMO- ex CMO of E-TRADE
o New Board Members- CFO of Raymond James, CEO of Gain Retail at StoneX
‚Ä¢ Voyager was approved by the NCIB to repurchase up to 5% of its stock between May 30th 2021 and May 30th 2022.
‚Ä¢ The liquidity of Voyager stock right now is very low with a trade volume close to only 1.2%
‚Ä¢ The short ratio to volume is about 70%
 
So, what would ignite the flame and cause a momentum and followed by short squeezes?
Voyager‚Äôs CEO next week has earnings on the 25th and is joining a large blockchain conference Consensus to talk about Voyager.

During these meetings he could begin laying out some powerful customer metrics, expanding on some of these past announcements and take advantage of the Consensus to speak about technical improvements.
 
Some of these could alone drive a market momentum and short squeeze and at the start of the next business week he could drive the short squeeze even harder by doing stock buy backs.
 
Low liquidity and low-priced stocks are prime for this due to some of the tools to reduce market volume even further like we saw with GameStop.
 
My cautionary aspect is that he is unable to expand on some of these announcements and during the conference and earnings people are looking at Voyager unfavorably as they experience several outages along with other crypto exchanges. This cautionary aspect would hinder short term speculaters but I do not see it as a concern yet for long term holders given the high retention, and overall favorable reviews about the platform online.",,

Dude, really, you're hearing about Tesla more than their competitors because Teslas are most popular among redditors and zoomers who like to share their lives online. The boomers who can actually afford fancy new AI powered cars don't waste time posting about it online. Tesla have two things going for them, marketing, and range. Turns out 200km is enough for most consumers, beyond that there's diminishing utility. Competitors could boost the range, but the cost outweighs the demand from most consumers.

As for marketing, that only takes you so far. Maybe when the zoomers pay off their college debt, Tesla will take over the auto market, but I don't see that happening myself.",,

Or are you just assuming that?

&nbsp;

And no, the mods aren't going to just bend the rules (or outright get rid of them, rather) like you're asking for them to do. People can talk about whatever stock they want (assuming it's not a SPAC or a penny stock for obvious reasons) but that doesn't mean that every single kind of post is equal and valid.

Easy example, if I were to pretend to be a woman and start posting porn on here, and it were to be upvoted to the front page by a bunch of horny Redditors (not exactly unrealistic) should it be allowed to stay? What about if I made it vaguely market themed porn? Obviously that would be a case of people ""telling the mods what they like"" but that isn't because they think it's good content for WSB, it would be because they like tits in general.

People can talk about what they want but that doesn't mean everything belongs on every subreddit. A lot of people have been coming here for years because they enjoy WSB and the community that has been fostered here. That includes the general opposition to content that would be considered low effort and/or uninteresting. I get that a lot of new people showed up recently and don't fully understand the sub yet (although plenty of people have integrated successfully as well) but that doesn't mean that this community should alienate the people who have been here for years to cater to the new majority.

If you want a community with different visions then that is perfectly fine, I'm certainly not going to insult you over that, but I would ask that you not change *WSB* away from what has made WSB great all this time. It's perfectly fine to visit multiple subreddits, after all.",,

I'm tagging you to add some bear points, and then counter those points with the bull thesis:

Bears say:

1) GOS is suffering huge compression due to companies trying to net volume and the RKT-UWMC price war. UWMC is guiding for Gain on Sale of between .75%-1.15% which is a very significant decrease from Q4 2020 or even Q1 2021.

2) Refinance is slowing down due to higher interest rates.

Bulls Counter:

1) GOS nosediving after booming is natural as it's cyclical. People want to retain as much volume as possible. However, it then goes back to its historical medium of between 1.15%-1.85%.

2) Even at 75BPS, the company is profitable.

3) MSR's value should rise as interest rates rise, and can go high enough to cover expenses for the company as well as the dividend. 

4) They are lowering margin to acquire market share instead of doing acquisitions because it's cheaper for them and more efficient. Other companies don't have the systems they do, and UWMC's systems are the best in class.

5) Interest Rates are still the lowest they've ever been and below 2019. It's only ever been lower last year. 

6) They are purchase oriented, and have been except for 2020. 2018 and 2019 were more purchase heavy than refinance heavy. They also do better in a higher interest rate environment, because they can offer mortgage rates at roughly 15 BPS lower, and as they margin expand through technology it will increase. Home purchases are also complicated while refinance isn't, so time to close is heavily important. They are more than 2.3x faster than anyone else.",,

[$GC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/dudwlorvi3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb931a041ddf4f5b79d58c008d4badcb8b91b7c2)

First - let's take a look at the **1 year 1 day** chart. Here - we are breaking what appears to just be a broadening descending wedge (a massive one). The breakout point was **1853 -** and it needs to hold **1848** to stay intact. 

You can see we already got some follow through here. Now, price targets/resistances are **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3.** 

Keep in mind - the larger the pattern, the larger the move, **the longer it takes to play out.** This isn't going to happen overnight. Timeframe to complete the move is **3-6 months** \- and we could form lots of smaller patterns in between.

Every time we cross one of those resistances, it should become a support. Also note that upon reaching them, it's likely we consolidate for a few days. Overall - a super clean setup, and a play I've been eyeing since March. 

Lastly, keep in mind - for a setup of this magnitude, you want the **weekly close** for confirmation.

But - what makes this really interesting is the **10 year 1 week chart.**

[$GC 10 Year 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/ejdwc9xvj3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bdfbd8e014548cda17aaf6e754e28cd9abf651f)

Here, we have an absolutely massive cup and handle dating back to 2011. In this context - the addition of this data mainly means we can look for a much higher price target on the wedge breakout. 

As a result - I'm targeting $GC **2250 - 2500** within the next **year.** Remember what I said about timeframes. This could take quite a while. For this setup to trigger - I'm looking for the **monthly close** above that first breakout point.

And... that's it. Remember, technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. Fake outs can and do happen. That's why we identify **key levels** to tell where we are within a setup. Take it step by step.

***TL;DR -*** 

$GC above 1853 weekly close targets **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3**

I'm planning to continue doing weekly relative rotation analysis of the market, but wanted to create this mid week post to take a quick look at UWMC. Please let me know if another flair is more appropriate.

I'm not going to get into the financials, since plenty of solid DD has been done on that already. However, I did mention in my last post (analyzing the market sectors) that I would look into positions related to the real estate sector (XLRE).

My thought process here it to take a look at the short term momentum for this stock due to the recent positive earnings, great financials, positive future outlook, and upcoming June Ex-Div date.

Lets jump into it and make it quick...

Since there is a lot of talk regarding Russell inclusion, here is the RRG of UWMC again UWM:

**My Thoughts:**

Personally, the company has strong fundamentals. So, in combination with the momentum, I think its a decent ""buy"" (this is not professional financial advice).

I'm playing this 3 ways:

6/18 short put x 2 @ $7

7/16 long call x 5 @ $6

1100 shares @ $8.06

Edit 1: Silly me, I forgot to mention that a share buyback plan was approved which also contributes to the positive momentum.

What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either.

Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",ngftx1,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Mr. Cramer..."

3256,,2021-05-19 20:51:00,t3_nggpql,,wallstreetbets,"I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

3258,,2021-05-19 21:25:26,t3_nghmhm,,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",nghmhm,$NUE is strong as steel. Buy the dips.

Petco earnings is tomorrow pre-market. But this also might be a potential candidate for a short squeeze.

Short sellers are gearing up for a bad quarter. For the last three days, the short float increased from 4 point-something Monday, 6.05 yesterday, and today it's at 8.75.

In addition, short interest is up to 35.2%

To top it off, there are hardly any shares available to short, though borrowing rate remains at only 1%. For the last five days there were no more than 100k shares left to short.

The average price target is $28, but if earnings goes better than expected, this could be the catalyst for something significantly bigger. Listen to your pets' beckoning calls, and keep this on your watch list!

3270,,2021-05-20 05:24:49,t3_ngrqqf,,wallstreetbets,"Some context: Cell carriers in the US have decided to stop the function of shared short codes (5-6 digit phone numbers) June 1. Shared short codes were the preferred means of SMS and MMS communication for B2C traffic. Short codes were free to lease in many cases, text messages were cheap, thousands of businesses could send from the same number, and throughput was incredibly high (lots of messages could be sent very fast).

The new policy enforced by the CTIA (The private club all major cell phone carriers are in) is that shared short codes are to be discontinued and replaced by dedicated short codes and A2P 10dlc (approved B2C traffic on 10-digit phone numbers). This means that every business/organization that wants to send texts must either apply for a dedicated short code or apply for a 10DLC. 

Dedicated short codes are the preferred choice for large corporations. They can handle large throughput and look good for the brand. However, they only cater to large corporations because they are thousands of dollars/year to lease. Turn around time for application is 4-6 weeks. Barrier to entry is high.

10DLC is the preferred choice for the smaller businesses since it's less expensive. But, it is still far more expensive than the shared short codes businesses are used to, requires application, and costs $50/mo in carrier and registration fees alone. Turn around time for application is less than a week. On top of fees, 10dlc isn't even fully ready. The Campaign Registry, the organization responsible for rolling out ""the new messaging standard"" for the CTIA, is still developing their API.

Enter Toll-free messaging. TF has 0 barrier to entry and can be issued to a business with SMS and MMS capabilities in seconds. It's the easiest and now the most cost-effective way to send commercial messages.

Conveniently, every major carrier announced this month (for the first time) that they will start collecting a $0.0025/message fee for every sms sent. They're ready for and expecting businesses to move to this method.

Who is Zipwhip: Zipwhip was given full reign over all TF traffic. Anyone in the US  that wants to send messages on TF codes uses Zipwhip in one way or another. They are a massive reseller that everyone is required to go through.

It was recently announced the Twilio plans on acquiring Zipwhip for $850M. Twilio is the leader is programmable messaging hands down. 

Honestly, there should be antitrust issues that arise and block the acquisition. If it goes through, Twilio owns the new world of business sms. Good chance regulators won't notice any issue. They'll miss the fact that businesses will be pressured into TF over their preferred solutions (dedicated short codes and A2P 10DLC) since it's unnecessarily complicated and expensive. TF is ready now and cheap.

TL;DR if Twilio successfully acquires Zipwhip, every small to medium sized business that wants to send texts will have to go through them. Every single one of them in the US.",ngrqqf,$TWLO stands to be the primary source for commercial text messaging

3273,,2021-05-20 08:25:07,t3_ngulnq,,wallstreetbets,"So just how big is **today's news about the initial success of the Sofusa technology**?

1st, this is a technology that aims at lymphatic delivery. 

**What does this mean?** Well, when trying to fight a disease, it's difficult to target the lymphatic system. Because of how it works and the fact that it is spread throughout our body. 

So there are MANY, MANY drugs out there that treat several conditions through the lymphatic system. But, because of what we just explained, those drugs sometimes don't work. They are not properly ""delivered"". They don't get to where they need to get to make the necessary interaction and solve the problem.

**Sorrento has developed a technology that can deliver drugs to where they actually need to go** in the lymphatic system. So this is definitely breakthrough technology. Other companies are aiming to find similar solutions. But we are definitely talking about very advanced bio-tech.

In this case, we have a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. This is a condition that worsens with time. It's very painful and limits the patient's movement. It's not very common, so we are talking about 1.5 million people in the USA and about 30 million worldwide. 

But remember, **the technology Sorrento is developing  will be able to deliver drugs treating many other diseases** related to the lymphatic system. So the market for Sofusa is very, very large.

The press release tells us Sofusa was tested on ""First Enbrel-Non-Responding"" patients. 

**What does this mean?** Patients who need the drug Enbrel and, even though they have not been taking the drug for long (it's a ""first"" for them) they are not responding to it. It isn't helping them. 

Now, Sofusa comes into play. It's job is to deliver Enbrel to the patient effectively. To ""take"" Enbrel to where it needs to go in the lymphatic system.. 

The 1st obvious advantage is that the drug wasn't helping and now helps. But there are other important advantages.

Since the drug is being carried to its targeted ""destination"" the dosage needed, diminishes. Because less is ""lost along the way"". This is important because many diseases related to the lymphatic system, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are chronic, lifelong conditions. Being able to administer less drugs really helps the patient. Now you have a drug that actually works, more potently, which reduces its dosage. All this thanks to Sorrento.

The press release points out an important factor: This is a trial on ONE type of drug/treatment. Other such trials testing the effectiveness of Sofusa are already taking place. Again, this is proof of the potentially huge market for this delivery system.

Just to get an idea, the release mentions anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. These are a type of drugs that inhibit the activity of certain proteins (they inhibit PD1 and CTLA4, which are types of proteins. By stopping their activity, they help in stopping the growth of cancer tumors). There are several drugs that fall under these categories and treat a wide variety of cancers. **Sofusa can potentially play a vital role in all these treatments**. 

This is like several companies developing apps while Sorrento is developing a new smartphone technology. Each app has its rightful use and market. But once the new smartphone is up and working, all apps will need it. So this technology has huge revenue implications. T**he fact we are hearing good news about it is HUGE**.

As for the results themselves: **The DAS28 test measures rheumatoid activity in 28 joints** in the patient's body. The joints might be swollen or tender (hurting).

This patient had a DAS28 score of 4.6, with 18 out of 28 joints compromised.  That is considered  moderate to high disease activity.  There are 4 levels of DAS 28 scores going from remission (the best) to high (the worst). So this patient was not in the worst shape going in, but pretty bad.

Using Sofusa to deliver the Enbrel drug, in just 4 weeks (this is a very short time for this type of disease!!) the results went from 4.6 to 3.0. The total amount of compromised joints, from 18 to 11. **That is a dramatic change**. The patient went from being somewhere between level 3 and 4, to being in the lower level 2, called ""low disease activity"", which indicates it's moving towards remission (the lowest level). For someone suffering from this condition, it's a real life changer. For the company selling Enbrel, it's a real market changer. And if it can equally help people with tumors, **Sofusa becomes a major therapeutic factor.** 

I hope investors understand this. **It's another major development in an already extremely promising pipeline** which is currently badly undervalued. If the price doesn't spike today by 10-15%, as it should, just from this news, it would be disappointing. 

But if you are long, today's price change isn't what matters the most. It‚Äôs the understanding that Sorrento / SRNE has ANOTHER ace in its hand!",ngulnq,How Big is SRNE news release about Sofusa success?

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC and its +23% run in the past week. A stock with a massive dividend. A stock trading with a very low P/E of and income growth of 4,200%.

So why is this stock still a buy and hold for me right now?

The CEO is positioning them to increase shareholder value, but also position the company to weather any reduction in the refi market. (65% of the business)

There are major catalysts that have been driving the increase in price that goes beyond the attention gained on WSB.

* Announced **NET earnings of $860M in the first quarter,** with huge margins.
* Reaffirmed a continued dividend, the next ex-dividend date is **6/9/2021**.
* Announced a **$300M stock buyback, representing as much as 40% of the free float** at the current prices.
* Russell index inclusion was missed last quarter due to confusion about their PREVIOUS status as a SPAC. It is expected that they will be reconsidered for Russell Index inclusions in the yearly reconstitution. While not the biggest catalyst, this is a sign of reputation and long-term stability for the stock. **The prelim list publishes 6/4/2021.**
* Creation of a jumbo mortgage product. The average loan origination in the market is \~410,000, indicating that the non-conforming section of the mortgage market is *exploding.* This is a very profitable sector of loan origination.

Other fundamentals driving a buy recommendation:

* Small float. 90M float, of which only about 60M is freely trading.
* This stock is not persistently pressured down quite as hard as others due to low share availability, but it appears based on the last two weeks it's trading the small waves of this stock to try to push it down under dangerous strike prices. A wave of positive sentiment could strangle this position in the stock. I don't have a Bloomberg terminal, but based on the evidence over the last several days, the indication is the 13.1% SI has grown.
* Exceptional open option interest for **tomorrow 5/21/2021.** The options expiring tomorrow have been documented elsewhere so I won't belabor them, but the open interest at the $9, and $10 strike represent almost 10% of the free float.
* Not a new startup, **they have been in this business since 1986**, making them almost as old as a fossil like me. They clearly survived the 2008 storm. This company isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

The cherry:

* **STILL forecasting growth in Q2**, whereas many of its competitors are not.

This post is NOT financial advice, but as someone who has ridden the waves of this stock since it was about $9, I see this position turning positive and the outlook through July for this position has high sentiment. Even if the mortgage market slows down as expected, I will hold these shares for years to come for the dividends and general stability of the organization.

My position 8000 shares @ 7.65 and 45x 6/18 8c. You can go stalk the fuck out of me if you want to see that I've been talking about this stock for some time and been saying the same thing about the strength and targets of their position since March. I am also the guy that tells you when you unintentionally reveal personal info on your yolo screenshots!

TLDR: UWMC should garner close attention for value investors looking for undervalued positions.

3284,,2021-05-20 13:28:43,t3_nh08j4,,wallstreetbets,"**Investment Thesis**

Overall, what makes MDXG a good buying opportunity right now is a combination of two factors.

* Number one is management‚Äôs miscommunication with the market. The market currently believes that wound care is the core business of MDXG, is not entirely aware of the potential of its biopharma pipeline and more specifically its Amniofix drug, and has priced the company based on this.¬†
* Number two is the huge potential of the Amniofix treatment and its ability to become the next blockbuster in the healthcare space after the conclusion of its phase 3 trial.

**Idea Summary**

MiMedx Group *(MDXG)* is a leading BioPharma and wound care business whose value has been drastically misunderstood by the market. Through drivers such as miscommunication from management about the company‚Äôs valued proposition as well as the lack of institutional investor coverage, the market currently believes that the majority of the company‚Äôs value sits in its low growth wound care business. In reality, its major competitive advantage is within its osteoarthritis drug Amniofix which has the potential to become the next blockbuster after it clears phase III clinical trials. A sum of the parts valuation was used to determine a minimum implied upside of at least 300%. Risks are discussed at the end.

**Business Overview**

MiMedx Group is a leading biopharma and advanced wound care business utilizing human placental tissues to develop products used in the healthcare sector. It processes placental tissues using its patented processes to produce allografts, which are tissues transplanted from one person to another for wound care and regeneration. These allografts are effective in healing difficult wounds because of the ability of the allograft cells to quickly associate with the cells of the patient, thereby taking part in the healing process, easing the ability of the body to close the wound, and speeding up the body‚Äôs regeneration process.

MDXG‚Äôs product offerings can be split into two business segments: wound care and biopharma (surgical solutions). Its flagship product Epifix and additional product Epicord fall under its wound care umbrella, and its flagship product Amniofix as well as additional products Amniocord, Amniofill, and Epiburn fall under its biopharma umbrella. The wound care products service the broad wound care industry, targeting specifically chronic wounds. The biopharma product line is more specific, with the flagship treatment Amniofix targeting knee osteoarthritis in specific.¬†

MDXG sells through direct sales, sales agents, and distributors in the United States. This past quarter, 95% of its sales were direct to customers such as healthcare professionals and facilities.¬†

**Internal Analysis**

The past 3 years have not been ideal for MDXG. Its revenues began to dip in 2018 around the time of their accounting scandal, the growth went from 40% in 2018, to 11% in 2019, and is currently around -16%. This sent their stock price tumbling from $16 USD to lows of almost $1 USD, though it is currently trading at $9 with new updates on their biopharma pipeline.

Their gross margin has stayed very high, around 80% while their EBITDA margins have dropped over the years. Though it wasn‚Äôt explicitly disclosed, a large part of this drop in EBITDA margins has been attributed to a temporary increase in legal fees due to the litigation MDXG has faced this past year. Its decreased volume may have also suppressed margins as the number of wound care treatments in hospitals significantly dropped during COVID-19.¬†

The company‚Äôs cash balance is sitting at a very high level of 84 mm. This is in large part due to its recent capital raise, which happened to be strongly criticized by one of MDXG‚Äôs activist investors, Prescience Point Capital (discussed in detail later).

**External Analysis**

*Wound Care Market*

The global wound care market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% from 2021 to 2028. This has been driven by the aging population and rising rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Wound care products are increasingly being used to prevent and surgical site infections.¬†

Though the overall market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% the specific advanced product segment which includes products such as those of MDXG‚Äôs which target chronic and non-healing wounds, is projected to grow much faster than 4.1%.¬†

The wound care market is relatively fragmented, with large players such as Integra LifeSciences, 3M, Johnson & Johnson, and Medtronic competing to gain the most market share. MDXG‚Äôs direct competition for its allograft advanced wound care treatments include Organogenesis, Axogen, Mediwound, and Vericel.¬†

Organogenesis is currently in the lead in this niche market, and while MDXG reported an 11% YoY decline in sales in 2020 (which has already been factored into the current price), Organogenesis reported a 30% increase. This is evident when comparing the stock performance of both companies over the past year (figure 1)

*Osteoarthritis Therapy Market*

91 million U.S. adults have arthritis, 20M have knee OA, and \~32 million per year are currently treated for plantar fasciitis, which is specifically targeted by MDXG‚Äôs Amniofix drug. There are very few FDA approved treatments for knee OA and plantar fasciitis, and those that exist have low efficacy and many drawbacks. Amniofix is currently the only treatment of its nature in phase 3 clinical trials that have posted very positive results in both company and independent trials, has been used off-label by >100K patients with zero severe adverse effects, and consistently demonstrates a significant reduction in pain as reported by patients. In addition, Amniofix has an RMAT (regenerative medicine advanced therapy) designation granted by the FDA which allows for MDXG to benefit from an expedited approval process from the FDA.

*Management Miscommunication*

The current market opinion of MDXG has been blurred by the miscommunication from company management whose goals do not align with maximizing shareholder value. This is largely due to the fact that EW healthcare, a private equity firm, has 33% representation on the board as a result of its 17% stake. From a corporate finance perspective, a private equity firm‚Äôs interests do not generally tend to align with those of public shareholders. Their influence has been exacerbated by the fact that there are no large institutional holdings in MDXG as of yet other than Prescience Point, and there has been minimal coverage on the stock leading to the market‚Äôs opinion on the company being heavily skewed by management communications.¬†

MDXG‚Äôs current growth strategy is focused on roll-ups in the wound care space. This is very characteristic of a private equity playbook, and goes alongside EW‚Äôs historical acquisitions. As was mentioned in the external analysis, the wound care space is growing at a slow rate of \~4.1%, however MDXG has lost significant market share to Organogenesis. Management has failed to realize that the current value driver of the business is within its biopharma line and not its wound care line, yet has continually communicated to shareholders that it believes it is in fact wound care and it is going to continue investing in growing within the industry.

Prescience Point Capital, an activist investor group which has advocated for change in MDXG's communication strategy, has supported the fact that MDXG‚Äôs communications have been focused on the wrong industry. At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, the potential for the drug Amniofix was drastically undersold and much time was spent convincing investors that the core business is in wound care. The 3.6% decline in shares two days after the conference illustrates how effective this strategy was.¬†

There has been strong opposition from MDXG‚Äôs board of directors to Prescience Point‚Äôs activist efforts. In a shareholder letter in early May, prior to their annual meeting, the company communicated that they believe the wound care and regenerative medicine direction being followed now is ideal. They stated that the activist investor does not understand pharmaceutical company disclosure and were advocating for speculative actions themselves though Prescience‚Äôs report discusses the opposite, with them outlining how EW‚Äôs influence on the board of directors is shifting the company‚Äôs focus away from maximizing shareholder value.

*Amniofix*

As mentioned in the external analysis, there is currently no other treatment, either in development or on the market, as effective as Amniofix in treating knee OA and also just as safe. Most recently, at its Q1 earnings call, MDXG CEO shared positive results from the phase IIb prospective trial of the treatment. There was a statistically significant reduction in VAS (visual analog score) for pain and an improvement in the foot function index score. There were also no serious adverse events during this clinical trial. Amniofix is currently in phase III trials, and MDXG believes they are on target to meet all criteria needed to find a biologics license application (BLA) so that the treatment can be introduced to the general public. MDXG is aiming to file their BLA in the first half of 2022, meaning that within a year this blockbuster treatment could be on the market, and given the feedback so far from clinical trials as well as the RMAT designation, it is highly likely.

A Prescience Point market capture analysis estimated that the treatment would bring in $4,050 million of annual sales. This is \~8 times higher than the current sales brought in through wound care. One year ago it would have been prudent to not entirely incorporate this into the share price, however today with clinical trials nearing completion and MDXG‚Äôs new RMAT designation, the likelihood of approval is much higher.

**Valuation**

From a valuation point of view, a quick sum of the parts analysis is the most ideal given the two different business lines of MDXG. A more in-depth DCF can be created once more cost information is provided from MDXG after the conclusion of clinical trials.

Shares outstanding of 109.8 mm, total debt of 51.8 mm, and total cash of 84.7mm were used to convert from enterprise value to equity value. The current implied upside was calculated using the current price of $9.46.

*Wound Care Valuation*

MDXG‚Äôs FY 2021 sales guidance assumed $255 mm to $270 mm in revenue from the wound care segment. Different points in this revenue ranged were used for the low, base, and high cases of the valuation. An EV/Revenue multiple was used to calculate implied enterprise value. The comparables analysis shown in figure 2 illustrated the median multiples derived from the analysis done using the aforementioned list of MDXG‚Äôs competitors. A median multiple of 5.3x was used. The median was used and not marked down because the gross margin and UFCF yield of MDXG is in-line with all competitors. Though the EBIDTA multiple was lower, the similar yield and gross margins indicate that company performance is relatively the same. In addition, litigation expenses factored into the lower EBIDTA multiples and thus it is not indicative of recurring performance.

Based on the revenue multiples, implied share values for the wound care segment range between $12.0 and $12.8.

**Wound Care Equity Value**

**Biopharma Valuation**

Prescience Point estimated annual revenues from Amniofix through using the market capture method. The total market size (annual knee OA injections) was estimated, and a capture percentage was applied to determine the annual number of patients receiving the Amniofix injection. Prescience assumed 1.5 injections per year but to be more conservative in this valuation 1 was used. Price per injection and FDA approval probability varied by the cases and were used to adjust the EV/Rev multiple downwards. Overall, an implied share value range between $25.4 and $57.1 was calculated for this segment.

https://preview.redd.it/we0pw4jm1a071.png?width=611&format=png&auto=webp&s=567d19cc5acc59acbe552a2afcf09789c80866ff

**Biopharma Equity Value**

Overall, the total implied share price ranges between $37.43 to $69.81. As more information regarding Amniofix comes out including the price of manufacturing, different multiples can be used to fine-tune the analysis.

https://preview.redd.it/a8035yfo1a071.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=12e0f9a041e326b505bfda25304261367c651406

**Risks**

1. Given the high influence EW healthcare has on the board of directors, there is potential for more value to describe acquisitions such as that of stability biologics, which was bought for 10 million and sold for 3.5 million 3 years later. If such a trend continues, the value of MDXG‚Äôs wound care business can dramatically decrease, which will hurt the share pierce
2. The FDA approval of Amniofix is a large driver of the valuation calculated. There is a large risk that the FDA will not approve the treatment, however, with the RMAT designation in place and positive results from the first two phases of clinical trials, the odds are strongly in the favour of the approval at the current point in time.

Overall MDXG has been strongly misrepresented by management leading to a skewed opinion and pricing by the market.",nh08j4,$MDXG - Management Miscommunication Skews Valuation Down and Creates Great Buying Opportunity

If you aren't familiar with the efficient frontier, what it tries to find is the *mean-variance portfolio.* This type of model deals with portfolio management / optimization. In terms of the efficient frontier you are trying to find the best portfolio allocation weights that give you the best risk adjusted returns. 

**In simple words:** you give it stocks and it tells you the best percentage holdings

I recently built an app on some python code that does this sort of optimization. There is no programming required to use the app. When running the app it will give two portfolios, minimum variance, and maximized sharpe (same as mean-variance, mean-markowitz). Minimum variance will tell you the least riskiest holding strategy (green), and max sharpe will give you the best reward-for-risk holding (red).

The reason why I bring this up is because it does two things. The first is that it promotes portfolio diversification, which I know is pretty uncommon here. Also it finds the most aggressive returns in terms of minimizing risk. If you have high returns and wonder why you returns are so much higher than standard investment funds its probably because you are here

Yah you may good returns, you are probably taking on more risk than what you are getting in return.

How high could it go? Well If we take a look at the graph below, we can see that SPCE peaked at around 60 bucks  back in February in ANTICIPATION for the previous test flight which was delayed until May for safety reasons (They had some problems with electromagnetic interference which is fixed now).

So if the test flight actually happens on the 22nd, then could be really big boom. Currently the price is around 18-19 bucks, so it's an absolute steal in my opinion, but there is always the risk that some shit fucks up and the test flight is delayed even further, in which case I will have to sell the house.

In this post I'm going to not talk about some kind of currency that can get this post removed. Hint: it crashed big time yesterday. You know the one.

There is a new kind of this currency that uses a lot of computer storage space. How much? Well - 7 EXABYTES and it's currently adding 1 exabyte every 3 days. I'm going to assume you know about this currency and if not you can look through my post history and see which subreddit I've posted to recently involving this particular one.

#Topics of discussion:

* Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks

* WDC Fundamentals

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

My name is Nico, I'm a sophomore in college, and I think Gold ($GLD) is going to explode in value.

There are so many reasons as to why,  and I try to cover them in my [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M85FuEX02YE), but even then I think there's more room for discussion.

&#x200B;

Some of the reasons why I'm bullish on Gold include: the wealth effect, intrinsic vs extrinsic value, income effect (marginal propensity to consume), inflation (rising price levels), weakening of the dollar, uncertainty in the markets, luxury goods, the effect of government spending and stimulus, scarcity of natural resources, supply and demand, increasing costs to produce (oil, labor, machinery etc...).

Ten yeats ago they had a gain of 145 k $ now their up to 70 Million in 2020 

The stock price seems hard undervalued at 3.50 $.

Their is an estimated PER of over 100 in 2022 the stock hss now a PER of -50.

They had also a spike few years ago and survived the corona crisis with nearly no losses.

If this company will rise in gains like the last 10 years and the PER will stay the same. This company must be undervalued as hell.

Lithium will be the future (electric vehicles or batteries) and in some combination with some irons it could also be a very sustainable material.

The electric vehicle boom in the USA and europe could also leed to a higher lithium price which in that case Orocobre could even get to have wins in the next year (estimated next 5 quarters (estimation by myself)).

They also have an high developed technologie in use especially to mine in areas that arent very friendly to miners. And im not meaning the bedroom of youre grandmother.

So logically if this company dont even change something they are hardcore underrated by now, if they improve by then self they are underated now aswell but the stock could go even higher and if politics enviorment and electric hypes continue to love lithium, then ill guess this is the new spaceship to the moon.

\*\*\*My average in @ $5.10, currently at $5.52, May 20th, 2021

I am not investing in the company as a get-rich-quick scheme, but plan to hold long term. **Saphyr** technology will continue to improve directly with design improvements, but also indirectly with the data that it continuously collects will create more accurate correlations of DNA with individual predispositions for disease. 

I believe the technology will allow for a more personal approach in the field of medicine, and should not be viewed solely as a research-based company.  

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community. 

* **Large institutional investments have nearly tripled (3X) from 5% to 14%.** 
* **Earnings beat expectations in Q1 2021.**
* **Recent large insider procurement.**
* **New patents, research breakthroughs, Large Lab facility adoption.**

This is why I have a strong conviction for **Bionano Genomics (BNGO)** being a great growth stock to investigate and follow. 

There are some negative indicators fundamentally, but considering Bionano is still in its infancy I am very optimistic in my outlook. The positives tip the scale in my opinion and at the very least, Bianano Genomics (BNGO) should be on your watchlist!

Also, this past week AAPL has been testing it's 200 day moving average. If we continue the rally strong from this area then it will invalidate the head and shoulders pattern outlined above. If we close below that (currently @ $123.69) that would give more confirmation of this head and shoulders break to the downside.

Another point of interest is that the SlowRSI is currently @ 33.29. Typically a bottom is put in when this reaches the 20 level or below. This itself is no reason for a pullback, but everything said put together strengthens the pullback argument.

All said and done, I am bullish on AAPL but believe we need to see a deep pullback in order for it to be more attractive to the masses and drive more volume into the stock.

Made a small fortune on it this year. I don't believe in a squeeze to crazy highs, but I do believe in volatility. I also think GME has an interest case as a long-term investment.

It's the most popular retail stock in the world, and it has a pretty solid floor because of lunatic Redditors who I will use as my bagholders.

I will ride its volatility selling CCs until I am assigned.

You have a call option at 50 cents or above to be in money. Let's say 1 year away.  

Let's say to scenarios could play out.

1. What if price is at .40 goes to .55 and reverse split to 1.10. You own the strike price of .50 call option. Do you still buy 100 shares at 50 cents and then can double your money?

2. Let's say it goes to 30 cents and they have to do a 4 to 1 consolidation for the target compliance. They go to 1.20. does  this mean while the .50 call option is held? I still hold that strike? I understand after reverse split it could go down or up in value.

Can someone please help me understand so I can be a good investor.  If this shit is like magic the gathering it should hold 100 shares at the 50 strike price for a 50 percent gain I think.

[$GC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/dudwlorvi3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb931a041ddf4f5b79d58c008d4badcb8b91b7c2)

First - let's take a look at the **1 year 1 day** chart. Here - we are breaking what appears to just be a broadening descending wedge (a massive one). The breakout point was **1853 -** and it needs to hold **1848** to stay intact. 

You can see we already got some follow through here. Now, price targets/resistances are **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3.** 

Keep in mind - the larger the pattern, the larger the move, **the longer it takes to play out.** This isn't going to happen overnight. Timeframe to complete the move is **3-6 months** \- and we could form lots of smaller patterns in between.

Every time we cross one of those resistances, it should become a support. Also note that upon reaching them, it's likely we consolidate for a few days. Overall - a super clean setup, and a play I've been eyeing since March. 

Lastly, keep in mind - for a setup of this magnitude, you want the **weekly close** for confirmation.

But - what makes this really interesting is the **10 year 1 week chart.**

[$GC 10 Year 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/ejdwc9xvj3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bdfbd8e014548cda17aaf6e754e28cd9abf651f)

Here, we have an absolutely massive cup and handle dating back to 2011. In this context - the addition of this data mainly means we can look for a much higher price target on the wedge breakout. 

As a result - I'm targeting $GC **2250 - 2500** within the next **year.** Remember what I said about timeframes. This could take quite a while. For this setup to trigger - I'm looking for the **monthly close** above that first breakout point.

And... that's it. Remember, technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. Fake outs can and do happen. That's why we identify **key levels** to tell where we are within a setup. Take it step by step.

***TL;DR -*** 

$GC above 1853 weekly close targets **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3**

$GC above 1853 monthly close targets **2250, 2500**

I'm planning to continue doing weekly relative rotation analysis of the market, but wanted to create this mid week post to take a quick look at UWMC. Please let me know if another flair is more appropriate.

I'm not going to get into the financials, since plenty of solid DD has been done on that already. However, I did mention in my last post (analyzing the market sectors) that I would look into positions related to the real estate sector (XLRE).

My thought process here it to take a look at the short term momentum for this stock due to the recent positive earnings, great financials, positive future outlook, and upcoming June Ex-Div date.

Lets jump into it and make it quick...

Since there is a lot of talk regarding Russell inclusion, here is the RRG of UWMC again UWM:

**My Thoughts:**

Personally, the company has strong fundamentals. So, in combination with the momentum, I think its a decent ""buy"" (this is not professional financial advice).

I'm playing this 3 ways:

6/18 short put x 2 @ $7

7/16 long call x 5 @ $6

1100 shares @ $8.06

Edit 1: Silly me, I forgot to mention that a share buyback plan was approved which also contributes to the positive momentum.

She has decreased her position in Netflix.

I think that the increase size of her fund will continue to limit her ability to invest in anything interesting. The longshots in her portfolio which have had massive success are often successful because her fund's investment has massively increased their market cap.  She has also tied herself so tightly to Tesla that she can never hop off that ride. She's tied to the autopilot whether it goes to the moon or into a tree.

What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either.

4057,,2021-05-19 20:14:45,t3_ngftx1,,wallstreetbets,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",ngftx1,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Mr. Cramer..."

4060,,2021-05-19 20:51:00,t3_nggpql,,wallstreetbets,"I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",nghmhm,$NUE is strong as steel. Buy the dips.

Petco earnings is tomorrow pre-market. But this also might be a potential candidate for a short squeeze.

Short sellers are gearing up for a bad quarter. For the last three days, the short float increased from 4 point-something Monday, 6.05 yesterday, and today it's at 8.75.

In addition, short interest is up to 35.2%

To top it off, there are hardly any shares available to short, though borrowing rate remains at only 1%. For the last five days there were no more than 100k shares left to short.

The average price target is $28, but if earnings goes better than expected, this could be the catalyst for something significantly bigger. Listen to your pets' beckoning calls, and keep this on your watch list!

4074,,2021-05-20 05:24:49,t3_ngrqqf,,wallstreetbets,"Some context: Cell carriers in the US have decided to stop the function of shared short codes (5-6 digit phone numbers) June 1. Shared short codes were the preferred means of SMS and MMS communication for B2C traffic. Short codes were free to lease in many cases, text messages were cheap, thousands of businesses could send from the same number, and throughput was incredibly high (lots of messages could be sent very fast).

The new policy enforced by the CTIA (The private club all major cell phone carriers are in) is that shared short codes are to be discontinued and replaced by dedicated short codes and A2P 10dlc (approved B2C traffic on 10-digit phone numbers). This means that every business/organization that wants to send texts must either apply for a dedicated short code or apply for a 10DLC. 

Dedicated short codes are the preferred choice for large corporations. They can handle large throughput and look good for the brand. However, they only cater to large corporations because they are thousands of dollars/year to lease. Turn around time for application is 4-6 weeks. Barrier to entry is high.

10DLC is the preferred choice for the smaller businesses since it's less expensive. But, it is still far more expensive than the shared short codes businesses are used to, requires application, and costs $50/mo in carrier and registration fees alone. Turn around time for application is less than a week. On top of fees, 10dlc isn't even fully ready. The Campaign Registry, the organization responsible for rolling out ""the new messaging standard"" for the CTIA, is still developing their API.

Enter Toll-free messaging. TF has 0 barrier to entry and can be issued to a business with SMS and MMS capabilities in seconds. It's the easiest and now the most cost-effective way to send commercial messages.

Conveniently, every major carrier announced this month (for the first time) that they will start collecting a $0.0025/message fee for every sms sent. They're ready for and expecting businesses to move to this method.

Who is Zipwhip: Zipwhip was given full reign over all TF traffic. Anyone in the US  that wants to send messages on TF codes uses Zipwhip in one way or another. They are a massive reseller that everyone is required to go through.

It was recently announced the Twilio plans on acquiring Zipwhip for $850M. Twilio is the leader is programmable messaging hands down. 

Honestly, there should be antitrust issues that arise and block the acquisition. If it goes through, Twilio owns the new world of business sms. Good chance regulators won't notice any issue. They'll miss the fact that businesses will be pressured into TF over their preferred solutions (dedicated short codes and A2P 10DLC) since it's unnecessarily complicated and expensive. TF is ready now and cheap.

TL;DR if Twilio successfully acquires Zipwhip, every small to medium sized business that wants to send texts will have to go through them. Every single one of them in the US.",ngrqqf,$TWLO stands to be the primary source for commercial text messaging

4077,,2021-05-20 08:25:07,t3_ngulnq,,wallstreetbets,"So just how big is **today's news about the initial success of the Sofusa technology**?

1st, this is a technology that aims at lymphatic delivery. 

**What does this mean?** Well, when trying to fight a disease, it's difficult to target the lymphatic system. Because of how it works and the fact that it is spread throughout our body. 

So there are MANY, MANY drugs out there that treat several conditions through the lymphatic system. But, because of what we just explained, those drugs sometimes don't work. They are not properly ""delivered"". They don't get to where they need to get to make the necessary interaction and solve the problem.

**Sorrento has developed a technology that can deliver drugs to where they actually need to go** in the lymphatic system. So this is definitely breakthrough technology. Other companies are aiming to find similar solutions. But we are definitely talking about very advanced bio-tech.

In this case, we have a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. This is a condition that worsens with time. It's very painful and limits the patient's movement. It's not very common, so we are talking about 1.5 million people in the USA and about 30 million worldwide. 

But remember, **the technology Sorrento is developing  will be able to deliver drugs treating many other diseases** related to the lymphatic system. So the market for Sofusa is very, very large.

The press release tells us Sofusa was tested on ""First Enbrel-Non-Responding"" patients. 

**What does this mean?** Patients who need the drug Enbrel and, even though they have not been taking the drug for long (it's a ""first"" for them) they are not responding to it. It isn't helping them. 

Now, Sofusa comes into play. It's job is to deliver Enbrel to the patient effectively. To ""take"" Enbrel to where it needs to go in the lymphatic system.. 

The 1st obvious advantage is that the drug wasn't helping and now helps. But there are other important advantages.

Since the drug is being carried to its targeted ""destination"" the dosage needed, diminishes. Because less is ""lost along the way"". This is important because many diseases related to the lymphatic system, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are chronic, lifelong conditions. Being able to administer less drugs really helps the patient. Now you have a drug that actually works, more potently, which reduces its dosage. All this thanks to Sorrento.

The press release points out an important factor: This is a trial on ONE type of drug/treatment. Other such trials testing the effectiveness of Sofusa are already taking place. Again, this is proof of the potentially huge market for this delivery system.

Just to get an idea, the release mentions anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. These are a type of drugs that inhibit the activity of certain proteins (they inhibit PD1 and CTLA4, which are types of proteins. By stopping their activity, they help in stopping the growth of cancer tumors). There are several drugs that fall under these categories and treat a wide variety of cancers. **Sofusa can potentially play a vital role in all these treatments**. 

This is like several companies developing apps while Sorrento is developing a new smartphone technology. Each app has its rightful use and market. But once the new smartphone is up and working, all apps will need it. So this technology has huge revenue implications. T**he fact we are hearing good news about it is HUGE**.

As for the results themselves: **The DAS28 test measures rheumatoid activity in 28 joints** in the patient's body. The joints might be swollen or tender (hurting).

This patient had a DAS28 score of 4.6, with 18 out of 28 joints compromised.  That is considered  moderate to high disease activity.  There are 4 levels of DAS 28 scores going from remission (the best) to high (the worst). So this patient was not in the worst shape going in, but pretty bad.

Using Sofusa to deliver the Enbrel drug, in just 4 weeks (this is a very short time for this type of disease!!) the results went from 4.6 to 3.0. The total amount of compromised joints, from 18 to 11. **That is a dramatic change**. The patient went from being somewhere between level 3 and 4, to being in the lower level 2, called ""low disease activity"", which indicates it's moving towards remission (the lowest level). For someone suffering from this condition, it's a real life changer. For the company selling Enbrel, it's a real market changer. And if it can equally help people with tumors, **Sofusa becomes a major therapeutic factor.** 

I hope investors understand this. **It's another major development in an already extremely promising pipeline** which is currently badly undervalued. If the price doesn't spike today by 10-15%, as it should, just from this news, it would be disappointing. 

But if you are long, today's price change isn't what matters the most. It‚Äôs the understanding that Sorrento / SRNE has ANOTHER ace in its hand!",ngulnq,How Big is SRNE news release about Sofusa success?

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC and its +23% run in the past week. A stock with a massive dividend. A stock trading with a very low P/E of and income growth of 4,200%.

So why is this stock still a buy and hold for me right now?

The CEO is positioning them to increase shareholder value, but also position the company to weather any reduction in the refi market. (65% of the business)

There are major catalysts that have been driving the increase in price that goes beyond the attention gained on WSB.

* Announced **NET earnings of $860M in the first quarter,** with huge margins.
* Reaffirmed a continued dividend, the next ex-dividend date is **6/9/2021**.
* Announced a **$300M stock buyback, representing as much as 40% of the free float** at the current prices.
* Russell index inclusion was missed last quarter due to confusion about their PREVIOUS status as a SPAC. It is expected that they will be reconsidered for Russell Index inclusions in the yearly reconstitution. While not the biggest catalyst, this is a sign of reputation and long-term stability for the stock. **The prelim list publishes 6/4/2021.**
* Creation of a jumbo mortgage product. The average loan origination in the market is \~410,000, indicating that the non-conforming section of the mortgage market is *exploding.* This is a very profitable sector of loan origination.

Other fundamentals driving a buy recommendation:

* Small float. 90M float, of which only about 60M is freely trading.
* This stock is not persistently pressured down quite as hard as others due to low share availability, but it appears based on the last two weeks it's trading the small waves of this stock to try to push it down under dangerous strike prices. A wave of positive sentiment could strangle this position in the stock. I don't have a Bloomberg terminal, but based on the evidence over the last several days, the indication is the 13.1% SI has grown.
* Exceptional open option interest for **tomorrow 5/21/2021.** The options expiring tomorrow have been documented elsewhere so I won't belabor them, but the open interest at the $9, and $10 strike represent almost 10% of the free float.
* Not a new startup, **they have been in this business since 1986**, making them almost as old as a fossil like me. They clearly survived the 2008 storm. This company isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

The cherry:

* **STILL forecasting growth in Q2**, whereas many of its competitors are not.

This post is NOT financial advice, but as someone who has ridden the waves of this stock since it was about $9, I see this position turning positive and the outlook through July for this position has high sentiment. Even if the mortgage market slows down as expected, I will hold these shares for years to come for the dividends and general stability of the organization.

My position 8000 shares @ 7.65 and 45x 6/18 8c. You can go stalk the fuck out of me if you want to see that I've been talking about this stock for some time and been saying the same thing about the strength and targets of their position since March. I am also the guy that tells you when you unintentionally reveal personal info on your yolo screenshots!

TLDR: UWMC should garner close attention for value investors looking for undervalued positions.

4088,,2021-05-20 13:28:43,t3_nh08j4,,wallstreetbets,"**Investment Thesis**

Overall, what makes MDXG a good buying opportunity right now is a combination of two factors.

* Number one is management‚Äôs miscommunication with the market. The market currently believes that wound care is the core business of MDXG, is not entirely aware of the potential of its biopharma pipeline and more specifically its Amniofix drug, and has priced the company based on this.¬†
* Number two is the huge potential of the Amniofix treatment and its ability to become the next blockbuster in the healthcare space after the conclusion of its phase 3 trial.

**Idea Summary**

MiMedx Group *(MDXG)* is a leading BioPharma and wound care business whose value has been drastically misunderstood by the market. Through drivers such as miscommunication from management about the company‚Äôs valued proposition as well as the lack of institutional investor coverage, the market currently believes that the majority of the company‚Äôs value sits in its low growth wound care business. In reality, its major competitive advantage is within its osteoarthritis drug Amniofix which has the potential to become the next blockbuster after it clears phase III clinical trials. A sum of the parts valuation was used to determine a minimum implied upside of at least 300%. Risks are discussed at the end.

**Business Overview**

MiMedx Group is a leading biopharma and advanced wound care business utilizing human placental tissues to develop products used in the healthcare sector. It processes placental tissues using its patented processes to produce allografts, which are tissues transplanted from one person to another for wound care and regeneration. These allografts are effective in healing difficult wounds because of the ability of the allograft cells to quickly associate with the cells of the patient, thereby taking part in the healing process, easing the ability of the body to close the wound, and speeding up the body‚Äôs regeneration process.

MDXG‚Äôs product offerings can be split into two business segments: wound care and biopharma (surgical solutions). Its flagship product Epifix and additional product Epicord fall under its wound care umbrella, and its flagship product Amniofix as well as additional products Amniocord, Amniofill, and Epiburn fall under its biopharma umbrella. The wound care products service the broad wound care industry, targeting specifically chronic wounds. The biopharma product line is more specific, with the flagship treatment Amniofix targeting knee osteoarthritis in specific.¬†

MDXG sells through direct sales, sales agents, and distributors in the United States. This past quarter, 95% of its sales were direct to customers such as healthcare professionals and facilities.¬†

**Internal Analysis**

The past 3 years have not been ideal for MDXG. Its revenues began to dip in 2018 around the time of their accounting scandal, the growth went from 40% in 2018, to 11% in 2019, and is currently around -16%. This sent their stock price tumbling from $16 USD to lows of almost $1 USD, though it is currently trading at $9 with new updates on their biopharma pipeline.

Their gross margin has stayed very high, around 80% while their EBITDA margins have dropped over the years. Though it wasn‚Äôt explicitly disclosed, a large part of this drop in EBITDA margins has been attributed to a temporary increase in legal fees due to the litigation MDXG has faced this past year. Its decreased volume may have also suppressed margins as the number of wound care treatments in hospitals significantly dropped during COVID-19.¬†

The company‚Äôs cash balance is sitting at a very high level of 84 mm. This is in large part due to its recent capital raise, which happened to be strongly criticized by one of MDXG‚Äôs activist investors, Prescience Point Capital (discussed in detail later).

**External Analysis**

*Wound Care Market*

The global wound care market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% from 2021 to 2028. This has been driven by the aging population and rising rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Wound care products are increasingly being used to prevent and surgical site infections.¬†

Though the overall market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% the specific advanced product segment which includes products such as those of MDXG‚Äôs which target chronic and non-healing wounds, is projected to grow much faster than 4.1%.¬†

The wound care market is relatively fragmented, with large players such as Integra LifeSciences, 3M, Johnson & Johnson, and Medtronic competing to gain the most market share. MDXG‚Äôs direct competition for its allograft advanced wound care treatments include Organogenesis, Axogen, Mediwound, and Vericel.¬†

Organogenesis is currently in the lead in this niche market, and while MDXG reported an 11% YoY decline in sales in 2020 (which has already been factored into the current price), Organogenesis reported a 30% increase. This is evident when comparing the stock performance of both companies over the past year (figure 1)

*Osteoarthritis Therapy Market*

91 million U.S. adults have arthritis, 20M have knee OA, and \~32 million per year are currently treated for plantar fasciitis, which is specifically targeted by MDXG‚Äôs Amniofix drug. There are very few FDA approved treatments for knee OA and plantar fasciitis, and those that exist have low efficacy and many drawbacks. Amniofix is currently the only treatment of its nature in phase 3 clinical trials that have posted very positive results in both company and independent trials, has been used off-label by >100K patients with zero severe adverse effects, and consistently demonstrates a significant reduction in pain as reported by patients. In addition, Amniofix has an RMAT (regenerative medicine advanced therapy) designation granted by the FDA which allows for MDXG to benefit from an expedited approval process from the FDA.

*Management Miscommunication*

The current market opinion of MDXG has been blurred by the miscommunication from company management whose goals do not align with maximizing shareholder value. This is largely due to the fact that EW healthcare, a private equity firm, has 33% representation on the board as a result of its 17% stake. From a corporate finance perspective, a private equity firm‚Äôs interests do not generally tend to align with those of public shareholders. Their influence has been exacerbated by the fact that there are no large institutional holdings in MDXG as of yet other than Prescience Point, and there has been minimal coverage on the stock leading to the market‚Äôs opinion on the company being heavily skewed by management communications.¬†

MDXG‚Äôs current growth strategy is focused on roll-ups in the wound care space. This is very characteristic of a private equity playbook, and goes alongside EW‚Äôs historical acquisitions. As was mentioned in the external analysis, the wound care space is growing at a slow rate of \~4.1%, however MDXG has lost significant market share to Organogenesis. Management has failed to realize that the current value driver of the business is within its biopharma line and not its wound care line, yet has continually communicated to shareholders that it believes it is in fact wound care and it is going to continue investing in growing within the industry.

Prescience Point Capital, an activist investor group which has advocated for change in MDXG's communication strategy, has supported the fact that MDXG‚Äôs communications have been focused on the wrong industry. At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, the potential for the drug Amniofix was drastically undersold and much time was spent convincing investors that the core business is in wound care. The 3.6% decline in shares two days after the conference illustrates how effective this strategy was.¬†

There has been strong opposition from MDXG‚Äôs board of directors to Prescience Point‚Äôs activist efforts. In a shareholder letter in early May, prior to their annual meeting, the company communicated that they believe the wound care and regenerative medicine direction being followed now is ideal. They stated that the activist investor does not understand pharmaceutical company disclosure and were advocating for speculative actions themselves though Prescience‚Äôs report discusses the opposite, with them outlining how EW‚Äôs influence on the board of directors is shifting the company‚Äôs focus away from maximizing shareholder value.

*Amniofix*

As mentioned in the external analysis, there is currently no other treatment, either in development or on the market, as effective as Amniofix in treating knee OA and also just as safe. Most recently, at its Q1 earnings call, MDXG CEO shared positive results from the phase IIb prospective trial of the treatment. There was a statistically significant reduction in VAS (visual analog score) for pain and an improvement in the foot function index score. There were also no serious adverse events during this clinical trial. Amniofix is currently in phase III trials, and MDXG believes they are on target to meet all criteria needed to find a biologics license application (BLA) so that the treatment can be introduced to the general public. MDXG is aiming to file their BLA in the first half of 2022, meaning that within a year this blockbuster treatment could be on the market, and given the feedback so far from clinical trials as well as the RMAT designation, it is highly likely.

A Prescience Point market capture analysis estimated that the treatment would bring in $4,050 million of annual sales. This is \~8 times higher than the current sales brought in through wound care. One year ago it would have been prudent to not entirely incorporate this into the share price, however today with clinical trials nearing completion and MDXG‚Äôs new RMAT designation, the likelihood of approval is much higher.

**Valuation**

From a valuation point of view, a quick sum of the parts analysis is the most ideal given the two different business lines of MDXG. A more in-depth DCF can be created once more cost information is provided from MDXG after the conclusion of clinical trials.

Shares outstanding of 109.8 mm, total debt of 51.8 mm, and total cash of 84.7mm were used to convert from enterprise value to equity value. The current implied upside was calculated using the current price of $9.46.

*Wound Care Valuation*

MDXG‚Äôs FY 2021 sales guidance assumed $255 mm to $270 mm in revenue from the wound care segment. Different points in this revenue ranged were used for the low, base, and high cases of the valuation. An EV/Revenue multiple was used to calculate implied enterprise value. The comparables analysis shown in figure 2 illustrated the median multiples derived from the analysis done using the aforementioned list of MDXG‚Äôs competitors. A median multiple of 5.3x was used. The median was used and not marked down because the gross margin and UFCF yield of MDXG is in-line with all competitors. Though the EBIDTA multiple was lower, the similar yield and gross margins indicate that company performance is relatively the same. In addition, litigation expenses factored into the lower EBIDTA multiples and thus it is not indicative of recurring performance.

Based on the revenue multiples, implied share values for the wound care segment range between $12.0 and $12.8.

**Wound Care Equity Value**

**Biopharma Valuation**

Prescience Point estimated annual revenues from Amniofix through using the market capture method. The total market size (annual knee OA injections) was estimated, and a capture percentage was applied to determine the annual number of patients receiving the Amniofix injection. Prescience assumed 1.5 injections per year but to be more conservative in this valuation 1 was used. Price per injection and FDA approval probability varied by the cases and were used to adjust the EV/Rev multiple downwards. Overall, an implied share value range between $25.4 and $57.1 was calculated for this segment.

https://preview.redd.it/we0pw4jm1a071.png?width=611&format=png&auto=webp&s=567d19cc5acc59acbe552a2afcf09789c80866ff

**Biopharma Equity Value**

Overall, the total implied share price ranges between $37.43 to $69.81. As more information regarding Amniofix comes out including the price of manufacturing, different multiples can be used to fine-tune the analysis.

https://preview.redd.it/a8035yfo1a071.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=12e0f9a041e326b505bfda25304261367c651406

**Risks**

1. Given the high influence EW healthcare has on the board of directors, there is potential for more value to describe acquisitions such as that of stability biologics, which was bought for 10 million and sold for 3.5 million 3 years later. If such a trend continues, the value of MDXG‚Äôs wound care business can dramatically decrease, which will hurt the share pierce
2. The FDA approval of Amniofix is a large driver of the valuation calculated. There is a large risk that the FDA will not approve the treatment, however, with the RMAT designation in place and positive results from the first two phases of clinical trials, the odds are strongly in the favour of the approval at the current point in time.

If you aren't familiar with the efficient frontier, what it tries to find is the *mean-variance portfolio.* This type of model deals with portfolio management / optimization. In terms of the efficient frontier you are trying to find the best portfolio allocation weights that give you the best risk adjusted returns. 

**In simple words:** you give it stocks and it tells you the best percentage holdings

I recently built an app on some python code that does this sort of optimization. There is no programming required to use the app. When running the app it will give two portfolios, minimum variance, and maximized sharpe (same as mean-variance, mean-markowitz). Minimum variance will tell you the least riskiest holding strategy (green), and max sharpe will give you the best reward-for-risk holding (red). I call that portfolio *the-juice-is-worth-the-squeeze.* Here is a sample output.

I used around 100,000 simulations, and 10Y of adjusted close data. 

The reason why I bring this up is because it does two things. The first is that it promotes portfolio diversification, which I know is pretty uncommon here. Also it finds the most aggressive returns in terms of minimizing risk. If you have high returns and wonder why you returns are so much higher than standard investment funds its probably because you are here

* Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks

* WDC Fundamentals

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

\*\*\*My average in @ $5.10, currently at $5.52, May 20th, 2021

I am not investing in the company as a get-rich-quick scheme, but plan to hold long term. **Saphyr** technology will continue to improve directly with design improvements, but also indirectly with the data that it continuously collects will create more accurate correlations of DNA with individual predispositions for disease. 

I believe the technology will allow for a more personal approach in the field of medicine, and should not be viewed solely as a research-based company.  

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community. 

* **Large institutional investments have nearly tripled (3X) from 5% to 14%.** 
* **Earnings beat expectations in Q1 2021.**
* **Recent large insider procurement.**
* **New patents, research breakthroughs, Large Lab facility adoption.**

This is why I have a strong conviction for **Bionano Genomics (BNGO)** being a great growth stock to investigate and follow. 

There are some negative indicators fundamentally, but considering Bionano is still in its infancy I am very optimistic in my outlook. The positives tip the scale in my opinion and at the very least, Bianano Genomics (BNGO) should be on your watchlist!

**I look forward to the comments and welcome skeptical viewpoints. Open to hearing what other perceptions and expectations are of this company, Thanks for reading!!!!**

If we see a reversal back to the down side there could be a large pullback since this would confirm a daily head and shoulders break to the down side. Looking for a measured move from head the neckline, which falls the in the range of also filling a gap @ $96.19.

https://preview.redd.it/5vud70vi9b071.png?width=2612&format=png&auto=webp&s=2683dbb1bd8257c82ad5a0133e2f5b01e0feeaa4

Also, this past week AAPL has been testing it's 200 day moving average. If we continue the rally strong from this area then it will invalidate the head and shoulders pattern outlined above. If we close below that (currently @ $123.69) that would give more confirmation of this head and shoulders break to the downside.

Another point of interest is that the SlowRSI is currently @ 33.29. Typically a bottom is put in when this reaches the 20 level or below. This itself is no reason for a pullback, but everything said put together strengthens the pullback argument.

All said and done, I am bullish on AAPL but believe we need to see a deep pullback in order for it to be more attractive to the masses and drive more volume into the stock. After this potential pullback I can see AAPL rallying hard to the upside, so pay attention and be patient for a good entry.",nh6ijq,AAPL - Potential Daily Head and Shoulders pattern breaking

The issues I mentioned involved its impact on efficiency and the greater forces involved on hitting bumps, which this article does not address (to be honest, it does gloss over when road surfaces get rougher, but does not alleviate the concerns there).

Maintenance of an EV with the motor suspended is very simple as you have your half-shaft connecting your wheel to the motor. The motor is better protected so it will have less maintenance issues. The wheels get less abuse, so less maintenance issues. And frankly half-shafts should last the life of the vehicle without any major maintenance.

Regarding efficiency of transferring form a motor mounted via half-shafts versus in-wheel motors. Inherently a mounted motor allows you to use reduction gears and have greater flexibility resulting in a more efficient motor to begin with. Further, the losses of turning a half-shaft are probably very minimal and far less than unsprung weight causes. If LMC ever manages to release a vehicle for someone to test, I guess we can look at the weight, the kWh's, and range in real-life to get a better idea of what the real efficiency losses are.",,

AMC is the largest theater chain and is currently undervalued compared to its competitors (Regal and Cinemark). I think a squeeze is unlikely but it will climb. How long that climb is sustainable is yet to be seen. I don't have faith in AMC leadership (like you said, not a great stock from the start) and the pandemic has really expedited alternative distribution methods that I don't see going away. If AMC positions itself to be more than just a theater but a large-screen venue they could see a boost.

Things are open but theaters rely on the exclusive distribution of movies to get people in to buy their stuff. The model isn't great long-term and while a lot of people are eager to get back into theaters, there will be a trickle of movies and I believe streaming will really eat into their share.

There may be some movies that may draw me to a theater just for the experience, but I'd much rather stay home, save my money, and watch it the same day it gets released in theaters and streaming services.

The management team has figured out, where most have not, the opportunity that is Lago Vista. They are now building modular condos in Lago Vista, they surprised with an earnings beat and higher guidance and the stock is up 8% today.. I just bought 1,000 shares even up 8% today (12% short interest):

The National Media has been slow to see the story out there and SGBX is taking advantage of it:  
  
https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/stockdetails/fi-a22tvh  
  
SGB Development Corp should understand that to get water and utilities to the new Tessara Development, they ran those right by where this lot is for sale. Several months ago the old 58 acre private golf course that closed in 2000 sold. The City is historically Republican, the HOA is easy on building and there isn't a lot of Cynthia's out there. But the conservative city makes the developers put the utilities in whereas some cities to stimulate growth will do that. So developers in Lago Vista are building where utilities are near. The cheapest lot without utilities is worth about $30,000, the cheapest lot with utilities is about $75,000. A developer that bought this lot would not have far to run utilities to get to these lots and would have a whole hell of a lot of equity in the lot just getting the utilities put in. 5GB Development should buy this lot, it's also on one of the flattest part of Lago Vista (makes clearing and pouring the cement easy):

You cannot find a gas car capable of these specs. This is because voltage and current from a battery can be manipulated and induced to maximize power with very few limitations, whereas a gas is limited by the mechanical limitations of the engine. The Ford EV F150 can go 0-60 mph in 4 seconds which is 1 second faster than ford‚Äôs fastest truck. The Ford EV F150 is claimed to be Ford‚Äôs most powerful truck with 560 HP. The only draw back is the charging location. Once fast DC charging is widely available, gas cars will be on the decline.

I'm planning to continue doing weekly relative rotation analysis of the market, but wanted to create this mid week post to take a quick look at UWMC. Please let me know if another flair is more appropriate.

I'm not going to get into the financials, since plenty of solid DD has been done on that already. However, I did mention in my last post (analyzing the market sectors) that I would look into positions related to the real estate sector (XLRE).

My thought process here it to take a look at the short term momentum for this stock due to the recent positive earnings, great financials, positive future outlook, and upcoming June Ex-Div date.

Lets jump into it and make it quick...

Since there is a lot of talk regarding Russell inclusion, here is the RRG of UWMC again UWM:

[Looks like we have strong short term momentum when compared to the Russell 2000](https://preview.redd.it/4jlcf06t74071.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=aaf27b245685d1ecf8e0d0d5937216f3d1ef719d)

Now for SPY:

Finally, XLRE:

[No surprise. Similar to SPY](https://preview.redd.it/azj0le6i84071.png?width=893&format=png&auto=webp&s=84491c3d259a601a72339f9a7f53a7dc1078e3a1)

**My Thoughts:**

Personally, the company has strong fundamentals. So, in combination with the momentum, I think its a decent ""buy"" (this is not professional financial advice).

I'm playing this 3 ways:

6/18 short put x 2 @ $7

7/16 long call x 5 @ $6

1100 shares @ $8.06

Edit 1: Silly me, I forgot to mention that a share buyback plan was approved which also contributes to the positive momentum.

From the minute I heard the interview I realized that this person had no clue what she was talking about. To the credit of the Podcast hosts they mentioned that ARKK would have issues with outflows leading to lower stock prices in a later Podcast, which they have. I should have shorted it, but I'm not rich. Here are some of her stances:

She predicts CoinBit $500,000.

She is all-in on Tesla.

She thinks gene editing is a sound investment at this time.

She has decreased her position in Netflix.

&#x200B;

I think that the increase size of her fund will continue to limit her ability to invest in anything interesting. The longshots in her portfolio which have had massive success are often successful because her fund's investment has massively increased their market cap.  She has also tied herself so tightly to Tesla that she can never hop off that ride. She's tied to the autopilot whether it goes to the moon or into a tree. I'm not denying that she has had good results during this bull market, but I think a fund that goes the other direction will do very well over the next 5 years.

What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either. 

Here is some better and more thought out DD:

5572,,2021-05-19 20:14:45,t3_ngftx1,,wallstreetbets,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Big tech's earnings absolutely destroyed estimates but sell side thinks it's due to lock down and people will rely on tech less once things open up. It's a consistent pattern that all the gains made after earning erode overnight or in a few trading session as if the good earning did not happen. 

At the same time, the indexes are still hover around all time high. Remember how excited this sub was when SPY edging $400 and we are now still at $410. Meanwhile small growth stocks have 5% - 10% up and down days regularly and overall down 30% - 50% from ATH.

5575,,2021-05-19 20:51:00,t3_nggpql,,wallstreetbets,"I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

5577,,2021-05-19 21:25:26,t3_nghmhm,,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",nghmhm,$NUE is strong as steel. Buy the dips.

Petco earnings is tomorrow pre-market. But this also might be a potential candidate for a short squeeze.

Short sellers are gearing up for a bad quarter. For the last three days, the short float increased from 4 point-something Monday, 6.05 yesterday, and today it's at 8.75.

In addition, short interest is up to 35.2%

To top it off, there are hardly any shares available to short, though borrowing rate remains at only 1%. For the last five days there were no more than 100k shares left to short.

The average price target is $28, but if earnings goes better than expected, this could be the catalyst for something significantly bigger. Listen to your pets' beckoning calls, and keep this on your watch list!

5589,,2021-05-20 05:24:49,t3_ngrqqf,,wallstreetbets,"Some context: Cell carriers in the US have decided to stop the function of shared short codes (5-6 digit phone numbers) June 1. Shared short codes were the preferred means of SMS and MMS communication for B2C traffic. Short codes were free to lease in many cases, text messages were cheap, thousands of businesses could send from the same number, and throughput was incredibly high (lots of messages could be sent very fast).

The new policy enforced by the CTIA (The private club all major cell phone carriers are in) is that shared short codes are to be discontinued and replaced by dedicated short codes and A2P 10dlc (approved B2C traffic on 10-digit phone numbers). This means that every business/organization that wants to send texts must either apply for a dedicated short code or apply for a 10DLC. 

Dedicated short codes are the preferred choice for large corporations. They can handle large throughput and look good for the brand. However, they only cater to large corporations because they are thousands of dollars/year to lease. Turn around time for application is 4-6 weeks. Barrier to entry is high.

10DLC is the preferred choice for the smaller businesses since it's less expensive. But, it is still far more expensive than the shared short codes businesses are used to, requires application, and costs $50/mo in carrier and registration fees alone. Turn around time for application is less than a week. On top of fees, 10dlc isn't even fully ready. The Campaign Registry, the organization responsible for rolling out ""the new messaging standard"" for the CTIA, is still developing their API.

Enter Toll-free messaging. TF has 0 barrier to entry and can be issued to a business with SMS and MMS capabilities in seconds. It's the easiest and now the most cost-effective way to send commercial messages.

Conveniently, every major carrier announced this month (for the first time) that they will start collecting a $0.0025/message fee for every sms sent. They're ready for and expecting businesses to move to this method.

Who is Zipwhip: Zipwhip was given full reign over all TF traffic. Anyone in the US  that wants to send messages on TF codes uses Zipwhip in one way or another. They are a massive reseller that everyone is required to go through.

It was recently announced the Twilio plans on acquiring Zipwhip for $850M. Twilio is the leader is programmable messaging hands down. 

Honestly, there should be antitrust issues that arise and block the acquisition. If it goes through, Twilio owns the new world of business sms. Good chance regulators won't notice any issue.

5592,,2021-05-20 08:25:07,t3_ngulnq,,wallstreetbets,"So just how big is **today's news about the initial success of the Sofusa technology**?

1st, this is a technology that aims at lymphatic delivery. 

**What does this mean?** Well, when trying to fight a disease, it's difficult to target the lymphatic system. Because of how it works and the fact that it is spread throughout our body. 

So there are MANY, MANY drugs out there that treat several conditions through the lymphatic system. But, because of what we just explained, those drugs sometimes don't work. They are not properly ""delivered"". They don't get to where they need to get to make the necessary interaction and solve the problem.

**Sorrento has developed a technology that can deliver drugs to where they actually need to go** in the lymphatic system. So this is definitely breakthrough technology. Other companies are aiming to find similar solutions. But we are definitely talking about very advanced bio-tech.

In this case, we have a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. This is a condition that worsens with time. It's very painful and limits the patient's movement. It's not very common, so we are talking about 1.5 million people in the USA and about 30 million worldwide. 

But remember, **the technology Sorrento is developing  will be able to deliver drugs treating many other diseases** related to the lymphatic system. So the market for Sofusa is very, very large.

The press release tells us Sofusa was tested on ""First Enbrel-Non-Responding"" patients. 

**What does this mean?** Patients who need the drug Enbrel and, even though they have not been taking the drug for long (it's a ""first"" for them) they are not responding to it. It isn't helping them. 

Now, Sofusa comes into play. It's job is to deliver Enbrel to the patient effectively. To ""take"" Enbrel to where it needs to go in the lymphatic system.. 

The 1st obvious advantage is that the drug wasn't helping and now helps. But there are other important advantages.

Since the drug is being carried to its targeted ""destination"" the dosage needed, diminishes. Because less is ""lost along the way"". This is important because many diseases related to the lymphatic system, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are chronic, lifelong conditions. Being able to administer less drugs really helps the patient. Now you have a drug that actually works, more potently, which reduces its dosage. All this thanks to Sorrento.

The press release points out an important factor: This is a trial on ONE type of drug/treatment. Other such trials testing the effectiveness of Sofusa are already taking place. Again, this is proof of the potentially huge market for this delivery system.

Just to get an idea, the release mentions anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. These are a type of drugs that inhibit the activity of certain proteins (they inhibit PD1 and CTLA4, which are types of proteins. By stopping their activity, they help in stopping the growth of cancer tumors). There are several drugs that fall under these categories and treat a wide variety of cancers. **Sofusa can potentially play a vital role in all these treatments**. 

This is like several companies developing apps while Sorrento is developing a new smartphone technology. Each app has its rightful use and market. But once the new smartphone is up and working, all apps will need it. So this technology has huge revenue implications. T**he fact we are hearing good news about it is HUGE**.

As for the results themselves: **The DAS28 test measures rheumatoid activity in 28 joints** in the patient's body. The joints might be swollen or tender (hurting).

This patient had a DAS28 score of 4.6, with 18 out of 28 joints compromised.  That is considered  moderate to high disease activity.  There are 4 levels of DAS 28 scores going from remission (the best) to high (the worst). So this patient was not in the worst shape going in, but pretty bad.

Using Sofusa to deliver the Enbrel drug, in just 4 weeks (this is a very short time for this type of disease!!) the results went from 4.6 to 3.0. The total amount of compromised joints, from 18 to 11. **That is a dramatic change**. The patient went from being somewhere between level 3 and 4, to being in the lower level 2, called ""low disease activity"", which indicates it's moving towards remission (the lowest level). For someone suffering from this condition, it's a real life changer. For the company selling Enbrel, it's a real market changer. And if it can equally help people with tumors, **Sofusa becomes a major therapeutic factor.** 

I hope investors understand this. **It's another major development in an already extremely promising pipeline** which is currently badly undervalued. If the price doesn't spike today by 10-15%, as it should, just from this news, it would be disappointing. 

But if you are long, today's price change isn't what matters the most. It‚Äôs the understanding that Sorrento / SRNE has ANOTHER ace in its hand!",ngulnq,How Big is SRNE news release about Sofusa success?

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC and its +23% run in the past week. A stock with a massive dividend. A stock trading with a very low P/E of and income growth of 4,200%.

So why is this stock still a buy and hold for me right now?

The CEO is positioning them to increase shareholder value, but also position the company to weather any reduction in the refi market. (65% of the business)

There are major catalysts that have been driving the increase in price that goes beyond the attention gained on WSB.

* Announced **NET earnings of $860M in the first quarter,** with huge margins.
* Reaffirmed a continued dividend, the next ex-dividend date is **6/9/2021**.
* Announced a **$300M stock buyback, representing as much as 40% of the free float** at the current prices.
* Russell index inclusion was missed last quarter due to confusion about their PREVIOUS status as a SPAC. It is expected that they will be reconsidered for Russell Index inclusions in the yearly reconstitution. While not the biggest catalyst, this is a sign of reputation and long-term stability for the stock. **The prelim list publishes 6/4/2021.**
* Creation of a jumbo mortgage product. The average loan origination in the market is \~410,000, indicating that the non-conforming section of the mortgage market is *exploding.* This is a very profitable sector of loan origination.

Other fundamentals driving a buy recommendation:

* Small float. 90M float, of which only about 60M is freely trading.
* This stock is not persistently pressured down quite as hard as others due to low share availability, but it appears based on the last two weeks it's trading the small waves of this stock to try to push it down under dangerous strike prices. A wave of positive sentiment could strangle this position in the stock. I don't have a Bloomberg terminal, but based on the evidence over the last several days, the indication is the 13.1% SI has grown.
* Exceptional open option interest for **tomorrow 5/21/2021.** The options expiring tomorrow have been documented elsewhere so I won't belabor them, but the open interest at the $9, and $10 strike represent almost 10% of the free float.
* Not a new startup, **they have been in this business since 1986**, making them almost as old as a fossil like me. They clearly survived the 2008 storm. This company isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

The cherry:

* **STILL forecasting growth in Q2**, whereas many of its competitors are not.

This post is NOT financial advice, but as someone who has ridden the waves of this stock since it was about $9, I see this position turning positive and the outlook through July for this position has high sentiment. Even if the mortgage market slows down as expected, I will hold these shares for years to come for the dividends and general stability of the organization.

My position 8000 shares @ 7.65 and 45x 6/18 8c. You can go stalk the fuck out of me if you want to see that I've been talking about this stock for some time and been saying the same thing about the strength and targets of their position since March. I am also the guy that tells you when you unintentionally reveal personal info on your yolo screenshots!

TLDR: UWMC should garner close attention for value investors looking for undervalued positions.

5603,,2021-05-20 13:28:43,t3_nh08j4,,wallstreetbets,"**Investment Thesis**

Overall, what makes MDXG a good buying opportunity right now is a combination of two factors.

* Number one is management‚Äôs miscommunication with the market. The market currently believes that wound care is the core business of MDXG, is not entirely aware of the potential of its biopharma pipeline and more specifically its Amniofix drug, and has priced the company based on this.¬†
* Number two is the huge potential of the Amniofix treatment and its ability to become the next blockbuster in the healthcare space after the conclusion of its phase 3 trial.

**Idea Summary**

MiMedx Group *(MDXG)* is a leading BioPharma and wound care business whose value has been drastically misunderstood by the market. Through drivers such as miscommunication from management about the company‚Äôs valued proposition as well as the lack of institutional investor coverage, the market currently believes that the majority of the company‚Äôs value sits in its low growth wound care business. In reality, its major competitive advantage is within its osteoarthritis drug Amniofix which has the potential to become the next blockbuster after it clears phase III clinical trials. A sum of the parts valuation was used to determine a minimum implied upside of at least 300%. Risks are discussed at the end.

**Business Overview**

MiMedx Group is a leading biopharma and advanced wound care business utilizing human placental tissues to develop products used in the healthcare sector. It processes placental tissues using its patented processes to produce allografts, which are tissues transplanted from one person to another for wound care and regeneration. These allografts are effective in healing difficult wounds because of the ability of the allograft cells to quickly associate with the cells of the patient, thereby taking part in the healing process, easing the ability of the body to close the wound, and speeding up the body‚Äôs regeneration process.

MDXG‚Äôs product offerings can be split into two business segments: wound care and biopharma (surgical solutions). Its flagship product Epifix and additional product Epicord fall under its wound care umbrella, and its flagship product Amniofix as well as additional products Amniocord, Amniofill, and Epiburn fall under its biopharma umbrella. The wound care products service the broad wound care industry, targeting specifically chronic wounds. The biopharma product line is more specific, with the flagship treatment Amniofix targeting knee osteoarthritis in specific.¬†

MDXG sells through direct sales, sales agents, and distributors in the United States. This past quarter, 95% of its sales were direct to customers such as healthcare professionals and facilities.¬†

**Internal Analysis**

The past 3 years have not been ideal for MDXG. Its revenues began to dip in 2018 around the time of their accounting scandal, the growth went from 40% in 2018, to 11% in 2019, and is currently around -16%. This sent their stock price tumbling from $16 USD to lows of almost $1 USD, though it is currently trading at $9 with new updates on their biopharma pipeline.

Their gross margin has stayed very high, around 80% while their EBITDA margins have dropped over the years. Though it wasn‚Äôt explicitly disclosed, a large part of this drop in EBITDA margins has been attributed to a temporary increase in legal fees due to the litigation MDXG has faced this past year. Its decreased volume may have also suppressed margins as the number of wound care treatments in hospitals significantly dropped during COVID-19.¬†

The company‚Äôs cash balance is sitting at a very high level of 84 mm. This is in large part due to its recent capital raise, which happened to be strongly criticized by one of MDXG‚Äôs activist investors, Prescience Point Capital (discussed in detail later).

**External Analysis**

*Wound Care Market*

The global wound care market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% from 2021 to 2028. This has been driven by the aging population and rising rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Wound care products are increasingly being used to prevent and surgical site infections.¬†

Though the overall market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% the specific advanced product segment which includes products such as those of MDXG‚Äôs which target chronic and non-healing wounds, is projected to grow much faster than 4.1%.¬†

The wound care market is relatively fragmented, with large players such as Integra LifeSciences, 3M, Johnson & Johnson, and Medtronic competing to gain the most market share. MDXG‚Äôs direct competition for its allograft advanced wound care treatments include Organogenesis, Axogen, Mediwound, and Vericel.¬†

Organogenesis is currently in the lead in this niche market, and while MDXG reported an 11% YoY decline in sales in 2020 (which has already been factored into the current price), Organogenesis reported a 30% increase. This is evident when comparing the stock performance of both companies over the past year (figure 1)

*Osteoarthritis Therapy Market*

91 million U.S. adults have arthritis, 20M have knee OA, and \~32 million per year are currently treated for plantar fasciitis, which is specifically targeted by MDXG‚Äôs Amniofix drug. There are very few FDA approved treatments for knee OA and plantar fasciitis, and those that exist have low efficacy and many drawbacks. Amniofix is currently the only treatment of its nature in phase 3 clinical trials that have posted very positive results in both company and independent trials, has been used off-label by >100K patients with zero severe adverse effects, and consistently demonstrates a significant reduction in pain as reported by patients. In addition, Amniofix has an RMAT (regenerative medicine advanced therapy) designation granted by the FDA which allows for MDXG to benefit from an expedited approval process from the FDA.

*Management Miscommunication*

The current market opinion of MDXG has been blurred by the miscommunication from company management whose goals do not align with maximizing shareholder value. This is largely due to the fact that EW healthcare, a private equity firm, has 33% representation on the board as a result of its 17% stake. From a corporate finance perspective, a private equity firm‚Äôs interests do not generally tend to align with those of public shareholders. Their influence has been exacerbated by the fact that there are no large institutional holdings in MDXG as of yet other than Prescience Point, and there has been minimal coverage on the stock leading to the market‚Äôs opinion on the company being heavily skewed by management communications.¬†

MDXG‚Äôs current growth strategy is focused on roll-ups in the wound care space. This is very characteristic of a private equity playbook, and goes alongside EW‚Äôs historical acquisitions. As was mentioned in the external analysis, the wound care space is growing at a slow rate of \~4.1%, however MDXG has lost significant market share to Organogenesis. Management has failed to realize that the current value driver of the business is within its biopharma line and not its wound care line, yet has continually communicated to shareholders that it believes it is in fact wound care and it is going to continue investing in growing within the industry.

Prescience Point Capital, an activist investor group which has advocated for change in MDXG's communication strategy, has supported the fact that MDXG‚Äôs communications have been focused on the wrong industry. At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, the potential for the drug Amniofix was drastically undersold and much time was spent convincing investors that the core business is in wound care. The 3.6% decline in shares two days after the conference illustrates how effective this strategy was.¬†

There has been strong opposition from MDXG‚Äôs board of directors to Prescience Point‚Äôs activist efforts. In a shareholder letter in early May, prior to their annual meeting, the company communicated that they believe the wound care and regenerative medicine direction being followed now is ideal. They stated that the activist investor does not understand pharmaceutical company disclosure and were advocating for speculative actions themselves though Prescience‚Äôs report discusses the opposite, with them outlining how EW‚Äôs influence on the board of directors is shifting the company‚Äôs focus away from maximizing shareholder value.

*Amniofix*

As mentioned in the external analysis, there is currently no other treatment, either in development or on the market, as effective as Amniofix in treating knee OA and also just as safe. Most recently, at its Q1 earnings call, MDXG CEO shared positive results from the phase IIb prospective trial of the treatment. There was a statistically significant reduction in VAS (visual analog score) for pain and an improvement in the foot function index score. There were also no serious adverse events during this clinical trial. Amniofix is currently in phase III trials, and MDXG believes they are on target to meet all criteria needed to find a biologics license application (BLA) so that the treatment can be introduced to the general public. MDXG is aiming to file their BLA in the first half of 2022, meaning that within a year this blockbuster treatment could be on the market, and given the feedback so far from clinical trials as well as the RMAT designation, it is highly likely.

A Prescience Point market capture analysis estimated that the treatment would bring in $4,050 million of annual sales. This is \~8 times higher than the current sales brought in through wound care. One year ago it would have been prudent to not entirely incorporate this into the share price, however today with clinical trials nearing completion and MDXG‚Äôs new RMAT designation, the likelihood of approval is much higher.

**Valuation**

From a valuation point of view, a quick sum of the parts analysis is the most ideal given the two different business lines of MDXG. A more in-depth DCF can be created once more cost information is provided from MDXG after the conclusion of clinical trials.

Shares outstanding of 109.8 mm, total debt of 51.8 mm, and total cash of 84.7mm were used to convert from enterprise value to equity value. The current implied upside was calculated using the current price of $9.46.

*Wound Care Valuation*

MDXG‚Äôs FY 2021 sales guidance assumed $255 mm to $270 mm in revenue from the wound care segment. Different points in this revenue ranged were used for the low, base, and high cases of the valuation. An EV/Revenue multiple was used to calculate implied enterprise value. The comparables analysis shown in figure 2 illustrated the median multiples derived from the analysis done using the aforementioned list of MDXG‚Äôs competitors. A median multiple of 5.3x was used. The median was used and not marked down because the gross margin and UFCF yield of MDXG is in-line with all competitors. Though the EBIDTA multiple was lower, the similar yield and gross margins indicate that company performance is relatively the same. In addition, litigation expenses factored into the lower EBIDTA multiples and thus it is not indicative of recurring performance.

Based on the revenue multiples, implied share values for the wound care segment range between $12.0 and $12.8.

**Wound Care Equity Value**

**Biopharma Valuation**

Prescience Point estimated annual revenues from Amniofix through using the market capture method. The total market size (annual knee OA injections) was estimated, and a capture percentage was applied to determine the annual number of patients receiving the Amniofix injection. Prescience assumed 1.5 injections per year but to be more conservative in this valuation 1 was used. Price per injection and FDA approval probability varied by the cases and were used to adjust the EV/Rev multiple downwards. Overall, an implied share value range between $25.4 and $57.1 was calculated for this segment.

https://preview.redd.it/we0pw4jm1a071.png?width=611&format=png&auto=webp&s=567d19cc5acc59acbe552a2afcf09789c80866ff

**Biopharma Equity Value**

Overall, the total implied share price ranges between $37.43 to $69.81. As more information regarding Amniofix comes out including the price of manufacturing, different multiples can be used to fine-tune the analysis.

https://preview.redd.it/a8035yfo1a071.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=12e0f9a041e326b505bfda25304261367c651406

**Risks**

1. Given the high influence EW healthcare has on the board of directors, there is potential for more value to describe acquisitions such as that of stability biologics, which was bought for 10 million and sold for 3.5 million 3 years later. If such a trend continues, the value of MDXG‚Äôs wound care business can dramatically decrease, which will hurt the share pierce
2. The FDA approval of Amniofix is a large driver of the valuation calculated. There is a large risk that the FDA will not approve the treatment, however, with the RMAT designation in place and positive results from the first two phases of clinical trials, the odds are strongly in the favour of the approval at the current point in time.

Overall MDXG has been strongly misrepresented by management leading to a skewed opinion and pricing by the market.",nh08j4,$MDXG - Management Miscommunication Skews Valuation Down and Creates Great Buying Opportunity

For those who don't know, $EEM - or the iShares Emerging Markets ETF - is comprised of stocks from developing nations, with a **ton** of room to grow. These countries **will** all catch up soon, it's only a matter of time. This is one of the many reasons I find this setup especially interesting.

Here are the top holdings:

[$EEM Holdings \(By Country\)](https://preview.redd.it/zh7nwb2hfa071.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cb2749a2c7d6c7f548ad89a3f9a746b56d2273)

Next, let's dig into the charts -

Chart 1: **Max Monthly (\~16 Years)**

[$EEM Max Monthly](https://preview.redd.it/ylknrqzhea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=91ee9718b89c47744e6f68224a133c48c7bcfc6f)

Here you can see we have a **symmetrical triangle** pattern that dates back to late 2007. In technical analysis, the longer the pattern has been building, the more significant the breakout will be. Subsequently - you can imagine the magnitude a pattern like this has.

When making new all time highs I like to look for psychological resistances. As a result - logical targets for this pattern are **75.00, 100.00.** Sounds simple, but it works in practice. Keep in mind - something like this will take **3 - 5 years** to play out. This is a position trade.

In order for this breakout to stay valid - we need to continue getting monthly closes above **50.85.** You can see we've pretty much gone perfectly sideways since breaking out for **4 months** now.

This is **bullish -** moving sideways in a higher range is always biased to the upside (except in special situations with certain reversal patterns). Not only that, but we've been forming an interesting setup on the next chart I will show you all -

Chart 2: **1 Year 1 Day**

[$EEM 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/7hy7wbqeea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8102c5b1f0e92c02260cfccc6b8d77eafea8035d)

On this chart - you can make much more sense of those 4 months of sideways. We are actually working on a large **falling wedge** \- which is a bullish continuation pattern. The breakout point for this is sitting around **54.37** as I am writing this (5/20/2021).

Upon breaking this (ignoring the previous chart) - we would target **54.94, 56.49, 57.32, 60.00, 65.00.** That would be if there was no setup on the monthly chart. Each of these are resistances we could stop and consolidate at. I like to scale in after breaking each resistance. Scale into winners and cut losers fast. A break from a pattern like this would probably take **3 - 6 months** to play out.

I also want to note that **MASSIVE** increase in volume on 3/26. Generally - an uptick on volume when price is doing what you want it to is always a plus. But one like that is very intriguing - on a huge green candle too. My guess would be someone loaded their bags there (or a group of players).

And... **that's it.** Keep it simple. Those are often the best setups.

***TL;DR -***

$EEM has a big pattern - broke out 4 months ago just chopping sideways waiting for the move to happen.

Price targets **75.00, 100.00**

Stop out below **50.87** monthly close

Timeframe **3-5 years**

It also has a smaller pattern above that one - which breaks out above **54.37** and has a shorter time horizon.

Price targets **60.00, 65.00**

Stop out if we close back inside

Timeframe **3-6 months**

***Positions -***

\- Research coming out of John Hopkins University is suggesting that the use of Psilocybin is the most effective drug ever tested as a remedy for depression, anxiety, and PTSD. As the United States is currently under crisis in its battle against mental illness, these results are too impressive to ignore, even if it may need to overcome pressures from big pharma interest groups that seek to quell the expansion of this research.

\- These drugs have been extremely effective in treating addiction -- particularly alcohol and nicotine. Considering the government expenditure on the opioid crisis, once this proves to be an effective treatment, the government will expedite the medicinal legalization of the substances that MNMD has been treating/experimenting with.

\- Veterans, the most respected occupational category (statistically,) have begun launching advocacy groups for the widespread medicinal legalization of these substances due to their effectiveness against PTSD. These therapeutic measures have contributed to the plummeting of suicide rates (those treated w/ psilocybin vs. control group.) The Biden administration will have to choose ethics and reason over the suffering of veterans (former government employees) which I anticipate that they will given mounting pressure due to the effectiveness of these treatments.

Does this hinge on expected earnings in the long-run ... certainly!

But the effectiveness of this research is undeniable and can no longer be overlooked ... because of new cultural acceptance of these alternative treatments the government's hand will be forced in legalize, or otherwise be responsible for mental illness and addiction -- all of which could be treated and cured.

If you aren't familiar with the efficient frontier, what it tries to find is the *mean-variance portfolio.* This type of model deals with portfolio management / optimization. In terms of the efficient frontier you are trying to find the best portfolio allocation weights that give you the best risk adjusted returns. 

**In simple words:** you give it stocks and it tells you the best percentage holdings

I recently built an app on some python code that does this sort of optimization. There is no programming required to use the app. When running the app it will give two portfolios, minimum variance, and maximized sharpe (same as mean-variance, mean-markowitz). Minimum variance will tell you the least riskiest holding strategy (green), and max sharpe will give you the best reward-for-risk holding (red). I call that portfolio *the-juice-is-worth-the-squeeze.* Here is a sample output.

I used around 100,000 simulations, and 10Y of adjusted close data. 

The reason why I bring this up is because it does two things. The first is that it promotes portfolio diversification, which I know is pretty uncommon here. Also it finds the most aggressive returns in terms of minimizing risk. If you have high returns and wonder why you returns are so much higher than standard investment funds its probably because you are here

How high could it go? Well If we take a look at the graph below, we can see that SPCE peaked at around 60 bucks  back in February in ANTICIPATION for the previous test flight which was delayed until May for safety reasons (They had some problems with electromagnetic interference which is fixed now).

Currently the price is around 18-19 bucks, so it's an absolute steal in my opinion, but there is always the risk that some shit fucks up and the test flight is delayed even further, in which case I will have to sell the house.

#Topics of discussion:

* Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks

* WDC Fundamentals

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

\*\*\*My average in @ $5.10, currently at $5.52, May 20th, 2021

I am not investing in the company as a get-rich-quick scheme, but plan to hold long term. **Saphyr** technology will continue to improve directly with design improvements, but also indirectly with the data that it continuously collects will create more accurate correlations of DNA with individual predispositions for disease. 

I believe the technology will allow for a more personal approach in the field of medicine, and should not be viewed solely as a research-based company.  

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community. 

* **Large institutional investments have nearly tripled (3X) from 5% to 14%.** 
* **Earnings beat expectations in Q1 2021.**
* **Recent large insider procurement.**
* **New patents, research breakthroughs, Large Lab facility adoption.**

This is why I have a strong conviction for **Bionano Genomics (BNGO)** being a great growth stock to investigate and follow. 

There are some negative indicators fundamentally, but considering Bionano is still in its infancy I am very optimistic in my outlook. The positives tip the scale in my opinion and at the very least, Bianano Genomics (BNGO) should be on your watchlist!

https://preview.redd.it/75whflg7mb071.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=82973b55ed2361257a6a495dba64b459b064fa98

Lets have a good laugh and some good feelings of how successful we apes are winning every battle stated by the meme.

**Part 1: Technical Analysis**

[RSI and Price Action Analysis](https://preview.redd.it/c07myb4cmb071.png?width=1867&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b3ad763c91f67d874eb8c15e03225a8089f519c)

Let's continue on. You may be asking... Why is this trend so bullish? As you can see on these 1h charts above and below with their RSI and the price action over the last 4 weeks or so, you notice a pattern forming. The RSI has been steadily trending down while the price goes up. We are seeing higher-lows, higher-lows, and higher-lows, what does this mean? AMC approaching increasingly oversold territory even as the price continues to rise and stay above the $12.223 support line. THIS LITERALLY CANNOT GET ANY MORE BULLISH THAN IT ALREADY IS!!

*Processing img xev2x0vhmb071...*

[Comprehensive Technical Analysis](https://preview.redd.it/j4jkbaflmb071.png?width=1867&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba175a4c2e12f2eda76ce23aba980a068b77be57)

What could happen today? Either we start trending up from yesterday and test or break the $14.54 resistance. Or, we slightly trend down, hit that $12.223 support level, become too oversold on RSI and KDJ, experience a MACD golden cross, then BOUNCE THE LIVING HELL back to the $13 or $14.54 range, then test or break that $14.54 range and establish that as the new support, then easily blow through $18.00, and eventually through $23.024, and $28.80; establishing those former resistance lines as supports along the way. If we get a volume and price spike from institutional buyers, shorts covering, or FOMO kicking in, we may very likely trigger a short squeeze and force the hedgies to buy back their short positions at higher and higher prices, leading to a MASSIVE increase in price.

[**Part 2: Days To Cover/Short Interest**](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/short-interest/)

*Processing img xe04spwrmb071...*

Looking at the Average Volume (TianVol). You can see that from Early-February through now, the average volume has been hovering around 445.72M per day. With the total countable shorted stocks around 93,890,000.

445720000 / 93890000 = 4.74725742891

Running the calculation, we can determine that, with the data gathered, it is going to take short sellers \~4.75 days to completely cover their shorts once the squeeze starts. This squeeze is going to last \~8 times longer than the baby squeeze we had in January, which lasted only \~22 hours with the days to cover being \~0.9 days with January's short count and average volume.

[**Part 3: Institutional Buy-ins**](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/institutional-ownership/)

Looking at the data seen on the MarketBeat site, we can see a huge influx of institutional buy-ins. Going on the site, you can see that institutions have bought 359 million shares in the first quarter of 2021 and only 13 million have sold. **THAT'S A 97.5% BUY RATE BY INSTITUTIONS.** HOW CAN'T IT GET MORE BULLISH THAN THIS! Hedge Funds like Nuveen Asset Management LLC, and AQR Capital Management LLC, have gone long; BUYING LOTS OF SHARES THIS MONTH.

**Part 4: Conclusion**

What does this mean for all of us. With institutions and a couple hedge funds (not including CITADEL) choosing the right side of the game, things are looking up for a squeezy future. If we continue to buy and HODL for dear life, we can smash CITADEL and Melvin Capital to the ground. I say it again loudly, BUY AND HODL FOR DEAR LIFE AND DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT SELLING EVEN A SINGLE SHARE UNTIL AFTER THE PEAK, WE ARE COLLECTIVELY STRONGER THAN THESE HEDGIES!

I'm planning to continue doing weekly relative rotation analysis of the market, but wanted to create this mid week post to take a quick look at UWMC. Please let me know if another flair is more appropriate.

I'm not going to get into the financials, since plenty of solid DD has been done on that already. However, I did mention in my last post (analyzing the market sectors) that I would look into positions related to the real estate sector (XLRE).

My thought process here it to take a look at the short term momentum for this stock due to the recent positive earnings, great financials, positive future outlook, and upcoming June Ex-Div date.

Lets jump into it and make it quick...

Since there is a lot of talk regarding Russell inclusion, here is the RRG of UWMC again UWM:

[Looks like we have strong short term momentum when compared to the Russell 2000](https://preview.redd.it/4jlcf06t74071.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=aaf27b245685d1ecf8e0d0d5937216f3d1ef719d)

Now for SPY:

Finally, XLRE:

[No surprise. Similar to SPY](https://preview.redd.it/azj0le6i84071.png?width=893&format=png&auto=webp&s=84491c3d259a601a72339f9a7f53a7dc1078e3a1)

**My Thoughts:**

Personally, the company has strong fundamentals. So, in combination with the momentum, I think its a decent ""buy"" (this is not professional financial advice).

I'm playing this 3 ways:

6/18 short put x 2 @ $7

7/16 long call x 5 @ $6

1100 shares @ $8.06

Edit 1: Silly me, I forgot to mention that a share buyback plan was approved which also contributes to the positive momentum.

**TL;DR: UWMC looks good. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ**",ngckdk,UWMC: Relative Rotation

From the minute I heard the interview I realized that this person had no clue what she was talking about. To the credit of the Podcast hosts they mentioned that ARKK would have issues with outflows leading to lower stock prices in a later Podcast, which they have. I should have shorted it, but I'm not rich. Here are some of her stances:

&#x200B;

She predicts CoinBit $500,000.

She is all-in on Tesla.

She thinks gene editing is a sound investment at this time.

She has decreased her position in Netflix.

&#x200B;

I think that the increase size of her fund will continue to limit her ability to invest in anything interesting. The longshots in her portfolio which have had massive success are often successful because her fund's investment has massively increased their market cap.  She has also tied herself so tightly to Tesla that she can never hop off that ride. She's tied to the autopilot whether it goes to the moon or into a tree. I'm not denying that she has had good results during this bull market, but I think a fund that goes the other direction will do very well over the next 5 years.

What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either. 

Here is some better and more thought out DD:

6129,,2021-05-19 20:14:45,t3_ngftx1,,wallstreetbets,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",ngftx1,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Mr. Cramer..."

Big tech's earnings absolutely destroyed estimates but sell side thinks it's due to lock down and people will rely on tech less once things open up. It's a consistent pattern that all the gains made after earning erode overnight or in a few trading session as if the good earning did not happen.

6132,,2021-05-19 20:51:00,t3_nggpql,,wallstreetbets,"I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

6134,,2021-05-19 21:25:26,t3_nghmhm,,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",nghmhm,$NUE is strong as steel. Buy the dips.

Petco earnings is tomorrow pre-market. But this also might be a potential candidate for a short squeeze.

Short sellers are gearing up for a bad quarter. For the last three days, the short float increased from 4 point-something Monday, 6.05 yesterday, and today it's at 8.75.

In addition, short interest is up to 35.2%

To top it off, there are hardly any shares available to short, though borrowing rate remains at only 1%. For the last five days there were no more than 100k shares left to short.

The average price target is $28, but if earnings goes better than expected, this could be the catalyst for something significantly bigger. Listen to your pets' beckoning calls, and keep this on your watch list!

Two major catalysts are on the near horizon:

1) Earnings report on 5/24 AH: Confirmation of late Q3 production and disclosure of binding orders have a high probability of being announced.

2) Lordstown Week (June 21-25): Plant open house for tours, test drives, etc., and above all else, transparency.  This should alone should put the final nail in the shorts coffin.

6146,,2021-05-20 05:24:49,t3_ngrqqf,,wallstreetbets,"Some context: Cell carriers in the US have decided to stop the function of shared short codes (5-6 digit phone numbers) June 1. Shared short codes were the preferred means of SMS and MMS communication for B2C traffic. Short codes were free to lease in many cases, text messages were cheap, thousands of businesses could send from the same number, and throughput was incredibly high (lots of messages could be sent very fast).

The new policy enforced by the CTIA (The private club all major cell phone carriers are in) is that shared short codes are to be discontinued and replaced by dedicated short codes and A2P 10dlc (approved B2C traffic on 10-digit phone numbers). This means that every business/organization that wants to send texts must either apply for a dedicated short code or apply for a 10DLC. 

Dedicated short codes are the preferred choice for large corporations. They can handle large throughput and look good for the brand. However, they only cater to large corporations because they are thousands of dollars/year to lease. Turn around time for application is 4-6 weeks. Barrier to entry is high.

10DLC is the preferred choice for the smaller businesses since it's less expensive. But, it is still far more expensive than the shared short codes businesses are used to, requires application, and costs $50/mo in carrier and registration fees alone. Turn around time for application is less than a week. On top of fees, 10dlc isn't even fully ready. The Campaign Registry, the organization responsible for rolling out ""the new messaging standard"" for the CTIA, is still developing their API.

Enter Toll-free messaging. TF has 0 barrier to entry and can be issued to a business with SMS and MMS capabilities in seconds. It's the easiest and now the most cost-effective way to send commercial messages.

Conveniently, every major carrier announced this month (for the first time) that they will start collecting a $0.0025/message fee for every sms sent. They're ready for and expecting businesses to move to this method.

Who is Zipwhip: Zipwhip was given full reign over all TF traffic. Anyone in the US  that wants to send messages on TF codes uses Zipwhip in one way or another. They are a massive reseller that everyone is required to go through.

It was recently announced the Twilio plans on acquiring Zipwhip for $850M. Twilio is the leader is programmable messaging hands down. 

Honestly, there should be antitrust issues that arise and block the acquisition. If it goes through, Twilio owns the new world of business sms. Good chance regulators won't notice any issue. They'll miss the fact that businesses will be pressured into TF over their preferred solutions (dedicated short codes and A2P 10DLC) since it's unnecessarily complicated and expensive. TF is ready now and cheap.

TL;DR if Twilio successfully acquires Zipwhip, every small to medium sized business that wants to send texts will have to go through them. Every single one of them in the US.",ngrqqf,$TWLO stands to be the primary source for commercial text messaging

6149,,2021-05-20 08:25:07,t3_ngulnq,,wallstreetbets,"So just how big is **today's news about the initial success of the Sofusa technology**?

1st, this is a technology that aims at lymphatic delivery. 

**What does this mean?** Well, when trying to fight a disease, it's difficult to target the lymphatic system. Because of how it works and the fact that it is spread throughout our body. 

So there are MANY, MANY drugs out there that treat several conditions through the lymphatic system. But, because of what we just explained, those drugs sometimes don't work. They are not properly ""delivered"". They don't get to where they need to get to make the necessary interaction and solve the problem.

**Sorrento has developed a technology that can deliver drugs to where they actually need to go** in the lymphatic system. So this is definitely breakthrough technology. Other companies are aiming to find similar solutions. But we are definitely talking about very advanced bio-tech.

In this case, we have a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. This is a condition that worsens with time. It's very painful and limits the patient's movement. It's not very common, so we are talking about 1.5 million people in the USA and about 30 million worldwide. 

But remember, **the technology Sorrento is developing  will be able to deliver drugs treating many other diseases** related to the lymphatic system. So the market for Sofusa is very, very large.

The press release tells us Sofusa was tested on ""First Enbrel-Non-Responding"" patients. 

**What does this mean?** Patients who need the drug Enbrel and, even though they have not been taking the drug for long (it's a ""first"" for them) they are not responding to it. It isn't helping them. 

Now, Sofusa comes into play. It's job is to deliver Enbrel to the patient effectively. To ""take"" Enbrel to where it needs to go in the lymphatic system.. 

The 1st obvious advantage is that the drug wasn't helping and now helps. But there are other important advantages.

Since the drug is being carried to its targeted ""destination"" the dosage needed, diminishes. Because less is ""lost along the way"". This is important because many diseases related to the lymphatic system, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are chronic, lifelong conditions. Being able to administer less drugs really helps the patient. Now you have a drug that actually works, more potently, which reduces its dosage. All this thanks to Sorrento.

The press release points out an important factor: This is a trial on ONE type of drug/treatment. Other such trials testing the effectiveness of Sofusa are already taking place. Again, this is proof of the potentially huge market for this delivery system.

Just to get an idea, the release mentions anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. These are a type of drugs that inhibit the activity of certain proteins (they inhibit PD1 and CTLA4, which are types of proteins. By stopping their activity, they help in stopping the growth of cancer tumors). There are several drugs that fall under these categories and treat a wide variety of cancers. **Sofusa can potentially play a vital role in all these treatments**. 

This is like several companies developing apps while Sorrento is developing a new smartphone technology. Each app has its rightful use and market. But once the new smartphone is up and working, all apps will need it. So this technology has huge revenue implications. T**he fact we are hearing good news about it is HUGE**.

As for the results themselves: **The DAS28 test measures rheumatoid activity in 28 joints** in the patient's body. The joints might be swollen or tender (hurting).

This patient had a DAS28 score of 4.6, with 18 out of 28 joints compromised.  That is considered  moderate to high disease activity.  There are 4 levels of DAS 28 scores going from remission (the best) to high (the worst). So this patient was not in the worst shape going in, but pretty bad.

Using Sofusa to deliver the Enbrel drug, in just 4 weeks (this is a very short time for this type of disease!!) the results went from 4.6 to 3.0. The total amount of compromised joints, from 18 to 11. **That is a dramatic change**. The patient went from being somewhere between level 3 and 4, to being in the lower level 2, called ""low disease activity"", which indicates it's moving towards remission (the lowest level). For someone suffering from this condition, it's a real life changer. For the company selling Enbrel, it's a real market changer. And if it can equally help people with tumors, **Sofusa becomes a major therapeutic factor.** 

I hope investors understand this. **It's another major development in an already extremely promising pipeline** which is currently badly undervalued. If the price doesn't spike today by 10-15%, as it should, just from this news, it would be disappointing. 

But if you are long, today's price change isn't what matters the most. It‚Äôs the understanding that Sorrento / SRNE has ANOTHER ace in its hand!",ngulnq,How Big is SRNE news release about Sofusa success?

* Announced a **$300M stock buyback, representing as much as 40% of the free float** at the current prices.
* Russell index inclusion was missed last quarter due to confusion about their PREVIOUS status as a SPAC. It is expected that they will be reconsidered for Russell Index inclusions in the yearly reconstitution. While not the biggest catalyst, this is a sign of reputation and long-term stability for the stock. **The prelim list publishes 6/4/2021.**
* Creation of a jumbo mortgage product. The average loan origination in the market is \~410,000, indicating that the non-conforming section of the mortgage market is *exploding.* This is a very profitable sector of loan origination.

Other fundamentals driving a buy recommendation:

* Small float. 90M float, of which only about 60M is freely trading.
* This stock is not persistently pressured down quite as hard as others due to low share availability, but it appears based on the last two weeks it's trading the small waves of this stock to try to push it down under dangerous strike prices. A wave of positive sentiment could strangle this position in the stock. I don't have a Bloomberg terminal, but based on the evidence over the last several days, the indication is the 13.1% SI has grown.
* Exceptional open option interest for **tomorrow 5/21/2021.** The options expiring tomorrow have been documented elsewhere so I won't belabor them, but the open interest at the $9, and $10 strike represent almost 10% of the free float.
* Not a new startup, **they have been in this business since 1986**, making them almost as old as a fossil like me. They clearly survived the 2008 storm. This company isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

The cherry:

* **STILL forecasting growth in Q2**, whereas many of its competitors are not.

This post is NOT financial advice, but as someone who has ridden the waves of this stock since it was about $9, I see this position turning positive and the outlook through July for this position has high sentiment. Even if the mortgage market slows down as expected, I will hold these shares for years to come for the dividends and general stability of the organization.

My position 8000 shares @ 7.65 and 45x 6/18 8c. You can go stalk the fuck out of me if you want to see that I've been talking about this stock for some time and been saying the same thing about the strength and targets of their position since March. I am also the guy that tells you when you unintentionally reveal personal info on your yolo screenshots!

6160,,2021-05-20 13:28:43,t3_nh08j4,,wallstreetbets,"**Investment Thesis**

Overall, what makes MDXG a good buying opportunity right now is a combination of two factors.

* Number one is management‚Äôs miscommunication with the market. The market currently believes that wound care is the core business of MDXG, is not entirely aware of the potential of its biopharma pipeline and more specifically its Amniofix drug, and has priced the company based on this.¬†
* Number two is the huge potential of the Amniofix treatment and its ability to become the next blockbuster in the healthcare space after the conclusion of its phase 3 trial.

**Idea Summary**

MiMedx Group *(MDXG)* is a leading BioPharma and wound care business whose value has been drastically misunderstood by the market. Through drivers such as miscommunication from management about the company‚Äôs valued proposition as well as the lack of institutional investor coverage, the market currently believes that the majority of the company‚Äôs value sits in its low growth wound care business. In reality, its major competitive advantage is within its osteoarthritis drug Amniofix which has the potential to become the next blockbuster after it clears phase III clinical trials. A sum of the parts valuation was used to determine a minimum implied upside of at least 300%. Risks are discussed at the end.

**Business Overview**

MiMedx Group is a leading biopharma and advanced wound care business utilizing human placental tissues to develop products used in the healthcare sector. It processes placental tissues using its patented processes to produce allografts, which are tissues transplanted from one person to another for wound care and regeneration. These allografts are effective in healing difficult wounds because of the ability of the allograft cells to quickly associate with the cells of the patient, thereby taking part in the healing process, easing the ability of the body to close the wound, and speeding up the body‚Äôs regeneration process.

MDXG‚Äôs product offerings can be split into two business segments: wound care and biopharma (surgical solutions). Its flagship product Epifix and additional product Epicord fall under its wound care umbrella, and its flagship product Amniofix as well as additional products Amniocord, Amniofill, and Epiburn fall under its biopharma umbrella. The wound care products service the broad wound care industry, targeting specifically chronic wounds. The biopharma product line is more specific, with the flagship treatment Amniofix targeting knee osteoarthritis in specific.¬†

MDXG sells through direct sales, sales agents, and distributors in the United States. This past quarter, 95% of its sales were direct to customers such as healthcare professionals and facilities.¬†

**Internal Analysis**

The past 3 years have not been ideal for MDXG. Its revenues began to dip in 2018 around the time of their accounting scandal, the growth went from 40% in 2018, to 11% in 2019, and is currently around -16%. This sent their stock price tumbling from $16 USD to lows of almost $1 USD, though it is currently trading at $9 with new updates on their biopharma pipeline.

Their gross margin has stayed very high, around 80% while their EBITDA margins have dropped over the years. Though it wasn‚Äôt explicitly disclosed, a large part of this drop in EBITDA margins has been attributed to a temporary increase in legal fees due to the litigation MDXG has faced this past year. Its decreased volume may have also suppressed margins as the number of wound care treatments in hospitals significantly dropped during COVID-19.¬†

The company‚Äôs cash balance is sitting at a very high level of 84 mm. This is in large part due to its recent capital raise, which happened to be strongly criticized by one of MDXG‚Äôs activist investors, Prescience Point Capital (discussed in detail later).

**External Analysis**

*Wound Care Market*

The global wound care market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% from 2021 to 2028. This has been driven by the aging population and rising rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Wound care products are increasingly being used to prevent and surgical site infections.¬†

Though the overall market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% the specific advanced product segment which includes products such as those of MDXG‚Äôs which target chronic and non-healing wounds, is projected to grow much faster than 4.1%.¬†

The wound care market is relatively fragmented, with large players such as Integra LifeSciences, 3M, Johnson & Johnson, and Medtronic competing to gain the most market share. MDXG‚Äôs direct competition for its allograft advanced wound care treatments include Organogenesis, Axogen, Mediwound, and Vericel.¬†

Organogenesis is currently in the lead in this niche market, and while MDXG reported an 11% YoY decline in sales in 2020 (which has already been factored into the current price), Organogenesis reported a 30% increase. This is evident when comparing the stock performance of both companies over the past year (figure 1)

*Osteoarthritis Therapy Market*

91 million U.S. adults have arthritis, 20M have knee OA, and \~32 million per year are currently treated for plantar fasciitis, which is specifically targeted by MDXG‚Äôs Amniofix drug. There are very few FDA approved treatments for knee OA and plantar fasciitis, and those that exist have low efficacy and many drawbacks. Amniofix is currently the only treatment of its nature in phase 3 clinical trials that have posted very positive results in both company and independent trials, has been used off-label by >100K patients with zero severe adverse effects, and consistently demonstrates a significant reduction in pain as reported by patients. In addition, Amniofix has an RMAT (regenerative medicine advanced therapy) designation granted by the FDA which allows for MDXG to benefit from an expedited approval process from the FDA.

*Management Miscommunication*

The current market opinion of MDXG has been blurred by the miscommunication from company management whose goals do not align with maximizing shareholder value. This is largely due to the fact that EW healthcare, a private equity firm, has 33% representation on the board as a result of its 17% stake. From a corporate finance perspective, a private equity firm‚Äôs interests do not generally tend to align with those of public shareholders. Their influence has been exacerbated by the fact that there are no large institutional holdings in MDXG as of yet other than Prescience Point, and there has been minimal coverage on the stock leading to the market‚Äôs opinion on the company being heavily skewed by management communications.¬†

MDXG‚Äôs current growth strategy is focused on roll-ups in the wound care space. This is very characteristic of a private equity playbook, and goes alongside EW‚Äôs historical acquisitions. As was mentioned in the external analysis, the wound care space is growing at a slow rate of \~4.1%, however MDXG has lost significant market share to Organogenesis. Management has failed to realize that the current value driver of the business is within its biopharma line and not its wound care line, yet has continually communicated to shareholders that it believes it is in fact wound care and it is going to continue investing in growing within the industry.

Prescience Point Capital, an activist investor group which has advocated for change in MDXG's communication strategy, has supported the fact that MDXG‚Äôs communications have been focused on the wrong industry. At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, the potential for the drug Amniofix was drastically undersold and much time was spent convincing investors that the core business is in wound care. The 3.6% decline in shares two days after the conference illustrates how effective this strategy was.¬†

There has been strong opposition from MDXG‚Äôs board of directors to Prescience Point‚Äôs activist efforts. In a shareholder letter in early May, prior to their annual meeting, the company communicated that they believe the wound care and regenerative medicine direction being followed now is ideal. They stated that the activist investor does not understand pharmaceutical company disclosure and were advocating for speculative actions themselves though Prescience‚Äôs report discusses the opposite, with them outlining how EW‚Äôs influence on the board of directors is shifting the company‚Äôs focus away from maximizing shareholder value.

*Amniofix*

As mentioned in the external analysis, there is currently no other treatment, either in development or on the market, as effective as Amniofix in treating knee OA and also just as safe. Most recently, at its Q1 earnings call, MDXG CEO shared positive results from the phase IIb prospective trial of the treatment. There was a statistically significant reduction in VAS (visual analog score) for pain and an improvement in the foot function index score. There were also no serious adverse events during this clinical trial. Amniofix is currently in phase III trials, and MDXG believes they are on target to meet all criteria needed to find a biologics license application (BLA) so that the treatment can be introduced to the general public. MDXG is aiming to file their BLA in the first half of 2022, meaning that within a year this blockbuster treatment could be on the market, and given the feedback so far from clinical trials as well as the RMAT designation, it is highly likely.

A Prescience Point market capture analysis estimated that the treatment would bring in $4,050 million of annual sales. This is \~8 times higher than the current sales brought in through wound care. One year ago it would have been prudent to not entirely incorporate this into the share price, however today with clinical trials nearing completion and MDXG‚Äôs new RMAT designation, the likelihood of approval is much higher.

**Valuation**

From a valuation point of view, a quick sum of the parts analysis is the most ideal given the two different business lines of MDXG. A more in-depth DCF can be created once more cost information is provided from MDXG after the conclusion of clinical trials.

Shares outstanding of 109.8 mm, total debt of 51.8 mm, and total cash of 84.7mm were used to convert from enterprise value to equity value. The current implied upside was calculated using the current price of $9.46.

*Wound Care Valuation*

MDXG‚Äôs FY 2021 sales guidance assumed $255 mm to $270 mm in revenue from the wound care segment. Different points in this revenue ranged were used for the low, base, and high cases of the valuation. An EV/Revenue multiple was used to calculate implied enterprise value. The comparables analysis shown in figure 2 illustrated the median multiples derived from the analysis done using the aforementioned list of MDXG‚Äôs competitors. A median multiple of 5.3x was used. The median was used and not marked down because the gross margin and UFCF yield of MDXG is in-line with all competitors. Though the EBIDTA multiple was lower, the similar yield and gross margins indicate that company performance is relatively the same. In addition, litigation expenses factored into the lower EBIDTA multiples and thus it is not indicative of recurring performance.

Based on the revenue multiples, implied share values for the wound care segment range between $12.0 and $12.8.

**Wound Care Equity Value**

**Biopharma Valuation**

Prescience Point estimated annual revenues from Amniofix through using the market capture method. The total market size (annual knee OA injections) was estimated, and a capture percentage was applied to determine the annual number of patients receiving the Amniofix injection. Prescience assumed 1.5 injections per year but to be more conservative in this valuation 1 was used. Price per injection and FDA approval probability varied by the cases and were used to adjust the EV/Rev multiple downwards. Overall, an implied share value range between $25.4 and $57.1 was calculated for this segment.

https://preview.redd.it/we0pw4jm1a071.png?width=611&format=png&auto=webp&s=567d19cc5acc59acbe552a2afcf09789c80866ff

**Biopharma Equity Value**

Overall, the total implied share price ranges between $37.43 to $69.81. As more information regarding Amniofix comes out including the price of manufacturing, different multiples can be used to fine-tune the analysis.

https://preview.redd.it/a8035yfo1a071.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=12e0f9a041e326b505bfda25304261367c651406

**Risks**

1. Given the high influence EW healthcare has on the board of directors, there is potential for more value to describe acquisitions such as that of stability biologics, which was bought for 10 million and sold for 3.5 million 3 years later. If such a trend continues, the value of MDXG‚Äôs wound care business can dramatically decrease, which will hurt the share pierce
2. The FDA approval of Amniofix is a large driver of the valuation calculated. There is a large risk that the FDA will not approve the treatment, however, with the RMAT designation in place and positive results from the first two phases of clinical trials, the odds are strongly in the favour of the approval at the current point in time.

For those who don't know, $EEM - or the iShares Emerging Markets ETF - is comprised of stocks from developing nations, with a **ton** of room to grow. These countries **will** all catch up soon, it's only a matter of time. This is one of the many reasons I find this setup especially interesting.

Here are the top holdings:

[$EEM Holdings \(By Country\)](https://preview.redd.it/zh7nwb2hfa071.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cb2749a2c7d6c7f548ad89a3f9a746b56d2273)

Next, let's dig into the charts -

Chart 1: **Max Monthly (\~16 Years)**

[$EEM Max Monthly](https://preview.redd.it/ylknrqzhea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=91ee9718b89c47744e6f68224a133c48c7bcfc6f)

Here you can see we have a **symmetrical triangle** pattern that dates back to late 2007. In technical analysis, the longer the pattern has been building, the more significant the breakout will be. Subsequently - you can imagine the magnitude a pattern like this has.

When making new all time highs I like to look for psychological resistances. As a result - logical targets for this pattern are **75.00, 100.00.** Sounds simple, but it works in practice. Keep in mind - something like this will take **3 - 5 years** to play out. This is a position trade.

In order for this breakout to stay valid - we need to continue getting monthly closes above **50.85.** You can see we've pretty much gone perfectly sideways since breaking out for **4 months** now.

This is **bullish -** moving sideways in a higher range is always biased to the upside (except in special situations with certain reversal patterns). Not only that, but we've been forming an interesting setup on the next chart I will show you all -

Chart 2: **1 Year 1 Day**

[$EEM 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/7hy7wbqeea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8102c5b1f0e92c02260cfccc6b8d77eafea8035d)

On this chart - you can make much more sense of those 4 months of sideways. We are actually working on a large **falling wedge** \- which is a bullish continuation pattern. The breakout point for this is sitting around **54.37** as I am writing this (5/20/2021).

Upon breaking this (ignoring the previous chart) - we would target **54.94, 56.49, 57.32, 60.00, 65.00.** That would be if there was no setup on the monthly chart. Each of these are resistances we could stop and consolidate at. I like to scale in after breaking each resistance. Scale into winners and cut losers fast. A break from a pattern like this would probably take **3 - 6 months** to play out.

I also want to note that **MASSIVE** increase in volume on 3/26. Generally - an uptick on volume when price is doing what you want it to is always a plus. But one like that is very intriguing - on a huge green candle too. My guess would be someone loaded their bags there (or a group of players).

And... **that's it.** Keep it simple. Those are often the best setups.

***TL;DR -***

$EEM has a big pattern - broke out 4 months ago just chopping sideways waiting for the move to happen.

Price targets **75.00, 100.00**

Stop out below **50.87** monthly close

Timeframe **3-5 years**

It also has a smaller pattern above that one - which breaks out above **54.37** and has a shorter time horizon.

Price targets **60.00, 65.00**

Stop out if we close back inside

Timeframe **3-6 months**

***Positions -***

10% of my long term portfolio is in emerging markets ETFs and,

August **55c @ 0.91** \- Will always roll these back before they get below 60 DTE - Will scale in heavily after the smaller pattern breaks out

\- Research coming out of John Hopkins University is suggesting that the use of Psilocybin is the most effective drug ever tested as a remedy for depression, anxiety, and PTSD. As the United States is currently under crisis in its battle against mental illness, these results are too impressive to ignore, even if it may need to overcome pressures from big pharma interest groups that seek to quell the expansion of this research.

\- These drugs have been extremely effective in treating addiction -- particularly alcohol and nicotine. Considering the government expenditure on the opioid crisis, once this proves to be an effective treatment, the government will expedite the medicinal legalization of the substances that MNMD has been treating/experimenting with.

\- Veterans, the most respected occupational category (statistically,) have begun launching advocacy groups for the widespread medicinal legalization of these substances due to their effectiveness against PTSD. These therapeutic measures have contributed to the plummeting of suicide rates (those treated w/ psilocybin vs. control group.) The Biden administration will have to choose ethics and reason over the suffering of veterans (former government employees) which I anticipate that they will given mounting pressure due to the effectiveness of these treatments.

&#x200B;

Does this hinge on expected earnings in the long-run ... certainly!

&#x200B;

But the effectiveness of this research is undeniable and can no longer be overlooked ... because of new cultural acceptance of these alternative treatments the government's hand will be forced in legalize, or otherwise be responsible for mental illness and addiction -- all of which could be treated and cured.

6170,,2021-05-20 16:06:53,t3_nh45af,,wallstreetbets,"I want to first start off by saying that I'm not liable for financial losses. I recently built an app that can generate efficient frontiers when you plug in individual US Equities. 

If you aren't familiar with the efficient frontier, what it tries to find is the *mean-variance portfolio.* This type of model deals with portfolio management / optimization. In terms of the efficient frontier you are trying to find the best portfolio allocation weights that give you the best risk adjusted returns. 

**In simple words:** you give it stocks and it tells you the best percentage holdings

I recently built an app on some python code that does this sort of optimization. There is no programming required to use the app. When running the app it will give two portfolios, minimum variance, and maximized sharpe (same as mean-variance, mean-markowitz). Minimum variance will tell you the least riskiest holding strategy (green), and max sharpe will give you the best reward-for-risk holding (red). I call that portfolio *the-juice-is-worth-the-squeeze.* Here is a sample output.

I used around 100,000 simulations, and 10Y of adjusted close data. 

The reason why I bring this up is because it does two things. The first is that it promotes portfolio diversification, which I know is pretty uncommon here. Also it finds the most aggressive returns in terms of minimizing risk. If you have high returns and wonder why you returns are so much higher than standard investment funds its probably because you are here

Yah you may good returns, you are probably taking on more risk than what you are getting in return.

How high could it go? Well If we take a look at the graph below, we can see that SPCE peaked at around 60 bucks  back in February in ANTICIPATION for the previous test flight which was delayed until May for safety reasons (They had some problems with electromagnetic interference which is fixed now).

Currently the price is around 18-19 bucks, so it's an absolute steal in my opinion, but there is always the risk that some shit fucks up and the test flight is delayed even further, in which case I will have to sell the house.

In this post I'm going to not talk about some kind of currency that can get this post removed. Hint: it crashed big time yesterday. You know the one.

There is a new kind of this currency that uses a lot of computer storage space. How much? Well - 7 EXABYTES and it's currently adding 1 exabyte every 3 days. I'm going to assume you know about this currency and if not you can look through my post history and see which subreddit I've posted to recently involving this particular one.

* WDC Fundamentals

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

I am not investing in the company as a get-rich-quick scheme, but plan to hold long term. **Saphyr** technology will continue to improve directly with design improvements, but also indirectly with the data that it continuously collects will create more accurate correlations of DNA with individual predispositions for disease. 

I believe the technology will allow for a more personal approach in the field of medicine, and should not be viewed solely as a research-based company.  

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community.

A little bit about myself for context:

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/555339dhob071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42585b1cfe4cf1c85eab62b0cc01791f5321f1e2

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",nh8f2j,PUBM DD #1

To add that that tech is scaleable to other space operations, safe and redundant, it blows SPCE out of the water.

SPCE only has a following because they are publically traded. In the space community, most people look at then with wary eyes. I wonder how many people they kill before they get shut down.

Having said that, this company recently filed an S-3 Shelf Registration Statement with the SEC to sell $350M of stock at the market price, whenever they choose.  So your position is about to, if not already, get seriously diluted.  When they filed, it was trading at $9.  Now it's $5.xx.  So assuming an average of $7, that's 50 million new shares being issued.

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001411690/000114036121009770/nt10022040x1\_424b5.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001411690/000114036121009770/nt10022040x1_424b5.htm)

This is in addition to the 29M shares they issued in January. 

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001411690/000114036121000735/nt10018741x4\_424b5.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001411690/000114036121000735/nt10018741x4_424b5.htm)

So this company has shown a proclivity to issue new shares as they need to refill their coffers at the expense of the shareholders.  I'm not sure I would like being constantly diluted every time they need money.

Right now they have a market cap of $1.5B on $10M of TTM revenue, -$40M of TTM net income, and -$153M of accumulated deficit.

So, that's a hard pass from me.",,

‚ÄúBulls want to see Tilray‚Äôs stock break up bullish from the symmetrical triangle and regain support of the 21-day EMA. If Tilray makes a bullish move, it has room to move up towards the $17.50 level. If its stock was able to break above that level with momentum, it could reach $20.80 before bumping into more resistance.

Bears want to see Tilray‚Äôs stock break down bearish from the triangle and lose support of the eight-day EMA. If the stock does break bearish from the triangle, it could fall down to meet support at the 200-day SMA but if that level didn‚Äôt hold, it could fall further toward $11.87.‚Äù",,

I think it's already priced in for Ford, the only way that will cause a surge on their end will be if fleet sales go in an unexpected direction. Which I don't think they will. Because that's what unexpected means.   


However, I do see that hype as deflating RIDE a little bit.   


I got out yesterday with like a hundred bucks' profit. I got in late April for around $9/share for like $300 invested.   
Rule of three. If something's been going well for you three days in a row, consider taking profit.   


I'm not even pretending there was anything more to it than a superstitious impulse. No math, no logic, no patterns. I just felt like it was about to go the other way because it had gone the green direction for too long.

Much more strict privacy measures are being put in place. Nevertheless, PUBM raised their guidance considerably during their Q1 report. They have mentioned over and over again that they are anticipating the changes in the digital ad markets investing accordingly. I can't speak to the technical details, as I am unqualified, but I can say that a 12% return on tangible book value shows that their investments have been paying off and that they are able to effectively stay ahead of the changes.",,

Within a month or two, buying hard disks will be pointless as the only way to keep a ROI on it will be SSDs (already is), and these in turn will also quickly become obsolete in terms of ROI due to the insane amount of storage added to it, making returns plateauing.

That's when you will get a tsunami wave of individuals dumping their hard drive farms in the second hand market, relieving retail demand for storage space and killing prices.

In other words, the new currency has a spike in storage demand now, but given its trajectory vs. the ROI that is achieved it's very likely to lead to quick dumps of the bought storage space to the second hand market as it's already considered 'late' to enter by individuals. Once people realize that for every day that passes they need additional terabytes of space just to stay in the same ROI, they will get off it quickly.",,

Trophy Trucks in the front and the Endurance Truck in the front had similar setups, just the Endurance had that extra weight on its front wheels.

Regarding the rear, you might be right that a solid axle weighs a bit, but the axle acts as a component of the suspension in connecting the suspension to the wheels. You would need two independent suspensions for the Endurance which when you factor everything in (including the dual motors), well I can't say for certain, but am guessing the Endurance has some extra weight there (but maybe not much difference).

Also, thinking about a solid-axle with a single suspension versus in-wheel motors with independent suspensions (and no axle), I would think the solid-axle design, even it it weighs the same, would better allow the forces to be distributed over the full suspension whereas an independent design could result in more forces acting on one side or the other (i.e. unsprung weight is a bigger issue without a solid-axle perhaps).

Perhaps a rear-drive setup would have been better for LMC, but they might not get enough power out of just two motors, hence they need all-wheel drive.

I think you make good points and I am speculating a bit here. Bottom line, it seems to me, that the Endurance performed as expected if unsprung mass is an issue. Without someone having access to measure every aspect of it and compare there is really no way to know for sure whether what I am saying is correct, but to me it makes sense.",,

Then in 2020 and they had 255.3M in revenue, or a -24% growth rate. Yet the stock is WAY WAY WAY higher than before pandemic and before Pandemic their growth rate was practically 0%. Now it is negative. Even if Build a Bear would regain its entire 2019 revenue the fair value of the stock is before $5. Don't listen to the news outlets pumping reopening socks so they can dump these massive bags on you. The market has Build a Bear style stocks everywhere right now. Look at SEAS it is the same story and its fair value is under $20 based on pre-pandemic revenue.

You mentioned the inability to filter ad presentation. The fact that they can't do something as simple as not putting a Disney ad on pornhub is really telling.

* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either.

9064,,2021-05-19 20:14:45,t3_ngftx1,,wallstreetbets,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",ngftx1,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Mr. Cramer..."

9067,,2021-05-19 20:51:00,t3_nggpql,,wallstreetbets,"I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

9069,,2021-05-19 21:25:26,t3_nghmhm,,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",nghmhm,$NUE is strong as steel. Buy the dips.

Petco earnings is tomorrow pre-market. But this also might be a potential candidate for a short squeeze.

Short sellers are gearing up for a bad quarter. For the last three days, the short float increased from 4 point-something Monday, 6.05 yesterday, and today it's at 8.75.

In addition, short interest is up to 35.2%

To top it off, there are hardly any shares available to short, though borrowing rate remains at only 1%. For the last five days there were no more than 100k shares left to short.

The average price target is $28, but if earnings goes better than expected, this could be the catalyst for something significantly bigger. Listen to your pets' beckoning calls, and keep this on your watch list!

The stock is up 64% since the close on 5/13, through 5/19. Closing volume has ramped up steadily over the same period from 6.3m to 42.4m

Two major catalysts are on the near horizon:

1) Earnings report on 5/24 AH: Confirmation of late Q3 production and disclosure of binding orders have a high probability of being announced.

2) Lordstown Week (June 21-25): Plant open house for tours, test drives, etc., and above all else, transparency.  This should alone should put the final nail in the shorts coffin.

9081,,2021-05-20 05:24:49,t3_ngrqqf,,wallstreetbets,"Some context: Cell carriers in the US have decided to stop the function of shared short codes (5-6 digit phone numbers) June 1. Shared short codes were the preferred means of SMS and MMS communication for B2C traffic. Short codes were free to lease in many cases, text messages were cheap, thousands of businesses could send from the same number, and throughput was incredibly high (lots of messages could be sent very fast).

The new policy enforced by the CTIA (The private club all major cell phone carriers are in) is that shared short codes are to be discontinued and replaced by dedicated short codes and A2P 10dlc (approved B2C traffic on 10-digit phone numbers). This means that every business/organization that wants to send texts must either apply for a dedicated short code or apply for a 10DLC. 

Dedicated short codes are the preferred choice for large corporations. They can handle large throughput and look good for the brand. However, they only cater to large corporations because they are thousands of dollars/year to lease. Turn around time for application is 4-6 weeks. Barrier to entry is high.

10DLC is the preferred choice for the smaller businesses since it's less expensive. But, it is still far more expensive than the shared short codes businesses are used to, requires application, and costs $50/mo in carrier and registration fees alone. Turn around time for application is less than a week. On top of fees, 10dlc isn't even fully ready. The Campaign Registry, the organization responsible for rolling out ""the new messaging standard"" for the CTIA, is still developing their API.

Enter Toll-free messaging. TF has 0 barrier to entry and can be issued to a business with SMS and MMS capabilities in seconds. It's the easiest and now the most cost-effective way to send commercial messages.

Conveniently, every major carrier announced this month (for the first time) that they will start collecting a $0.0025/message fee for every sms sent. They're ready for and expecting businesses to move to this method.

Who is Zipwhip: Zipwhip was given full reign over all TF traffic. Anyone in the US  that wants to send messages on TF codes uses Zipwhip in one way or another. They are a massive reseller that everyone is required to go through.

It was recently announced the Twilio plans on acquiring Zipwhip for $850M. Twilio is the leader is programmable messaging hands down. 

Honestly, there should be antitrust issues that arise and block the acquisition. If it goes through, Twilio owns the new world of business sms. Good chance regulators won't notice any issue. They'll miss the fact that businesses will be pressured into TF over their preferred solutions (dedicated short codes and A2P 10DLC) since it's unnecessarily complicated and expensive. TF is ready now and cheap.

TL;DR if Twilio successfully acquires Zipwhip, every small to medium sized business that wants to send texts will have to go through them. Every single one of them in the US.",ngrqqf,$TWLO stands to be the primary source for commercial text messaging

9084,,2021-05-20 08:25:07,t3_ngulnq,,wallstreetbets,"So just how big is **today's news about the initial success of the Sofusa technology**?

1st, this is a technology that aims at lymphatic delivery. 

**What does this mean?** Well, when trying to fight a disease, it's difficult to target the lymphatic system. Because of how it works and the fact that it is spread throughout our body. 

So there are MANY, MANY drugs out there that treat several conditions through the lymphatic system. But, because of what we just explained, those drugs sometimes don't work. They are not properly ""delivered"". They don't get to where they need to get to make the necessary interaction and solve the problem.

**Sorrento has developed a technology that can deliver drugs to where they actually need to go** in the lymphatic system. So this is definitely breakthrough technology. Other companies are aiming to find similar solutions. But we are definitely talking about very advanced bio-tech.

In this case, we have a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. This is a condition that worsens with time. It's very painful and limits the patient's movement. It's not very common, so we are talking about 1.5 million people in the USA and about 30 million worldwide. 

But remember, **the technology Sorrento is developing  will be able to deliver drugs treating many other diseases** related to the lymphatic system. So the market for Sofusa is very, very large.

The press release tells us Sofusa was tested on ""First Enbrel-Non-Responding"" patients. 

**What does this mean?** Patients who need the drug Enbrel and, even though they have not been taking the drug for long (it's a ""first"" for them) they are not responding to it. It isn't helping them. 

Now, Sofusa comes into play. It's job is to deliver Enbrel to the patient effectively. To ""take"" Enbrel to where it needs to go in the lymphatic system.. 

The 1st obvious advantage is that the drug wasn't helping and now helps. But there are other important advantages.

Since the drug is being carried to its targeted ""destination"" the dosage needed, diminishes. Because less is ""lost along the way"". This is important because many diseases related to the lymphatic system, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are chronic, lifelong conditions. Being able to administer less drugs really helps the patient. Now you have a drug that actually works, more potently, which reduces its dosage. All this thanks to Sorrento.

The press release points out an important factor: This is a trial on ONE type of drug/treatment. Other such trials testing the effectiveness of Sofusa are already taking place. Again, this is proof of the potentially huge market for this delivery system.

Just to get an idea, the release mentions anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. These are a type of drugs that inhibit the activity of certain proteins (they inhibit PD1 and CTLA4, which are types of proteins. By stopping their activity, they help in stopping the growth of cancer tumors). There are several drugs that fall under these categories and treat a wide variety of cancers. **Sofusa can potentially play a vital role in all these treatments**. 

This is like several companies developing apps while Sorrento is developing a new smartphone technology. Each app has its rightful use and market. But once the new smartphone is up and working, all apps will need it. So this technology has huge revenue implications. T**he fact we are hearing good news about it is HUGE**.

As for the results themselves: **The DAS28 test measures rheumatoid activity in 28 joints** in the patient's body. The joints might be swollen or tender (hurting).

This patient had a DAS28 score of 4.6, with 18 out of 28 joints compromised.  That is considered  moderate to high disease activity.  There are 4 levels of DAS 28 scores going from remission (the best) to high (the worst). So this patient was not in the worst shape going in, but pretty bad.

Using Sofusa to deliver the Enbrel drug, in just 4 weeks (this is a very short time for this type of disease!!) the results went from 4.6 to 3.0. The total amount of compromised joints, from 18 to 11. **That is a dramatic change**. The patient went from being somewhere between level 3 and 4, to being in the lower level 2, called ""low disease activity"", which indicates it's moving towards remission (the lowest level). For someone suffering from this condition, it's a real life changer. For the company selling Enbrel, it's a real market changer. And if it can equally help people with tumors, **Sofusa becomes a major therapeutic factor.** 

I hope investors understand this. **It's another major development in an already extremely promising pipeline** which is currently badly undervalued. If the price doesn't spike today by 10-15%, as it should, just from this news, it would be disappointing. 

But if you are long, today's price change isn't what matters the most. It‚Äôs the understanding that Sorrento / SRNE has ANOTHER ace in its hand!",ngulnq,How Big is SRNE news release about Sofusa success?

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC and its +23% run in the past week. A stock with a massive dividend. A stock trading with a very low P/E of and income growth of 4,200%.

So why is this stock still a buy and hold for me right now?

The CEO is positioning them to increase shareholder value, but also position the company to weather any reduction in the refi market. (65% of the business)

There are major catalysts that have been driving the increase in price that goes beyond the attention gained on WSB.

* Announced **NET earnings of $860M in the first quarter,** with huge margins.
* Reaffirmed a continued dividend, the next ex-dividend date is **6/9/2021**.
* Announced a **$300M stock buyback, representing as much as 40% of the free float** at the current prices.
* Russell index inclusion was missed last quarter due to confusion about their PREVIOUS status as a SPAC. It is expected that they will be reconsidered for Russell Index inclusions in the yearly reconstitution. While not the biggest catalyst, this is a sign of reputation and long-term stability for the stock. **The prelim list publishes 6/4/2021.**
* Creation of a jumbo mortgage product. The average loan origination in the market is \~410,000, indicating that the non-conforming section of the mortgage market is *exploding.* This is a very profitable sector of loan origination.

Other fundamentals driving a buy recommendation:

* Small float. 90M float, of which only about 60M is freely trading.
* This stock is not persistently pressured down quite as hard as others due to low share availability, but it appears based on the last two weeks it's trading the small waves of this stock to try to push it down under dangerous strike prices. A wave of positive sentiment could strangle this position in the stock. I don't have a Bloomberg terminal, but based on the evidence over the last several days, the indication is the 13.1% SI has grown.
* Exceptional open option interest for **tomorrow 5/21/2021.** The options expiring tomorrow have been documented elsewhere so I won't belabor them, but the open interest at the $9, and $10 strike represent almost 10% of the free float.
* Not a new startup, **they have been in this business since 1986**, making them almost as old as a fossil like me. They clearly survived the 2008 storm. This company isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

The cherry:

* **STILL forecasting growth in Q2**, whereas many of its competitors are not.

This post is NOT financial advice, but as someone who has ridden the waves of this stock since it was about $9, I see this position turning positive and the outlook through July for this position has high sentiment. Even if the mortgage market slows down as expected, I will hold these shares for years to come for the dividends and general stability of the organization.

My position 8000 shares @ 7.65 and 45x 6/18 8c. You can go stalk the fuck out of me if you want to see that I've been talking about this stock for some time and been saying the same thing about the strength and targets of their position since March. I am also the guy that tells you when you unintentionally reveal personal info on your yolo screenshots!

TLDR: UWMC should garner close attention for value investors looking for undervalued positions.

can't stop the work.

9095,,2021-05-20 13:28:43,t3_nh08j4,,wallstreetbets,"**Investment Thesis**

Overall, what makes MDXG a good buying opportunity right now is a combination of two factors.

* Number one is management‚Äôs miscommunication with the market. The market currently believes that wound care is the core business of MDXG, is not entirely aware of the potential of its biopharma pipeline and more specifically its Amniofix drug, and has priced the company based on this.¬†
* Number two is the huge potential of the Amniofix treatment and its ability to become the next blockbuster in the healthcare space after the conclusion of its phase 3 trial.

**Idea Summary**

MiMedx Group *(MDXG)* is a leading BioPharma and wound care business whose value has been drastically misunderstood by the market. Through drivers such as miscommunication from management about the company‚Äôs valued proposition as well as the lack of institutional investor coverage, the market currently believes that the majority of the company‚Äôs value sits in its low growth wound care business. In reality, its major competitive advantage is within its osteoarthritis drug Amniofix which has the potential to become the next blockbuster after it clears phase III clinical trials. A sum of the parts valuation was used to determine a minimum implied upside of at least 300%. Risks are discussed at the end.

**Business Overview**

MiMedx Group is a leading biopharma and advanced wound care business utilizing human placental tissues to develop products used in the healthcare sector. It processes placental tissues using its patented processes to produce allografts, which are tissues transplanted from one person to another for wound care and regeneration. These allografts are effective in healing difficult wounds because of the ability of the allograft cells to quickly associate with the cells of the patient, thereby taking part in the healing process, easing the ability of the body to close the wound, and speeding up the body‚Äôs regeneration process.

MDXG‚Äôs product offerings can be split into two business segments: wound care and biopharma (surgical solutions). Its flagship product Epifix and additional product Epicord fall under its wound care umbrella, and its flagship product Amniofix as well as additional products Amniocord, Amniofill, and Epiburn fall under its biopharma umbrella. The wound care products service the broad wound care industry, targeting specifically chronic wounds. The biopharma product line is more specific, with the flagship treatment Amniofix targeting knee osteoarthritis in specific.¬†

MDXG sells through direct sales, sales agents, and distributors in the United States. This past quarter, 95% of its sales were direct to customers such as healthcare professionals and facilities.¬†

**Internal Analysis**

The past 3 years have not been ideal for MDXG. Its revenues began to dip in 2018 around the time of their accounting scandal, the growth went from 40% in 2018, to 11% in 2019, and is currently around -16%. This sent their stock price tumbling from $16 USD to lows of almost $1 USD, though it is currently trading at $9 with new updates on their biopharma pipeline.

Their gross margin has stayed very high, around 80% while their EBITDA margins have dropped over the years. Though it wasn‚Äôt explicitly disclosed, a large part of this drop in EBITDA margins has been attributed to a temporary increase in legal fees due to the litigation MDXG has faced this past year. Its decreased volume may have also suppressed margins as the number of wound care treatments in hospitals significantly dropped during COVID-19.¬†

The company‚Äôs cash balance is sitting at a very high level of 84 mm. This is in large part due to its recent capital raise, which happened to be strongly criticized by one of MDXG‚Äôs activist investors, Prescience Point Capital (discussed in detail later).

**External Analysis**

*Wound Care Market*

The global wound care market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% from 2021 to 2028. This has been driven by the aging population and rising rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Wound care products are increasingly being used to prevent and surgical site infections.¬†

Though the overall market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% the specific advanced product segment which includes products such as those of MDXG‚Äôs which target chronic and non-healing wounds, is projected to grow much faster than 4.1%.¬†

The wound care market is relatively fragmented, with large players such as Integra LifeSciences, 3M, Johnson & Johnson, and Medtronic competing to gain the most market share. MDXG‚Äôs direct competition for its allograft advanced wound care treatments include Organogenesis, Axogen, Mediwound, and Vericel.¬†

Organogenesis is currently in the lead in this niche market, and while MDXG reported an 11% YoY decline in sales in 2020 (which has already been factored into the current price), Organogenesis reported a 30% increase. This is evident when comparing the stock performance of both companies over the past year (figure 1)

*Osteoarthritis Therapy Market*

91 million U.S. adults have arthritis, 20M have knee OA, and \~32 million per year are currently treated for plantar fasciitis, which is specifically targeted by MDXG‚Äôs Amniofix drug. There are very few FDA approved treatments for knee OA and plantar fasciitis, and those that exist have low efficacy and many drawbacks. Amniofix is currently the only treatment of its nature in phase 3 clinical trials that have posted very positive results in both company and independent trials, has been used off-label by >100K patients with zero severe adverse effects, and consistently demonstrates a significant reduction in pain as reported by patients. In addition, Amniofix has an RMAT (regenerative medicine advanced therapy) designation granted by the FDA which allows for MDXG to benefit from an expedited approval process from the FDA.

*Management Miscommunication*

The current market opinion of MDXG has been blurred by the miscommunication from company management whose goals do not align with maximizing shareholder value. This is largely due to the fact that EW healthcare, a private equity firm, has 33% representation on the board as a result of its 17% stake. From a corporate finance perspective, a private equity firm‚Äôs interests do not generally tend to align with those of public shareholders. Their influence has been exacerbated by the fact that there are no large institutional holdings in MDXG as of yet other than Prescience Point, and there has been minimal coverage on the stock leading to the market‚Äôs opinion on the company being heavily skewed by management communications.¬†

MDXG‚Äôs current growth strategy is focused on roll-ups in the wound care space. This is very characteristic of a private equity playbook, and goes alongside EW‚Äôs historical acquisitions. As was mentioned in the external analysis, the wound care space is growing at a slow rate of \~4.1%, however MDXG has lost significant market share to Organogenesis. Management has failed to realize that the current value driver of the business is within its biopharma line and not its wound care line, yet has continually communicated to shareholders that it believes it is in fact wound care and it is going to continue investing in growing within the industry.

Prescience Point Capital, an activist investor group which has advocated for change in MDXG's communication strategy, has supported the fact that MDXG‚Äôs communications have been focused on the wrong industry. At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, the potential for the drug Amniofix was drastically undersold and much time was spent convincing investors that the core business is in wound care. The 3.6% decline in shares two days after the conference illustrates how effective this strategy was.¬†

There has been strong opposition from MDXG‚Äôs board of directors to Prescience Point‚Äôs activist efforts. In a shareholder letter in early May, prior to their annual meeting, the company communicated that they believe the wound care and regenerative medicine direction being followed now is ideal. They stated that the activist investor does not understand pharmaceutical company disclosure and were advocating for speculative actions themselves though Prescience‚Äôs report discusses the opposite, with them outlining how EW‚Äôs influence on the board of directors is shifting the company‚Äôs focus away from maximizing shareholder value.

*Amniofix*

As mentioned in the external analysis, there is currently no other treatment, either in development or on the market, as effective as Amniofix in treating knee OA and also just as safe. Most recently, at its Q1 earnings call, MDXG CEO shared positive results from the phase IIb prospective trial of the treatment. There was a statistically significant reduction in VAS (visual analog score) for pain and an improvement in the foot function index score. There were also no serious adverse events during this clinical trial. Amniofix is currently in phase III trials, and MDXG believes they are on target to meet all criteria needed to find a biologics license application (BLA) so that the treatment can be introduced to the general public. MDXG is aiming to file their BLA in the first half of 2022, meaning that within a year this blockbuster treatment could be on the market, and given the feedback so far from clinical trials as well as the RMAT designation, it is highly likely.

A Prescience Point market capture analysis estimated that the treatment would bring in $4,050 million of annual sales. This is \~8 times higher than the current sales brought in through wound care. One year ago it would have been prudent to not entirely incorporate this into the share price, however today with clinical trials nearing completion and MDXG‚Äôs new RMAT designation, the likelihood of approval is much higher.

**Valuation**

From a valuation point of view, a quick sum of the parts analysis is the most ideal given the two different business lines of MDXG. A more in-depth DCF can be created once more cost information is provided from MDXG after the conclusion of clinical trials.

Shares outstanding of 109.8 mm, total debt of 51.8 mm, and total cash of 84.7mm were used to convert from enterprise value to equity value. The current implied upside was calculated using the current price of $9.46.

*Wound Care Valuation*

MDXG‚Äôs FY 2021 sales guidance assumed $255 mm to $270 mm in revenue from the wound care segment. Different points in this revenue ranged were used for the low, base, and high cases of the valuation. An EV/Revenue multiple was used to calculate implied enterprise value. The comparables analysis shown in figure 2 illustrated the median multiples derived from the analysis done using the aforementioned list of MDXG‚Äôs competitors. A median multiple of 5.3x was used. The median was used and not marked down because the gross margin and UFCF yield of MDXG is in-line with all competitors. Though the EBIDTA multiple was lower, the similar yield and gross margins indicate that company performance is relatively the same. In addition, litigation expenses factored into the lower EBIDTA multiples and thus it is not indicative of recurring performance.

Based on the revenue multiples, implied share values for the wound care segment range between $12.0 and $12.8.

**Wound Care Equity Value**

**Biopharma Valuation**

Prescience Point estimated annual revenues from Amniofix through using the market capture method. The total market size (annual knee OA injections) was estimated, and a capture percentage was applied to determine the annual number of patients receiving the Amniofix injection. Prescience assumed 1.5 injections per year but to be more conservative in this valuation 1 was used. Price per injection and FDA approval probability varied by the cases and were used to adjust the EV/Rev multiple downwards. Overall, an implied share value range between $25.4 and $57.1 was calculated for this segment.

https://preview.redd.it/we0pw4jm1a071.png?width=611&format=png&auto=webp&s=567d19cc5acc59acbe552a2afcf09789c80866ff

**Biopharma Equity Value**

Overall, the total implied share price ranges between $37.43 to $69.81. As more information regarding Amniofix comes out including the price of manufacturing, different multiples can be used to fine-tune the analysis.

https://preview.redd.it/a8035yfo1a071.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=12e0f9a041e326b505bfda25304261367c651406

**Risks**

1. Given the high influence EW healthcare has on the board of directors, there is potential for more value to describe acquisitions such as that of stability biologics, which was bought for 10 million and sold for 3.5 million 3 years later. If such a trend continues, the value of MDXG‚Äôs wound care business can dramatically decrease, which will hurt the share pierce
2. The FDA approval of Amniofix is a large driver of the valuation calculated. There is a large risk that the FDA will not approve the treatment, however, with the RMAT designation in place and positive results from the first two phases of clinical trials, the odds are strongly in the favour of the approval at the current point in time.

For those who don't know, $EEM - or the iShares Emerging Markets ETF - is comprised of stocks from developing nations, with a **ton** of room to grow. These countries **will** all catch up soon, it's only a matter of time. This is one of the many reasons I find this setup especially interesting.

Here are the top holdings:

[$EEM Holdings \(By Country\)](https://preview.redd.it/zh7nwb2hfa071.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cb2749a2c7d6c7f548ad89a3f9a746b56d2273)

Next, let's dig into the charts -

Chart 1: **Max Monthly (\~16 Years)**

[$EEM Max Monthly](https://preview.redd.it/ylknrqzhea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=91ee9718b89c47744e6f68224a133c48c7bcfc6f)

Here you can see we have a **symmetrical triangle** pattern that dates back to late 2007. In technical analysis, the longer the pattern has been building, the more significant the breakout will be. Subsequently - you can imagine the magnitude a pattern like this has.

When making new all time highs I like to look for psychological resistances. As a result - logical targets for this pattern are **75.00, 100.00.** Sounds simple, but it works in practice. Keep in mind - something like this will take **3 - 5 years** to play out. This is a position trade.

In order for this breakout to stay valid - we need to continue getting monthly closes above **50.85.** You can see we've pretty much gone perfectly sideways since breaking out for **4 months** now.

This is **bullish -** moving sideways in a higher range is always biased to the upside (except in special situations with certain reversal patterns). Not only that, but we've been forming an interesting setup on the next chart I will show you all -

Chart 2: **1 Year 1 Day**

[$EEM 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/7hy7wbqeea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8102c5b1f0e92c02260cfccc6b8d77eafea8035d)

On this chart - you can make much more sense of those 4 months of sideways. We are actually working on a large **falling wedge** \- which is a bullish continuation pattern. The breakout point for this is sitting around **54.37** as I am writing this (5/20/2021).

Upon breaking this (ignoring the previous chart) - we would target **54.94, 56.49, 57.32, 60.00, 65.00.** That would be if there was no setup on the monthly chart. Each of these are resistances we could stop and consolidate at. I like to scale in after breaking each resistance. Scale into winners and cut losers fast. A break from a pattern like this would probably take **3 - 6 months** to play out.

I also want to note that **MASSIVE** increase in volume on 3/26. Generally - an uptick on volume when price is doing what you want it to is always a plus. But one like that is very intriguing - on a huge green candle too. My guess would be someone loaded their bags there (or a group of players).

And... **that's it.** Keep it simple. Those are often the best setups.

***TL;DR -***

$EEM has a big pattern - broke out 4 months ago just chopping sideways waiting for the move to happen.

Price targets **75.00, 100.00**

Stop out below **50.87** monthly close

Timeframe **3-5 years**

It also has a smaller pattern above that one - which breaks out above **54.37** and has a shorter time horizon.

Price targets **60.00, 65.00**

Stop out if we close back inside

Timeframe **3-6 months**

***Positions -***

10% of my long term portfolio is in emerging markets ETFs and,

August **55c @ 0.91** \- Will always roll these back before they get below 60 DTE - Will scale in heavily after the smaller pattern breaks out

\- Research coming out of John Hopkins University is suggesting that the use of Psilocybin is the most effective drug ever tested as a remedy for depression, anxiety, and PTSD. As the United States is currently under crisis in its battle against mental illness, these results are too impressive to ignore, even if it may need to overcome pressures from big pharma interest groups that seek to quell the expansion of this research.

\- These drugs have been extremely effective in treating addiction -- particularly alcohol and nicotine. Considering the government expenditure on the opioid crisis, once this proves to be an effective treatment, the government will expedite the medicinal legalization of the substances that MNMD has been treating/experimenting with.

\- Veterans, the most respected occupational category (statistically,) have begun launching advocacy groups for the widespread medicinal legalization of these substances due to their effectiveness against PTSD. These therapeutic measures have contributed to the plummeting of suicide rates (those treated w/ psilocybin vs. control group.) The Biden administration will have to choose ethics and reason over the suffering of veterans (former government employees) which I anticipate that they will given mounting pressure due to the effectiveness of these treatments.

&#x200B;

Does this hinge on expected earnings in the long-run ... certainly!

&#x200B;

But the effectiveness of this research is undeniable and can no longer be overlooked ... because of new cultural acceptance of these alternative treatments the government's hand will be forced in legalize, or otherwise be responsible for mental illness and addiction -- all of which could be treated and cured.

If you aren't familiar with the efficient frontier, what it tries to find is the *mean-variance portfolio.* This type of model deals with portfolio management / optimization. In terms of the efficient frontier you are trying to find the best portfolio allocation weights that give you the best risk adjusted returns. 

**In simple words:** you give it stocks and it tells you the best percentage holdings

I recently built an app on some python code that does this sort of optimization. There is no programming required to use the app. When running the app it will give two portfolios, minimum variance, and maximized sharpe (same as mean-variance, mean-markowitz). Minimum variance will tell you the least riskiest holding strategy (green), and max sharpe will give you the best reward-for-risk holding (red). I call that portfolio *the-juice-is-worth-the-squeeze.* Here is a sample output.

I used around 100,000 simulations, and 10Y of adjusted close data. 

The reason why I bring this up is because it does two things. The first is that it promotes portfolio diversification, which I know is pretty uncommon here. Also it finds the most aggressive returns in terms of minimizing risk. If you have high returns and wonder why you returns are so much higher than standard investment funds its probably because you are here

How high could it go?

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community.

A little bit about myself for context:

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/555339dhob071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42585b1cfe4cf1c85eab62b0cc01791f5321f1e2

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",nh8f2j,PUBM DD #1

I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

If you are long congrats. However if you are gonna tell me about their amazing tech & innovation fuck off!  UPST is just another overvalued, Ai, SaaS, Payment High-flyer who forgot it‚Äôs 2021 but IPO‚Äôed late last year under the shadow of ABNB & DASH however just like the ladder two GOLDMAN is also their Godfather (took all 3 public) and GS takes care of it‚Äôs babies.  Compared to it‚Äôs more celebrated peers UPST was of to a slow start. IPO‚Äôed at $20 (the low end of the range $20 - $24), hardly drew any buzz and post IPO sat around for a few days kinda lost. 

GOLDMAN TO THE RESCUE: Once Goldman shoved a stupidly high valuation which the market accepted for ABNB & DASH then it focused it‚Äôs attention on poor little UPST and started to drive interest for the shares (part of the GS starter kit when you select them to run your IPO which founders & round investors love.  They need to make sure to pump the price hard before lock-up expiration *THIS IS KEY.

RECAP: UPST, went public at $20 in Dec the week after the other two and once public had a $1.8 Billion valuation and already trading at a rich valuation (just earlier in 2020 it has been valued around $800MM).  

TODAY‚Äôs VALUATIONS: Fast forward; today UPST is valued over $10 Billion trading at a whopping $135 per share Est PE: 200X PS: 40X PB: 30X (regardless of future potential growth these are disgustingly high valuations) oh JUST OVER 40% OF THE SHARES ARE STILL LOCKED!  

TRADE / LOCKUP EXPIRATION / JULY: Lock you for UPST is scheduled for early July which will increase the float by 40% and this event will trigger pressure on the shares (round investors selling, in creasing the supply) and mixed with a higher interest rate environment and stupid high valuations WILL CUT THE CURRENT PRICE BY AT LEAST 50%. (You know very well every single 2020 high flyer was cut in half this year. UPST is no exception just delayed). 

PROOF:  Goldman was the investment bank for several other similar IPO‚Äôs and applied the same formula.  Check to procure movements, IPO, ramp up, expiration lockup followed by substantial decrease of share prices.  SNOW, DASH, ABNB, BIGC, FROG, PLTR.  

BY AUG THE PRICE WILL BE $50-$60 AND I‚ÄôLL BE UP 200% ON MY SHORTS",,

Coinbase is one of the top 5 most profitable exchanges in the world. Coinbase might make more money than Nasdaq. Coinbase is going to be huge because this is the first time we are able to directly play crypto in the equity market. Why I like COIN is that it is a play on Bitcoin AND all the other coins out there...whereas bitcoin is just a play on bitcoin, so you are getting all the other coins for free. COIN is heavily (96%) tied to the price of bitcoin, which is very hard to predict. Another advantage of COIN being the first crypto exchange coming onto the market first is that they potentially can use their stock as currency to buy any other competitors. And you don't have to believe in the crypto party line and the dangers of fiat currency and how you need an alternative, because central banks all over the world are printing money like crazy - even if you think this is nonsense, we know that there is a market for this kind of nonsense because gold bugs have been saying the same thing for decades. In other words, crypto has a natural constituency. Like gold, people buy it as a kind of inflation insurance and gold's strength is its scarcity - its supply only increases about 1% per year and it is getting harder and harder to find more - that sounds a lot like Bitcoin to me and I think it is totally legitimate to believe that crypto, in general, can rival gold as a storehold of value.",,
