4,,2021-05-23 18:07:18,t3_njdcw5,,investing,"SPACs might be dead (sorry Chamath), but this one merger has a cult-like following as the buzz around the name continues to grow. This SPAC is IPOE and the merger is with FinTech company SoFi. Brick and mortar banks and queuing in line for services is so 2019, in 2021 this process has become *digitized* and the goal is to have a bank in your *pocket*.

**Banks vs FinTech**

The expansion of financial services and cross-selling of them to existing customers has been a common strategy for traditional banks and finch companies alike. Traditional banks have a massive, already established customer base that they can easily cross sell other financial services to. In fact, the top 15 banks in the world control over 50% of all US bank accounts.

SoFi’s moat surrounds 3 different segments:

1. Lending: Personal/student loans and refinancing
2. Tech Platform: Galileo acquisition and payments infrastructure
3. Financial Services: Investing, credit cards, money transfers, etc

**Galileo**

I want to touch up on Galileo because SoFi’s acquisition of the company was highly strategic and has enabled them to integrate at a larger scale. Galileo is a B2B purchasing/payment platform that works with FinTech entities such as Robinhood, Chime, Monzo, and Revolut. With the Galileo platform, these companies can create complex financial payment processes and enable digital banking solutions. Think of Galileo as the infrastructure behind it all and they are growing by over 100% YoY.

**Trends & Growth**

So why don’t the banks just use their existing customer base to expand into the FinTech industry? Short answer: Because they are BOOMERS. The truth is their legacy infrastructure and IT costs do not help when transitioning into the FinTech space. As per Morgan Stanley, most FinTech startups can actually offer these services at nearly 50% cheaper than the traditional banks.

There are some tailwinds the industry is riding that ranges from more and more customers accessing banking services digitally (this number is even higher among millennials), rise in digital payments by over 20% from 2019 into 2020, and FinTech becoming increasingly popular among personal loans.

SoFi’s customer base has been growing at an average of 66% YoY with their last two quarters hitting 75% growth each. It is no doubt that the platform, the industry, and everything about the business is becoming increasingly popular. Management has noted by year-end 2021 they are expecting to hit over 3 million members (currently at 1.7 million).

**Conclusion**

What was mentioned above paints a picture that FinTech is disrupting traditional firms across all avenues of financial services (loans, investments, and banking). Traditional banks are failing to keep ahold of the new generation of customers coming into the market. SoFi is able to circumvent the inefficiencies in our current financial systems and provide unparalleled customer service for all their services.",njdcw5,Some info about FinTech startup IPOE/SoFi: Powering the Future

Buy a S&P 500 ETF and you're getting a mix of value and growth. You can choose to be a little more aggressive towards growth when you're younger and you think the bull market will keep going. You can achieve that by buying small amounts of SPYG (which is the growth stocks of SPY) or buying QQQ (NASDAQ) into your portfolio.

Growth stocks have out performed value the last decade or two. Value from 1927 to today, when dividends are reinvested, have largely outperformed growth over the long-run.

This is better thought of in terms of risk.  Growth stocks are riskier, but they can mean they come with greater potential rewards. When times are good they generally go up in price more. When times are bad they generally fall deeper. Investors are pricing in what companies can become in the future, not what they are now at this very minute. 

Value stocks don't go up as much or down as much,comparatively, but often can give some direct profits to the shareholders along the way.

You want those extra gains during large bull markets, but you don't want to be holding a 100% growth stocks when we enter a recession.

Right now commodities prices are at ATH because of massive undersupply. However supply is getting built out at a crazy rate and the demand spike for a lot of these goods is likely temporary.
This isn't new or unusual, commodities super-cycles are they are known are fairly frequent phenomena. Some people get very rich on the way up, some people get left with some very heavy bags and a few people get very rich on the way down.

Correction in commodities pricing will be violent and brutal. Similar to the bond market commodities are traded using highly levered products called futures so when the crash starts happening (it already has) it will go down very fast.

The other bubble which is probably a year or 2 out from peaking is semiconductor stocks. For now supply is constrained but fabs are being built out massively on a scale never seen before.

Basically they say that shorting is selling a currency pair, where the you expect the ""base"" currency to fall in value. For example, this breakdown by IG: https://www.ig.com/us/trading-strategies/learn-how-to-short-a-currency-190712

But that's the end of their explanation. How does merely selling a currency pair result in a profit? Where and when are you realizing a profit?

Say you start with $10,000 USD, you short the USD, and you're right and it falls in value during the relevant period. Where's your profit coming from in this scenario? Tangibly, how do you end up having more than $10,000 in the bank when it's over? 

For stocks, shorting is supposed to involve ""borrowing"" shares of stock, selling them, waiting for the drop, and then buying and returning the shares to whomever lended them to you. (I have no idea how one borrows shares of stock, but apparently it's a thing.) The explanations for shorting forex don't mention any comparable process of borrowing, selling, and re-buying the currency. So how do you profit in the forex case?

92,gz6utqu,2021-05-23 18:54:28,t1_gz6utqu,t1_gz52kgu,investing,"Technically neither. But closer to the first one. Lets assume the dividend is paid quarterly. To calculate dividend yield, they would take the LAST dividend, multiply it by 4 (which simply assumes it continues to be paid every quarter going forward) and divide it by the current share price. 

However, the important things to realize are:
1) There's no guarantee the dividend continues to be paid out. Generally companies try to keep a steady dividend, but hard times can definitely force them to lower or discontinue it.
2) The stock price could move down. If you buy a dividend stock with a 3% yield, and the share price goes down 10% over the year, you're still at -7% on the investment. If a company is paying a dividend, but not making money, you can expect the value of the company (shares) to decline a little each time they pay out that dividend, because they're basically bleeding off the value of the company and they have no cash flow to replace it.

So, a really high dividend yield can be a red flag. That means the market isn't counting on that dividend to continue to pay out, generally speaking. It's similar to how borrowers (and companies) that are sketchy have to pay high interest rates. The high interest is to account for the high risk that they won't pay it back. So don't see a 8% dividend yield and think, ""great, a guaranteed 8% return over the next year"". There's a reason investors aren't buying up that stock despite the strong dividend (paid in the PAST).",,

If it's positive for at least 2 quarters, it's automatically in my short list. Also I check Notes to Financial Statements about the cash to see if they happen to have some refinancing facilities on them that are excluded from Cash Flow Statement, i.e. some revolving credit facility, etc.
Then I Google that stock to see some news articles on them. I tend to be careful about news media embellishing their articles about certain stocks because they are VERY biased towards the whole stock market. Try to find the meat of the matter in the article (i.e. does a move that was covered by the media have perspective or no)
After that, I check some Balance Sheet ratios - quick ratio, liquid ratio. If they check out, I'm jacked to the tits.

If cash flow is negative, I check what the company is doing and how it can prosper.

* Stock pays dividends, you're getting cash out.
* Stock doesn't pay dividends, you sell a few shares periodically to get cash out.

* Stock pays dividends, you have dividends automatically reinvested
* Stock does not pay dividends, you don't do anything.

You need to be aware of which is the case if you want to compare stocks though, so you can avoid comparing apples to oranges.  For instance, I'm looking at O (monthly dividends) vs BRK-B (no dividends) on Yahoo. According to the chart, BRK-B is up 102% and O is up 12.5%  But dividends aren't taken into account.

If you assume reinvested dividends, BRK-B is the same, about +102%, but O is up actually about +40% because you'd have more shares than you initially bought 5 years ago, due to reinvested dividends.

At a macro level, the current value of a stock is just the market's  best estimate of the present value of all future cash flows of the stock. Knowing this, if you can't understand how the news can affect stock prices then you lack some common sense. There are tens of thousands of examples. Let's say a company makes jets, let's say news breaks that the same model crashes for the second time, then let's say news breaks that the reason it crashed was because of a design flaw, then it comes out that the FAA and other foreign aviation authorities are grounding that model, then it comes out that 100's of back orders have been canceled.

They are still being developed (someone already mentioned $*MGXRF / $ZAIR - Zinc8* in the comments) but from what little DD I've done on this company and subject these are some of the conclusions:

1. **Zinc is a readily available and cheap material**
2. **Reusability** \- none of the materials in the battery are actually consumed and as opposed to Lithium Ion (Li-Ion) batteries  they dont have the problem of becoming less efficient with time. If they did become less efficient it would be a matter of renewing the electrolytes as opposed to having to change the whole battery.
3. **Better scalability than Li-Ion batteries -** to scale Li-Ion you basically have to add more stacks of batteries but with Zinc - Air batteries you can simply increase the volume of the tanks containing the electrolytes which makes it cheaper (the caveat being that since they are less energy dense the break even point with Li-Ion battery is at *above 8 hours of energy storage* \- in simpler terms if you need to store ***less*** than 8 hours of energy you're better off with Li-Ion)
4. **Safer -** unlike Li-Ion or Hydrogen these batteries ***don't*** require a controlled environment to operate and aren't flamable which also means that security measures are less strict on sites where these are installed. This in turn also makes them cheaper to deploy.
5. **Still in infancy** \- the technology is in development, has yet to prove it's worth and aren't commercially widespread yet. A few of them are being implemented in defferent places (NYC and Australia are testing them for now) but feels like it could be promising.

I might've missed something so if you want to add to this feel free to do so!

Also, gotta realize what market caps mean for equities and crypto. They're a little bit different. But here's why bitcoin can have a crazy high market cap. 

Picture 10 bananas in a market at a dollar each. 

If one person says they're willing to pay $10 for a banana, then the entire market cap for bananas just went up by 10x. 

Doesn't mean that there is $100 that has been spent in bananas. In fact. it was only $19 put into the market. 

This is why, massive sell offs can tank the price so fast. $1B in sell offs could eliminate $2B in market cap for example.

If you're watching a stock and you'd prefer not to buy it right now, but if it ever goes **above** a certain level, then you want to buy some (so that you can own some before it goes up even further), use a stop-limit buy order.

So if the current price is 50 and you want to buy as soon as it goes down to 40, set a limit order (""buy N shares if price is 40 or below""). But if the price is 50 and you want to buy in case the price goes above 60 (because you think if it ever goes above 60 that would be because of some dramatic good news that means it would be likely to keep going up well over 60), set a stop-limit order with a stop-price of 60 and a limit of, say, 70. So then if the price goes over 60 you'll automatically enter a ""buy N shares if price is 70 or below"" order. So unless the price shoots immediately from below 60 to above 70, you'll get your N shares at a price between 60 and 70.

Hwang and Wood both worked in environments where their investment styles were too risky/volatile.  So with this very little experience they ventured off on their own and got clobbered in less than a decade.

Her remarks about Bitcoin remind me of the common fallacy to which real estate investors subscribe.  In the long run the market will always go up because inflation goes up, everything goes up, but the fluctuations that are profitable in the shorter term are subject to the availability of extant investment capital.

By extant I mean that government creation of additional capital comes at a cost.  That cost is inflation.  Valuations well in excess of fair value cannot rise infinitely because those excess valuations are fueled by excess capital.  When excess capital shrinks, excess valuations shrink first.

Wood is nothing like Buffett not because of her investing record but because of her *ethos*.  Neither she nor Hwang have been around long enough to understand and appreciate the reasoning behind Graham's definition of investing.  That is:

>An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.

In this regard, Wood is not an investor at all.  She's a speculator.  There's a reason that most people touting speculation do the book and motivational speaker circuit... Because if they were any good at investment management, they would still be doing it.",,

1. Stupid wide explosive limits (low H2 / high air = BOOM, high H2 / low air = ALSO BOOM). When in doubt, BOOM.

3. Being a very light and small molecule, hydrogen will diffuse right through metal tank walls. It's not leaking...it's diffusing right through the metal. Fill a perfectly intact tank with hydrogen and wait and the pressure will drop.

However, I am somewhat interested in a related technology: ammonia manufacturing using hydrogen from water electrolysis combining it with nitrogen in the air. Right now we make most ammonia from methane gas using steam reforming and the Haber Bosch process. 

We use a lot of liquid ammonia for crop fertilization and chemical processes and eventually need to get that off of fossil fuel sources.

Grid operations occur on the basis of moment to moment load, so MW is relevant.  But grid operators like PJM also compensate capacity based on possible runtime. If I remember correctly FERC just allowed the minimum runtime in PJM to be reduced to 4 hours from 10 hours.  Basically, a battery systems capacity was derated from peak output to the max output that could be sustained over a minimum runtime. PJM also proposed shifting to an effective load carrying capability approach, which, though not accepted by FERC for the moment, would measure the amount of load a storage system's capacity could offset.

Regardless, this isn't a ""status of that sub"" post, and wanted to share the results of something interesting I did that involves stocks/investing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Right now I'm up 44% YTD, compared to the SP500's 13%.

&#x200B;

Some stats (and a picture of the returns):

[https://i.imgur.com/hqigfrX.png](https://i.imgur.com/hqigfrX.png)

&#x200B;

\- The strategy is **backtested** only to the beginning of 2020, but I'm working on it. It's got an **annualized return of 26%** (compared to 16% for the SP500)

\- **Max drawdown** of -8.7% (thought this was pretty interesting - W\*B would be a very cool hedge for financial markets at large. Rode COVID like a wave)

\- **Sharpe Ratio**: 2.22. Here's an [investopedia link](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharperatio.asp) for those of you that can read

\- Profit-Loss ratio of 3.48.

\- Avg win of 0.85%

\- Avg loss of -0.24%. The fact that this number's absolute value is lower than average win is a good thing

&#x200B;

Anyways, invested around $60k in January myself, I'm at around $90k rn. Not one of my main investment vehicles, and maybe not the smartest investment, but I make myself feel better by telling myself it's smarter than Y\*LOing on puts.

Assuming you want the names you have I would go through them from smallest holding to biggest and ask: why am I holding, what else do I have that fits the thesis, has the the thesis been working, if so do I add (with the proceeds of another sale) and if not let's sell (and use proceeds to add elsewhere)

You've got so many that it will take months to work through. At the end, you'll have a more focused list, you'll know the thesis for each and you might have cash to invest. During this time, you'll have come across other names, and you will not have invested. But you can now deep dive on them, establish their thesis and start adding.

OP is using short term metrics measured in months to question why we should be listening to a specific person, in this case Cathie Woods, someone who has continuously explained that she and her fund operates on a 5 year timeframe. 

Additionally, OP also uses those short term metrics to question why she's being compared to someone like Buffet. Which is quite hilarious when you consider that Buffet is famously a long term ""buy and hold"" kind of investor, who's said ""I don't believe anyone knows what the market is going to do tomorrow, next week, next month, next year"".

Live in one, rent the other, and unless you're in California or something where the prices are insane, your net costs could well be less than you had been paying in rent, plus if the value of your home goes up, the equity gains can be worth more than the rent.

That said, housing prices are generally really high right now, at least in the US, so personally I wouldn't buy any real estate until the next significant dip in housing prices comes. So I'd suggest, stick your money some place relatively safe where you can get it out quickly when you want it (say an index fund), start following your local housing market closely (visit lots of open houses so you start to get a feel for what problems houses can have and how much they're selling for), and then buy your duplex in a year or two when you start to see headlines about housing prices falling,",,

506,gz7ld8j,2021-05-23 22:26:14,t1_gz7ld8j,t1_gz7iitk,investing,"Starting off, I would recommend putting in all the money you can to match your Employers match in your 401k. Not taking advantage of the match is just leaving free money on the table.

After your 401k match, I would recommend doing a back door Roth IRA - with an income over 150k, you can’t contribute to a normal Roth IRA, but you can still do something called an back door Roth IRA, which will let you put 6k into a Roth IRA.

Finally after that, max out your contribution to your 401k. Your 401k will allow you to grow your retirement money tax free, until you withdraw (which will then tax you)

So after filling up your Roth IRA and 401k (about 25,500), I would put the rest into a taxable account (normal brokerage account). The beauty of the Roth and 401k is that the money can all grow tax free - which lets it grow faster. For a taxable, growth is slower since transactions are taxed, so you want to put your money in this last. In addition - 401k money is tax deductible, so you save even more there.

Regarding investments - your 401k will have employer sponsored investments - unfortunately, your choices will vary depending on what you pick. For a Roth/taxable, you have pretty much any choice you want. I recommend index funds - they allow broad diversification of the market, at low costs. The general most recommended one is VTSAX - which invests in the entire United States Stock market. Unless the US collapses, this will increase in value over the next decades. 

This is the most consistent method with the least effort. Unfortunately, duplex house hacking has its own pros and cons that I don’t know too much about. Some others might be able to talk about that, but the strategy above is the best general advice",,

In the EU, billions have been put aside to upgrade the power interlinks between all the countries to make this happen, for instance. Using a combination of solar, wind (offshore and onshore), traditional hydro power and potentially wave/tide power with storage should cover most scenario's. 

A ""trick"" that has recently been deployed in several countries is also paying heavy industry to shut down. In the Netherlands a smelter that uses as much energy as a city of 200,000 people has a contract with the utilities to shut down during peak demand. It's an order of magnitude cheaper than putting in a battery with equal capacity. These kinds of adaptations will make it so that grid energy storage will be much less than previously anticipated and can be filled by batteries.

There's a lot of noise about hydrogen currently, but the first application for hydrogen would probably be shipping, and maybe aircraft. Though regions like Australia and Africa could become a net-exporter of hydrogen (which likely is a more efficient means of energy transportation over thousands of KM than powerlines). But quite frankly only the first steps are just being taken and it certainly hasn't proven itself like grid batteries already have.",,

Regarding RH PFOF -

I noticed after Q3 of last year RH stopped reporting venue-specific information in their [Held NMS Stocks and Options Order Routing Public Report](https://cdn.robinhood.com/assets/robinhood/legal/RHS%20SEC%20Rule%20606a%20and%20607%20Disclosure%20Report%20Q3%202020.pdf)

In [Q4](https://cdn.robinhood.com/assets/robinhood/legal/RHS%20SEC%20Rule%20606a%20and%20607%20Disclosure%20Report%20Q4%202020.pdf) and [since](https://cdn.robinhood.com/assets/robinhood/legal/RHF%20SEC%20Rule%20606%20and%20607%20Disclosure%20Q1%202021.pdf) any venue-specific information is all listed under Robinhood Securities LLC.

I'm not looking for any conspiracies I'm just wondering if there is some sort of loophole RH found in lack of necessity to list entity-specific execution services by using an umbrella company, or if SEC regulation changed.

It's a question purely out of curiosity, I was wondering since the [C&D](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2020/33-10906.pdf) settlement if it made public information specific toward particular stocks/assets with it's PFOF dependent on the service, i.e. if there were divisions dependent on certain assets/order types being directed or non-directed. (Directed meaning RH as customer as obviously it isn't wasn't necessarily a concern for it's actual customers until then).

My theory is that if RH does indeed have crypto holdings these orders would be of asset class that would not perhaps be sourced through a third party-executor.",njjsk1,I may have missed something

1) Is this a trading strategy that anyone currently uses? If so, how successful has it been, and how/when do you use it?

2) Is there a source of this type of information that is fairly up to date (futures performance vs day performance)?

3) Would/should this type of investing strategy work in all three market environments (bear, bull, crab/kangaroo), and if so/not, why so/not?

I know that overall performance in a buy-and-hold portfolio wouldn't be meaningfully different from this strategy, especially when you take into account capital gains taxes and transactions costs and so on, but in volatile markets, or for shorter-term traders, I wonder what this sub thinks of this strategy, even used for an entire index like the S&P 500.",njlara,Does the market (still) do better overnight than during the days?

I'm 38 and live in the USA. I'm employed, and I make the median national income. I want to accrue wealth over the long term. I don't know that I have an accurate understanding of my risk tolerance. I think generally I am very cautious. Before yesterday I was about 70% equities, 15 bonds, 15 cash. I just sold off a lot of my stock. I'm waiting for the account to settle to see my new allocation, but I'm certainly under 50% stocks at this time. I have no debts.

I have been a buy & hold index fund investor for the 20 years of my adult life. It always sort of bothered me that I didn't understand the underlying mechanisms of the markets I was investing in. At some point in the last decade I learned about the Schiller p/e index and thought ""hmm, this doesn't seem good..."" I read *Random Walk,* and I think I understood most of it.

**The Bug Out:**

Recently, I heard a Grantham interview and read some Hussman, and their gloomy prognostication really struck a chord with my natural inclination towards pessimism. They say current prices are unthethered from the underlying assets and and that this is true across all sectors of the market. My friends and the forums are full people  throwing money at speculative investments (crypto, SPAC, etc). My elders are telling me to blindly invest in an index fund and forget about it, because 'historic returns, don't miss the market's big days, it worked for them, etc.'

My armchair diagnosis is that there are a lot of people like me that are blindly investing in broad index funds that could care less about the underlying value of the assets as long as the price keeps going up. I suspect at some time in the future we'll look back and see that index funds were a craze like any other and laugh at the certainly we currently feel that these assets will return 6-8% on average until the end of time. Looking at you Vanguard (who recently told me that a 'normal asset allocation' was 90-95% stocks...hmm). I also think we'll look back and see that the last trick the boomers played on us was propping up their asset valuations with Fed policy and leaving us to hold the bag.

Worst of all, it doesn't seem like anyone I speak these concerns to (friends, family, investment advisors) is really taking them seriously or even hearing them. Am I turning into a flat-earther? Is the king wearing any clothes?

**What Now?**

I've been told you shouldn't try to time the market, and I've read the explainers about how I'm likely to mistime by selling below the peak, buying before the trough, and missing out on gains while out of the market. Frankly, I'm at a point where I don't believe in the market at all. Is not believing in the market at all the same as timing it?

I've heard that market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. I've also read that by definition there is never greater certainty in the market than the day before the bubble pops.

I'm not sure I can just put all of my money in an index fund and sleep at night.  I have the following questions. Have some of you had a bug-out like I'm having now and that led you to value investing? Do you still believe in index funds in this current market? The knowledge requirements to be a value investor seem much higher than for an index-fund investor. It's crazy intimidating. Do I just start reading your investment bibles and leave my money on the sidelines until I understand how make investment decisions in individual companies?

tldr2; I am questioning the fundamentals of my buy-and-hold index fund approach to investing. What the hell do I do?

I like everything I've read about the ""smart contract"" aspect. I don't buy into the idea of these craptogrsphic currencies being either currencies or stores of value (digital gold) but I'm very sold by the utility.

Not really. It was initially flat from 2014 through 2017, when it showed decent gains , then flattened out again. This is after a career's worth of mostly dismal performance on previous funds.

The only way you can support that 30% figure is if you include 2020, but of course 1) a crack-smoking chimp could have made amazing gains in 2020, 2) ARK massive gains in 2020 are in large part due to Cathie creating meme stocks such as TSLA through pumping in media appearances etc., 3) ARK massive gains are in part due to misleading statements made ('nuff said), and 4) she hasn't kept up the stellar performance, much the opposite.",,

Eventually, Buffett did finally get a slot on his firm.  And by his mid-thirties he was closing up Buffett Partners Ltd. to acquire a failing textile business which continued to underperform into the late 70's.   It wasn't until Black Monday (the market crash of 1987) that Buffett's Berkshire-Hathaway went into the stratosphere.

But let's take a step back... Buffett was an exceptionally shrewd person and if we say he purchased his first securities at age 11, and he ran a coin operated soda machine business which was arguably more lucrative, then he had 23 years of business experience before acquiring Berkshire-Hathaway and would have to wait another 23 years after that before it became truly successful.

And even then, he has famously said it was his biggest error, for if instead of acquiring the whole textile business he had directly invested the acquisition cost in insurance businesses, he would be $200 billion richer.

>A typical undergrad degree is way too slow for me

What Buffett had that you don't is not just an education and expertise, but immense patience.

If your issue is that you're too old, then accept that you cannot be all things.  You've obviously had a career.  You've made money that has given you investment capital.  Put it in an index fund.  You will not beat it.  You will not learn what you need to know to beat it in the time you have left, even if you put every hour of family time and personal enjoyment aside.

Op Cash is good but relatively flat last 3yr. 


Shareholder equity is 1/5th of what it was 5yr ago. But don’t worry. The dividend!!! 


BV / share is falling past 5yr. 

ROE and Roa falling except 2020 anomaly year. 


Margins falling dramatically except 2020


NI falling except 2020 


Revenue flat or falling except up 4% 2020. 


Payout ratio is high at almost 80%. Fumble a bit more and dividend will be cut.

In an AC system you have reactance which can go in either direction: IIRC, inductive reactance makes the current lag behind the voltage and capacitive reactance pushes it forward. When these are offset across the phases it has the same net effect as resistance in the grid itself which can significantly lower overall efficiency. Anything with a coil such as electric motors or the ballasts in fluorescent lights causes inductive reactance. I'm not sure what causes capacitive reactance these days, but old CRT TVs and monitors used to do it. The two types of reactance cancel each other out though, and certain times of day put different reactance loads on the grid. Factory motors starting up at 7am vs office monitors starting up at 9am. So, massive capacitor banks are used to balance out inductive reactance. Sorry if the explanation is a bit rusty, I have not worked in that field since the 80's.",,
