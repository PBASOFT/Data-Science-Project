11,,2021-05-22 22:24:04,t3_nito33,,StockMarket,"Ally Financial (ALLY) has recently gained some popularity over the past few years. They have 2 main streams of revenue, personal banking and auto financing. 

I'm personally drawn to this stock because of the personal banking. I bank with Ally and I really like it so far. Great saving rates, no fees, super user friendly app, great customer service, etc. What's interesting is they don't have physical locations. At first I was concerned about this, but, I haven't ran into issues. 

To my knowledge the personal banking is relative new and growing. Recently they have entered into the investing world as well. I'm sure this will increase their onboarding. 

They seem to have a good culture, the valuation is attractive considering the smaller size and growth, and they offer a dividend. Overall I like the company. 

I think this could be a big win in a few years if they keep onboarding users. Ally is a ""cool new bank"" that is attractive to the younger generation. I understand doubling the user base will not happen over night but I can see consistent growth.

To get an idea of their size relative to other big banks, I'll list a few market caps of well known banks and Ally's below:

ALLY: 20B

WFC: 190B

BAC: 363B

C: 160B

JPM: 492B

Questions that I have:

The savings rates for Ally are higher than many other banks, how do they accomplish that? Lower margins?

Can they actually compete against the ""big banks""?

Do they operate differently? If so, how?

What are the main risk for this company?

&#x200B;

Any other info would be greatly appreciated!",nito33,"ALLY Financial (ALLY) verse traditional banks (BAC, WFC, C, etc)"

they drive the price down, invest during the bottom of the dip (which they control by selling en masse and creating FUD), and then create new laws regulating it to make it seem ""safer"", releasing new greener tech, new alt coins, banks begin accepting it under strict regulations and ""low"" fees,  which brings people back in. three years from now at the all time peak of crypto to date, they do it all over again. each time chipping away at the core of the crypto ideal by adding new laws and increasing the difficulty for the average miner or investor to make a profit, leaving massive manipulation (much like the stock market) in the hands of the rich and ultra rich. all the while we are drip fed stories of lucky teens turning lunch money into millions.

While we have all heard of the chlorine shortage, I am convinced we have incorrectly concluded the cause for the shortage. It is my belief that as a result of COVID overwhelming the entire healthcare industry (especially hospitals), the product that healthcare relies on most (chlorine and chlor alkali) became overwhelmed as a result. The true cause of this shortage is simply the effect of the overwhelming strain this pandemic placed on the entire healthcare industry. Information below helps provide clarity on how vital chlor alkali is to the healthcare industry.   

#### [Chlorine: On the ""Front Line"" in Hospitals¬Æ (americanchemistry.com)](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Chlorine/Front-Line/)  

#### Chlorine and Life-Saving Drugs 

From the computers used in admissions to the sutures used in surgeries, chlorine is a vital part of hospital operations and patient treatments. In fact, probably no other institution relies as much on chlorine as hospitals. Hospital pharmacies are full of medications that rely on chlorine chemistry. Today, about 85 percent of all pharmaceuticals contain or are made using chlorine, including medications that treat heart disease, hypertension, cancer, AIDS, arthritis, pneumonia, depression, diabetes, allergies, meningitis, glaucoma, osteoporosis and ulcers.

Acetaminophen, the most widely used pain reliever in hospitals, is made with chlorine. Sodium chloride is also used in every COVID vaccine.

Chlorine and Medical Equipment

Chlorine is essential to a wide variety of hospital equipment. An estimated 25 percent of all medical devices in hospitals are made using chlorine, including some of the most widely used equipment:

¬∑ IV and blood bags. Chlorine-based plastics are used to make the millions of blood and IV bags used by hospitals and blood banks each year. 

 

* Sterile tubing       and packaging. Chlorine-based plastics are also used to make these       essential devices.  

Premier Infection-Fighter

Chlorine compounds are used widely to maintain hospital cleanliness and prevent thousands of life-threatening infections. As a bleach and medicinal aid, chlorine compounds:

¬∑ Prevent bacterial contamination of patients' burns and wounds

¬∑ Disinfect kidney dialysis machines

¬∑ Clean and disinfect work surfaces and equipment in medical laboratories

¬∑ Kill deadly bacteria, such as Legionnaire's Disease, that can live in hospital water and air conditioning systems.

Chlorine in the Operating Room

Chlorine plays a number of critical roles in the operating room:

¬∑ *Anesthesia.* Anesthetics, such as Anactine Flopak, are made with chlorine.  
 General cleaning and disinfection. Infections are a significant threat in hospitals. Chlorine-based cleansers disinfect work surfaces and equipment.

¬∑ *Sutures and other surgical equipment.* Chlorine helps make nylon, an essential material in surgical sutures, artificial blood vessels and osmotic membranes. And vinyl, a chlorine-based plastic, is used in heart catheters.

 

* *Electronic       instruments.* Computers       and electronic devices play an increasingly important role in the       operating room and hospital patient care, and chlorine provides one of       the crucial building blocks in the manufacture of semiconductors used in       these life-saving electronic instruments.‚Äù

It‚Äôs obvious that chlorine plays an irreplaceable role in healthcare and the safety of our healthcare workers, and safety has never been more crucial than during COVID. It is my belief that to ensure safety for healthcare workers and availability of chlorine dependent products used in healthcare, Biden used the Defense Production Act to require companies that produce critical chlor alkali raw materials to prioritize production for the healthcare industry and combatting COVID.

[The Defense Production Act and the Biden Administration ‚Äì Publications | Morgan Lewis](https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2021/02/insight-the-defense-production-act-and-the-biden-administration-first100) 

### BIDEN ADMINISTRATION‚ÄôS EXPECTED USE OF THE DPA

&#x200B;

* The      Biden administration has publicly stated that it intends to use the DPA to      combat the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the administration is likely      to use the DPA to accelerate COVID-19-related supply chains.
* The      administration has identified 12 categories of critical supplies that will      accelerate the manufacture, delivery, and administration of COVID-19      vaccines.
* The      six vaccine candidates being developed as part of Operation Warp Speed, as      well as companies manufacturing COVID-19 therapeutics, have priority DPA      ratings.
* On      January 21, 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order that      directs federal agencies to use all available legal authorities, including      the DPA, to fill supply shortfalls that are critical to the COVID-19      pandemic response.

With chlor alkali producers being forced to prioritize chlorine based raw material production for the healthcare industry and COVID pandemic, all other industries dependent on chlor alkali have been left behind to experience a complete lack of the same raw materials. The impacts are detailed below.

The computer chip shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here‚Äôs how: [Trichlorosilane: Cornerstone Chemical for Electronics and High-Tech Toys (americanchemistry.com)](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Science-Center/Chlorine-Compound-of-the-Month-Library/Trichlorosilane-Cornerstone-Chemical-for-Electronics-and-High-Tech-Toys/)

Silicon chlorides are some of the cornerstone chemicals of the Information Age. Trichlorosilane (HSiCl3) is an intermediate compound used to produce extremely pure silicon, from which computer chips, the ""brains"" of electronic devices and high-tech toys, are manufactured. The famous high-tech industrial area of California, Silicon Valley, was named for the chemical element that has revolutionized the way we communicate and play. And chlorine has played an essential role in the high-tech revolution.

The aluminum shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here‚Äôs how:  [Aluminum Chloride | Aluminum Sulfate | Aluminum Manufacturers](https://www.aluminummanufacturers.org/aluminum-sulfate/aluminum-chloride/) ‚Äì Chlorine based chemical used primarily in the production of aluminum metal. Chlorine is also used in the recycling of aluminum.

According to **EuPC Managing Director Alexandre Dangis***, ‚ÄúManufacturers of plastic products all over Europe are experiencing serious bottlenecks in the supply of raw materials since the beginning of this year. Delivery problems have become increasingly widespread, affecting raw materials for example (not limited) such as Polypropylene, Polyvinyl Chloride, and Polyethylene, as well as special additives that are crucial for the manufacture of compounds and plastic products. The serious market disruptions currently taking place all over Europe are a symptom of the structural imbalance in Europe between the local production of and demand for raw materials and additives. Without restoration of that balance, periodic recurrence of gross disruption of the production chain is highly likely.*

*All of the 3 raw materials mentioned above are chlorine based.* 

The cat food shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here‚Äôs how:   [Functions and Requirements of Chlorine in Cats | Pet Care Advisors](https://petcareadvisors.com/cats/functions-and-requirements-of-chlorine-in-cats/) ‚Äì Chlorine is used in cat food as they are highly attracted to it.

With this information, it is my belief that chlor alkali manufacturers will continue to experience overwhelming demand nearly impossible to satisfy for the next 2 years plus. This demand will of course create record breaking revenues and profit margins for the industry. As the largest chlor alkali producer in the world, Olin Corporation (ticker symbol $OLN) is in perfect position to reap the most reward. I am highly confident that gross revenue / net profits will significantly exceed expectations for all of 2021, 2022 and likely 2023.

181,,2021-05-23 00:58:34,t3_niwj6i,,StockMarket," Hi all,

I‚Äôm hoping for some advice. I‚Äôm a 26-year-old (M) from the US ‚Äì single/no kids.

I  recently had a small manic episode where I bought over 3 Ethereum for  around $4k each as well as 0.1 BTC for $5,557. After seeing the crypto  prices drop quite a bit, I decided to try to get my average cost per ETH  down by buying another 1.5 ETH for $2500 (average cost per ETH is now  around $3500), with the hopes of it briefly rebounding so I could sell  and breakeven - but now it is dipping more.

I  attached a picture of a few charts that I made. Currently, I have  around $106k cash (sitting in 2 checking accounts) and \~$40.5k in a  traditional 401k retirement account. On top of that, my crypto holdings  are currently valued around $14,000 (from an initial investment of  $21k).

In terms of financial goals  ‚Äì I would like to buy a home or townhouse sometime in the next 12-15  months. I make around $130k/year and have virtually no expenses ‚Äì I live  at home with my parents- rent free and I own a 3-year-old car and my  motorcycle outright. I have managed to pay my student loans off  entirely. My monthly expenses for car & motorcycle insurance, food,  cell phone, and gym membership total around $550 per month. With all  this in mind‚Ä¶ I live in one of the top five most expensive  cost-of-living states and will be a buying as a single-income/single  occupant homeowner. I also don‚Äôt own any furniture or any appliances, so  I will have to purchase everything when I do finally get my own place.

I  guess I really have no idea what I‚Äôm doing with cash and investments.  Selling now and losing $7k would really stink. I know I can ‚Äúrealize‚Äù my  losses and write them off my tax liability, but knowing that I lost  $4500 would be rough to swallow, but holding and losing $21k would be  worse.

I really like what ETH is  doing with sharding and proof-of-stake to reduce energy consumption. I  think it has some kind of future, even recent news coming from foreign  countries, but I don‚Äôt want this to interfere with my future home buying  and comfort.

I‚Äôm really lost here.

tl;dr:

I‚Äôm  not na√Øve ‚Äì I know there are winners and losers in every market, but  how does one know when to just cut their losses and sell?  Is this just a  relatively inexpensive lessen in speculative investing that I should  just take on the chin?

Apparently a post here has to have a certain character count. Crossposting isn‚Äôt allowed and I can‚Äôt even seem to be able to share a screenshot of the previous post. So the above is a link to the original post stuck up on an obscure subreddit because they were the only place I could find where I was able to actually post it.

The rest of this post is just basically me typing additional characters so that I will be able to post here.

I know that this isn‚Äôt technically a high effort post. But I‚Äôm somewhat proud of the fact that I called it when I did. Despite the fact that hordes of people tried to convince me otherwise.

The reason I came up with the prediction was just from overlapping that famous hype/mania graph overtop of Bitcoin and realizing that they lined up almost perfectly. So perfectly that I initially thought it was comical. However now it isn‚Äôt really so funny. The only reason that I was looking into crypto was because I was planning to buy some Bitcoin. I saw it was levelling off and I decided that it wasn‚Äôt an optimum time to buy. Especially with the recent media hype.

But then I looked at that chart and every single step listed in the chart Bitcoin had gone through.

Takeoff, first sell off, bear trap, media attention, enthusiasm, greed, delusion, the nee paradigm was obvious from the adds I kept getting trying to sell me crypto wallets, we were just hitting the denial phase.

Since then we have hit the bull trap and the return to normal. 

The only things left are fear, capitulation and despair. We are currently in the capitulation phase I think.

So I am not going to be buying Bitcoin until we return to the mean which just by eyeballing the chart looks like it‚Äôs sitting around $15,000.",nix87a,"Looks like my just for fun prediction from 28 days ago (Bitcoin from $65,000 to $15,000) might actually pan out :("

This past week NASDAQ, 500, etc along with all the ETFs tracking them show a peak and then a down. If that down continues with more bad news then expect at least a large correction. But a crash is not out of the question.

Cryptocurrencies spread the power horizontally instead of vertically like the current system. ‚ÄúFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned about potential risks cryptocurrencies pose to the financial system‚Äù- I don‚Äôt think anyone besides the super-rich and the people at the top of financial institutions think the current financial system is working. Unless you are one of these people, which is like 0.000001%, you should be on the side of cryptocurrency. I know that change is scary and a change that is as big as the opportunity cryptocurrency is offering to the human race is uncertain but this could be the biggest advance in the history of technology that gives power to the masses of not just one country but the entire world. These huge governments (China, United States, Russia) that are currently trying to scare people with news of regulations and crackdowns on cryptocurrency are not doing this for the good of people, they are doing this because they know, like we know, that cryptocurrency is the biggest threat to their power and money than anything ever before. The whole blockchain movement is so young and is growing faster than ever, the more people learn about it and get involved is beneficial to everyone. I truly see this technology changing the world for the better (in a way the internet did) and the people who have the most money and the true power in this world do not want this.

317,gz4nqli,2021-05-23 04:21:18,t1_gz4nqli,t3_ni1z8t,StockMarket,"Ok I'm back. You asked me to compare vs your initial target. Again, I will lead with my last comment which is that since none of us know your intended goals, financial aptitude, or desire to actively manage a portfolio, then we cant provide any meaningful recommendations.

For example, I would have very different feedback depending on whether or not you intend to actively manage the portfolio or just buy and forget for 30 years. Specifically, there are certain opportunity sets based on the current market climate (value, international/emerging, small cap) that look very appealing compared to broader market exposure, and doing an overweight tilt in those directions \*could\* yield alpha. BUT, in the same way that current dislocations have made those opportunities attractive to buy, at some point in the future they will be more attractive to sell -- if you don't want to (or cant) manage your portfolio actively, then it doesn't make sense to tilt like that and holding broader market funds is definitely the solution. 

Let's make a few assumptions....let's assume you have a decent understand of markets/economics, intend to maintain moderately active as far as managing your portfolio, and have a high risk tolerance, and maybe most importantly you don't need this money within the next 5-10 years for a major purchase, emergency, etc.  

Given the above, here is my feedback:

\- Way too much s&P exposure. While it feels good now because it has been going straight up for 20 years, the s&P is at record valuations by almost every metric. And yes I know, interest rates, and this and that and \*insert excuse here\*. The fact is that price and time are the two largest determinants of return. If you buy at a bad price it's going to be ugly. Historical 10yr equity returns at current valuations are around 1-2% real. S&P has basically become a large cap tech index -- listen to any intelligent market commentary right now and basically everybody agrees that large cap US tech is the most richly valued asset class right now. No thanks. 

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/xyk4Lmzq/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/xyk4Lmzq/)

\- International developed and EM are currently way cheaper than the US. Personally I have 60% of my 401k going into international markets right now (10% going to s&P although I do have another account about the same size with much more US exposure). There are lots of good ETFs to get broad exposure that range from simple (ie: IEMG, or VXUS) to more complex (IVLU, EYLD). Technically, EM chart is looking beautiful right now too. As you can see in the first chart, US has basically gone parabolic since 2000....as you can see below, EM has been range bound and is JUST starting to break out. 

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/8YMv8wlX/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/8YMv8wlX/)

\- Value. Not much to say here besides the fact that buying cheaper assets while everything is inflated seems like an obviously preferential option. Value has been DEAD for the last 20 years but these sorts of risk factors have historically always mean reverted. This first chart below is vanguard value index (vtv) vs ndx (nasdaq)....basically value vs growth. Value has underperformed growth by around 70% since 2005. 

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/KOft8Cme/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/KOft8Cme/)

\- Buy equal weight instead of cap weighted. This is just something to think about generally as it does make a difference. Small caps have a different return profile than large caps (generally higher but more volatile) so if your goal highest growth possible, then you would want to hold equal weight indexes (instead of cap weight) and effectively overweight small/mid caps (that ""overweight"" is on a relative basis compared to the cap weight benchmark). 

\- The value factor is proven to exhibit itself more strongly in small cap stocks. In this moment (as size and value risk factor have been out of favor for 10-20 years), it's looking like small cap value will have a pretty strong run of outperformance over s&p.

\- Why are you holding gold? I assume just to diversify or inflation hedge? Why not also buy a commodities index and/or TIPS? I like metals/commodities right now but this is definitely a VERY cyclical asset class and will require some degree of ""timing"" or sell discipline in the next 3-5-10 years. Generally, the cyclicality of these assets is what causes them to underperform equities on a long term basis, but that doesn't mean that there aren't periods of opportunity (like now). 

&#x200B;

I realize that was a lot that I just typed up there....and a lot of reference to fairly dense academic concepts. My point is just that there are a lot of good opportunities in the markets right now but you need to be slightly contrarian if you want to take advantage of them. 

If I were to make very quick recommendations:

\- take 30% of the 64% s&P exposure and put it into a int developed ETF 

\- opt for a value tilted s&P etf instead of just the s&P (there are tons of options). 

\- Add small cap value US Tilt (SLYV) 

\- If you really want to go out on a limb, look for small and or value funds for the international exposure Ie something like EYLD or AVDV. 

&#x200B;

If you want to lean more on any of that, do some googling on risk factors, Fama-French factor investing, etc. Also, this guy Ben Felix provides the best videos (that I have found) on these acemic concepts.....he has a TON of really good content and breaks down the pillars of academic investing theory.

like bro I'm fucking NEW. first off I never asked about crypto and second off shut up. we all know about crypto. we know. we get it. but here's the thing. telling new investors to ""just buy bitcoin it's the future!11!11"" is how you make people lose money. 

hopping on trends and putting your money on a literal fad/trend like bitcoin (I feel like the hype is more emotional than logical), is literally just the most ignorant thing ever. on top of that crypto goes 24/7 and is super volatile. meaning you could buy ethereum, see a +.05% profit, and go to bed. you wake up and since you're new and don't even know stop losses exist, you wake up and see that it dropped significantly in such a short amount of time. 

as a new investor you're more likely to panic sell here. on top of that, if you try to HODL thinking it'll go up, if you put money in something like a fad/trend because ""bro it's the future!!1!11"" and people dip out the trend, it only goes more and more down. 

telling new people to invest in such a highly volatile and scary thing, especially when stuff like doge which felt like a fad in the first place, is beyond aggravating.

I have never known states not exercise more power over people when they could. And unless we suddenly exist in a stateless world, this idea of blockchain being a future we should want is a bit terrifying. 

&#x200B;

Unregulated currencies are likely to remain niche, and regulated currencies are likely to allow for monitoring on a level never before seen. Every $ you will spend will be observed, recorded, and used to measure what kind of person you are. Every decision will be measured against known predictors for obedience and compliance, and where your decisions are seen as subservice, you will either be denied access to things, or will have to pay more for the same thing. A sort of collective wide cronyism will be tacitly supported by reward ""good"" behaviour, and punishing ""bad"" behaviour. 

&#x200B;

It'll be dressed up as for our own protection, as reductions in liberties always are. We'll be told it reduces tax evasion to zero, that it makes funding for crimes close to impossible, and that if you've done nothing wrong, you've nothing to fear. 

&#x200B;

You, and optimists like you, fail to grasp realities of the world we exist in. Blockchain technology is far more likely to bring shackles to our souls than be path to a utopian future. 

&#x200B;

If you think I'm being a bit dramatic, look at China's Social Index Score, where you'll be denied mortgages if you associate with known subversives, and be unable to get your kids into good schools if your credit score is too low.

Personally, I would probably HODL to your existing stake and not add more. 

&#x200B;

I equate this to capital protection and not throwing good money after bad. You've ringfenced a potential max loss. If that figure is too big for you, you consider consider selling some to limit your maximum loss still further. 

&#x200B;

This isn't a lecture, but from experience. I made some mistakes with stocks, and was usually glad for not averaging down. I only averaged down with DMYD (SPAC) who became GENI, once they started winning major contracts. I only averaged down with GAN once they produced some numbers that mostly matched their guidance, having refused the previous QTR when the results were dreadful, and was prepared to jump ship with a 40% loss had another QTR of dreadful results occurred. I've lost count of the ""small"" bets on speculative stocks I eventually sold out of because most went nowhere or went down double digits.

When investing goes into speculating, it's on you to either resist that temptation, or to limit your exposure.

Revenue climbed to 135.3 billion yuan ($21 billion) in the three months ended March, compared with the average 133.8 billion yuan of estimates. Net income came in at 47.8 billion yuan, versus 28.9 billion yuan a year earlier.

Its changing in crypto to be sure.... but its still mainly buying the concept of future potential of what might be delivered to the market place once the road map goals get fulfilled. 

I see crypto as more akin to angel investing. Where you take on increased risk to get in early before a working business has been created and in exchange for that increase risk you can get high profit returns. But that risk might play out as out of 12 projects, 10 go belly up for a variety of reasons but 2 hit it out of the park and make it worthwhile. 

The biggest problem with crypto is a LOT of people invest in projects based on the name/whatever is trending on social media or some other vague concept they have that governs how they choose a project to put their money in! With zero understanding what the project is or if it has a hope in hell of delivering anything! 

Would likely have better results writing all the names on the ground, cutting a chickens head off and wherever it drops YOLO your life savings into that 1. 

Full disclosure, I've invested and continue to hold in about 25 crypto projects and say as someone willing to invest in the sector that its a train wreck in so many ways!

I have started to invest in crypto in 2015 when i was just a kid, excited about the technology behind crypto. I knew nothing, i was a noob. I made insane amounts of money and i lost it all. I experienced the whole rollercoaster. And I've learned a lot. I learned to manage these swings, to do my DD and to be confident in myself, my decisions and to accept the consequences. After years of trading crypto, i found out about stocks and compounding interest and ETFs, the usual stuff discussed on this sub. Coming from crypto to stocks was such an easy and smooth transition! I am very grateful that i started with crypto, took all the risk when i was young and inexperienced, lived it all, pumps 10000% in a few months and dumps of 99% in a few days. Then i got into stocks, now knowing exactly what i am doing for a change. And it is so damn easy. I see people freaking out when they're 50% down on their portfolio and i just chuckle and remember warmly my wild time in crypto... I accepted that i can't time the market. I know how to do a solid DD. I buy companies that i believe in. And i hold. I didn't sell anything during the covid crash, in fact, i threw more money in the market than usually. I love dips now. The bigger the better. Because i know my DD and current price of a stock doesn't matter to me too much. I know where a company is heading (after my DD) and that if i think that a stock is worth 100 now, will be worth a 1000 in 10 years, but tomorrow drops to 50, that is a great thing happening to me! This dip just multiplied my future profits, i love it! So, all I'm saying is that i started trading crypto without knowing anything and it was the best lesson i could have asked for. It led to me being confident and i dare to say good in investing in various areas, including stocks and crypto. And yes, i still hold a lot of Bitcoin and ETH since when i was a kid. And even after several ~90% dumps, those are still my best investments. And if you want to know my opinion on those now, well, lets say that i do not intend to sell those for ANY price within next 10 years. I wouldn't sell a single BTC even if BTC was now worth 10 million dollars. I'm not trying to push any investment. I like crypto as well as ETFs and stocks.

The point of crypto is that it will be used one day instead of real money is it not? I belive it will and I belive only bitcoin and etherium have a chance at that at this moment in time and so I belive only those two have ""long term value"". Doge, ADA, etc... all of those wont see adoption and wont grow as much IMO. 

But the thing is that if what I'm saying is true, the fact still is that these crypto currencies are seeing a 10%+ price movement per day so daytrading is extremly profitable... IF YOU'RE LUCKY. Because day trading these crypto currencies IMO, is no different to gambling at the end day and new investors don't see that.

 There are so manny new investors in crypto IMO that's an obvious sign of a bubble (one of manny signs). All my friends got into crypto in the last 2 months.

I just had exposure to the stock market prior to crypto so I transferred the same metrics over when researching what I'm looking to invest in.

Its just a different asset class at the end of the day that is still in its infancy so carries increased risk as its not a mature sector with all the information easily accessible.

That already is a certain amount of fomo and forces you to question your original thesis.  While your friends buy an institutionally cratered cryptocurrency, you can definitely do some research and root in some great longs you can show your kids in time. Now is the time to definitely find a few companies that are rich in cash and ""not cool"" to new investors.  Personally loving Lowe's, Target, DG, MSFT, all of these ""boring"" boomer stocks that don't ""moon.""

I'm pretty new too.  It's been weird because all my friends know me as the financials guy, as they all made money for the past two months and I kept DCA'ing my favorite longs, staying stagnant more or less.  I'm not too confrontative, but I decided to speak my mind at least at the crucial time last week to maybe reconsider the story, As they are invested in crypto with zero financial background to maybe consider an ETF or reinvest in securities, they're holding and not missing out on the ""rip,"" so.",,

Do your own research is always good advice. One tactic I use is to think of something where value could exist and then do some research as well as seeing what more experienced traders are saying. If it stacks up I will buy. My best buy is one I found this way. It's an energy stock called peabody energy. The ticker is btu. Don't be put off when I tell you it is a coal miner. Coal is hated right? Sure, that's why btu was 45 dollars five years ago and about 6 dollars now. Yesterday's fuel? Sure, that's the narrative in the West, but in the east they are building new coal fire stations today lots of them in China and India. Coal miners like btu suffer because banks won't touch them... But this is good for btu because some miners went bankrupt leaving more market for btu. Heard of the commodity supercycle? Well coal is the last commodity to join it, but prices of coal are now at a high. But this is not reflected in the btu shape price... Yet. Because   pension funds don't want to be seen in fossil fuels, that means small investors can take advantage of the high coal prices by buying the coal miners while they are still rock bottom but about to hit it big on coal prices. Don't take my word for it, look up btu on twitter and on peabody energy website. Smarter guys than me say its going to 30 dollars in the next 2 years.

At its most basic, Bitcoin has become to all of crypto, what gold is to the dollar. But Bitcoin is just a single coin of many. Yes, there are coins who‚Äôs value is purely based on ‚Äúhype‚Äù, and yes supply and demand is the number one value correction for crypto but, there‚Äôs only a handful of legit coins that can be used the same way Bitcoin can. Some coins are earned by allowing your computer to be a node on a blockchain. Some coins are used as ‚Äúexchange‚Äù coins which allow you to acquire coins that aren‚Äôt listed on a major app. Some coins are used to allow instant fee-less transfers to the other side of the world. Celo allows you to take your countries currency, turn it into Celo, and send it to India in the space of a few minutes. The person in India can then change it over to their own fiat. The idea of crypto is to remove the financial institutions ability to control and monetize it, for the most part. It‚Äôs not for everyone, because it is very volatile but, it is still in its infancy. It will become more stable as time carries on. This will be the way our grandchildren make their wealth. It‚Äôs a way that anyone, who does their research and doesn‚Äôt expect to get rich overnight, can provide themselves a level of comfort that stocks can‚Äôt provide until much further down the road. Stocks are ultimately more controlled by the ‚Äúguys up top‚Äù than crypto. And there is value in long term investment in crypto, if you‚Äôve done your DD. The problem is you shouldn‚Äôt be checking your money and selling the next day. With stocks that happens all the time because a company goes under or doesn‚Äôt show enough growth.

It's also value that I can transfer to anyone in the world, peer to peer with no intermediaries, almost instantly on the most secure network ever created. It's censorship resistant, so I can send/receive without being blocked by opposing or corrupt interests. Our traditional financial system based on technology from the 60s is no match for BTC. The days of waiting 5 business days for ACH to clear will be remembered like the way we remember fax machines. The days of having to drive to a Western Union or a bank (9-5 weekdays only) and paying 20% fees to send remittances are over.

The fact that you're unable put a price on one of the most revolutionary inventions in human history is a problem derived from your own ignorance. Metcalfe's Law can be applied to value BTC, where its valuation is proportional to the square of the number of nodes (users) in the system. You can choose to continue living in the stone age, but BTC network effects grow by hundreds of thousands daily. All across the world, especially in countries with hyperinflation and failing economies, people are seeking refuge in cryptocurrencies. It's easy for privileged sciolists in first world countries to shit on BTC as ""speculative"", when it's actually serving underbanked people all across the globe as we speak.

Your last paragraph has to be one of the most ridiculous things I've read in months. Imagine thinking fiat currencies have ""fundamentals"". They're backed by literally nothing, and monetary policy is a joke. Have you looked at the M1 money stock chart lately? It looks like a backwards L. Fractional reserve banking is also not a thing with BTC. Every BTC can be accounted for. It's also laughable to think you actually think that digital currency is a poor means of exchange, and that physically handling pieces of paper around is superior. LMAO.

P.S. yes you can earn yield with cryptocurrencies. It's called DeFi.",,

Money is a social contract, that lowers the cost of trading and has evolved gradually through time.

Buy what you understand. Meaning, companies in a sector which you can comprehend.

Make a system, a collection of questions you want answered while looking through their earnings report.

Financials tells the investor almost everything he needs. P/E is helpful but doesnt determine a buy or sell, its usually sector specific or depending on the growth potential of the company.

Don't believe the hype, this is the investor killer. Always!

Profit growth over 5 years, good thing. Means the company is doing well.

Not issuing more shares, also good. Not necessary, it depends when the company issues more shares and why.

Share buybacks, usually good unless the company is significantly overvalued.

Managable debt, shouldn't burn a hole in their pocket.

Dividend is nice but not a must. A healthy combination of growth and dividend stocks usually helps over the longrun, since you're increasing the amount of money put into the market YoY or over quarters. A nice line from Sven Carlin (i believe, shoot me if im wrong), you can eat dividends, you cant eat growth. Pretty much means you can purchase things with dividends (more shares for example). 

Free cashflow, dunno why this shit landed way down here but this is pretty much critical, free cashflow goes to development, buying back shares, paying down debt, basically everything. Expanding their business, promoting products, product development. You name it, this is the bag of cash they can use. Ebitda is bs, they cant use money they have to amortorize or tax. Right? Makes sense. 

Hope this helped, I'm ready to get whipped if people think I'm wrong. But this is my opinions and I'm very aware that I can be wrong and I can learn.",,

1. Don‚Äôt panic sell- just because a stock has a bad day don‚Äôt panic sell and lose your money. If you truly believe in your stock, it will go back up.
2. Starting out invest in ETF‚Äôs- this is probably the thing I wish I could‚Äôve been told. ETF‚Äôs are like and mutual fund but you can buy it anytime during the day. They r a safe way to consistently make money. They won‚Äôt lose you money(if you pick a good one) in the long run.

4. Stay away from options- some new investors may not know what it is and it should stay that way. It is the equivalent of gambling. 
5.crypto- crypto is very volatile and u could lose your whole investment in a day. I wouldn‚Äôt say you shouldn‚Äôt invest in crypto, but be smart. Also don‚Äôt buy DOGE it‚Äôs literally a meme.
6. Don‚Äôt invest money that your aren‚Äôt prepared to lose- the stock market is unpredictable sometimes. A new pandemic could occur or a world war could breakout or another Great Depression could happen.

This tweet may be a tease but we all know what they‚Äôre trying to tell us.[ South Korea was the top destination for US LNG exports in September 2020!](https://twitter.com/lngglobal/status/1328389385872498689?s=20)

What is Tellurian?

Tellurian was founded in 2016 by two industry icons, Charif Souki and Martin Houston. Charif set in motion the first liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports from the United States Lower 48 and founded Cheniere Energy. Martin originated the concept of LNG destination flexibility, ensuring that LNG became a commodity.

Tellurian is currently a debt-free company!

What is LNG?

[Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is natural gas that has been cooled down to liquid form for ease and safety of non-pressurized storage or transport. It takes up about 1/600th of the volume of natural gas in the gaseous state. LNG is odorless, colorless, non-toxic, and non-corrosive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquefied_natural_gas).

When LNG is returned to its gaseous state, it is used across the residential, commercial, and industrial sectors for purposes as diverse as heating, cooking, generating electricity, and manufacturing a wide variety of products. LNG is also used as a fuel for heavy-duty and other vehicles.

Who is Charif Souki?

To put it in simple terms‚Ä¶Charif Souki is the Elon Musk of LNG.

Charif co-founded Tellurian and serves as Executive Chairman of the Board. He also founded Cheniere Energy, Inc. in 1996 and served as Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and President until December 2015. Prior to Cheniere, Charif was an investment banker. He serves on the board of trustees of the American University of Beirut and as a member of the Advisory Board of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. Charif received a B.A. from Colgate University and an MBA from Columbia University.

[Charif Souki was the highest-paid CEO in 2013](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2014/04/29/does-cheniere-energys-ceo-really-deserve-142-million-annual-pay/?sh=40567db29c59); this proves that he‚Äôs the real deal. Charif Souki was voted out of his position at Cheniere by [Carl Icahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Icahn). Charif Souki was fired because he wanted to expand Cheniere with projects such as Driftwood whereas Carl wanted to spend their cash flows on dividends. Carl Icahn to date has never met Charif Souki in person.

Charif Souki resurrected his Driftwood plans by co-founding Tellurian.

What is Driftwood?

[Driftwood LNG LLC](http://driftwoodlng.com/), owned by Tellurian Inc., is developing a liquefied natural gas (LNG) production and export terminal on the west bank of the Calcasieu River, south of Lake Charles, Louisiana. Once complete, the terminal will be able to export up to twenty-seven million, six hundred thousand tonnes of LNG per year to customers worldwide.

Tellurian‚Äôs Team

The team at Tellurian together accounts for 75% of the LNG export from the USA today. In 2020; 5281 BCF of Natural Gas was exported from the USA. At current JKM (Asian Market) prices for June 2021, that is equivalent to around $37,508,302,500. At current TTF prices (European Market) prices for June 2021, that is equivalent to around $32,161,290,000. These numbers tell you that the team at Tellurian is no joke and should not be taken lightly.

The President & CEO of Tellurian, Oct√°vio Sim√µes brings 38 years of impressive energy industry experience to Tellurian‚Äôs remarkable infrastructure team. Previously, he was President and CEO of Sempra LNG & Midstream where he was responsible for all LNG and natural gas midstream activities in Sempra‚Äôs efforts to develop, build and operate liquefied natural gas (LNG) receipt terminals, liquefaction facilities, natural gas pipelines, and storage facilities. He led the company‚Äôs efforts at Cameron LNG, Energia Costa Azul LNG and Port Arthur LNG, where he focused on reliability of deliveries to customers, safety and gas sourcing strategies that assure reliable production of LNG. Oct√°vio has deep relationships in the LNG market and an unmatched tenacity for developing new projects.

Martin Houston the Vice Chairman and Co-founder is also an LNG veteran with nearly 40 years of experience. He‚Äôs managed all forms of enterprise in the energy industry, has established a strong external reputation in the international gas business, and is largely credited with being the key architect of BG Group‚Äôs world-class LNG business. In recognition of this, in 2011 he was the first recipient of the CWC LNG Executive of the Year award.

Why hasn‚Äôt Driftwood started construction yet?

The Driftwood project will cost $27.5 Billion including pipelines. Driftwood will produce 27.6 MTPA of LNG. Tellurian has been looking for Equity partners to help with the funding of Driftwood. Tellurian currently has one equity partner which is TOTAL SE. If FID for Driftwood isn‚Äôt reached by June 2021 then TOTAL can choose to back out of their position. If they choose to exit, it won‚Äôt be an issue for the company as Charif Souki[ ‚Äúsaid building the terminal is no longer dependent on the Total agreement.‚Äù](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/natural-gas/051221-tellurian-to-finish-commercialization-of-driftwood-lng-first-phase-in-few-weeks-souki) Tellurian currently has all permits required for Driftwood and Charif Souki confirmed that they are intending on starting basic construction this summer and planning on giving [Bechtel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechtel) the green light to begin full construction early next year.

What‚Äôs going on with commercial agreements?

In a [recent interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhmSef_1eUM) with [Citi Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citigroup), Charif Souki stated that ""We want to finish our commercial agreements, which will happen in the next few weeks,‚Äù Souki said the offering has been very popular and, if Tellurian hits its target in the next few weeks, would be oversubscribed.

A [recent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbQuICpNTYU) targeting Short Sellers was posted by Tellurian. Charif Souki asked the shorts ‚ÄúWhat do you think is going to happen when we start announcing some of these long-term commercial agreements that we‚Äôve been working on for so long? This will be an interesting question and we will see how the market reacts when this happens.‚Äù - We are the market and it‚Äôs our time to react.

Is TELL a quick trade or a long-term hold?

Charif Souki has made it [clear](https://youtu.be/kQn-eMCbjaM?t=727) that he is building a business and that TELL is not a trade. If you just want quick profits then this stock is NOT for you!

Tellurian‚Äôs Competition:

Although no one in the US will be able to come up with a business model more profitable than Tellurian‚Äôs Driftwood. Qatar in many people‚Äôs eyes is seen as a big competitor and one that will destroy all US LNG exports but this is simply just not the case. Countries that import LNG diversify their ‚ÄúLNG portfolio‚Äù and will buy from a variety of countries and not just anyone in particular. No matter how profitable Qatar‚Äôs LNG plan is; Success is almost inevitable for TELL. Charif Souki personally talked about this and with utmost respect reassures us that Qatar is not a competitor.

Stock Priceüìà:

Tellurian themselves have implied that the TELL stock will have a value of $12-$17 at FID! TELL is currently trading for $2.62! In the Citi Interview, Charif Souki said that the stock will have $7 FCF in a couple of years! The multiple for the FCF is decided by the market‚Ä¶ but is usually around 10x+!üöÄüöÄüöÄ

Institutional Owners: - [https://imgur.com/a/ssYRYfP](https://imgur.com/a/ssYRYfP)

State Street Corp recently disclosed that they added 20,783,999 shares adding to a grand total of 23,481,581 Shares. Blackrock and Vanguard own upwards of 13 million shares each!

Why am I invested in Tellurianü¶çü¶çüöÄüöÄ?

I am invested in Tellurian because I believe in the business model and also believe in the team. Charif Souki is a very intelligent man and Tellurian‚Äôs weekly ‚Äú2 minutes with Charif‚Äù videos keep investors up to date about what is going on with LNG throughout the world along with the occasional updates about Driftwood. $TELL has been through a lot these past few months but we have been setting high lows and higher highs last week which makes it appear as so we are in the ‚Äúc‚Äù or correction wave according to the [Eliott Wave Theory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/elliottwavetheory.asp). The fundamentals of this company haven‚Äôt changed and things are only getting better.

TELL Positions- [https://imgur.com/a/SpY4hAC](https://imgur.com/a/SpY4hAC)

I am long TELL.

**TL;DR -** Tellurian teased their agreement with South Korea earlier today and TELL is basically in a correction. The announcements of commercial agreements will help the stock reach a fair value. This is not your regular start-up company as the team has a shit ton of experience. With a highly profitable business model along with big connections in the business; Tellurian is lined up for success and is just waiting for the perfect time. Carl Icahn a short seller caused the highly respected Charif Souki to be fired from his own company and shorts are betting against his new company. It‚Äôs time to crumble the shorts. It‚Äôs time for the bulls to takeover!

**TL;DR of TL;DR -** Tellurian is a steal at the current price and you should buy as many shares as you can! The tutes are loading up so why aren‚Äôt you? It‚Äôs time Bulls! It‚Äôs time to crumble the shorts!

This SPAC is IPOE and the merger is with FinTech company SoFi. Brick and mortar banks and queuing in line for services is so 2019, in 2021 this process has become *digitized* and the goal is to have a bank in your *pocket*.

**Banks vs FinTech**

The expansion of financial services and cross-selling of them to existing customers has been a common strategy for traditional banks and finch companies alike. Traditional banks have a massive, already established customer base that they can easily cross sell other financial services to. In fact, the top 15 banks in the world control over 50% of all US bank accounts.

*Processing img rc5j1vtx9w071...*

&#x200B;

SoFi‚Äôs moat surrounds 3 different segments:

1. Lending: Personal/student loans and refinancing
2. Tech Platform: Galileo acquisition and payments infrastructure
3. Financial Services: Investing, credit cards, money transfers, etc

**Galileo**

I want to touch up on Galileo because SoFi‚Äôs acquisition of the company was highly strategic and has enabled them to integrate at a larger scale. Galileo is a B2B purchasing/payment platform that works with FinTech entities such as Robinhood, Chime, Monzo, and Revolut. With the Galileo platform, these companies can create complex financial payment processes and enable digital banking solutions. Think of Galileo as the infrastructure behind it all and they are growing by over 100% YoY.

**Trends & Growth**

So why don‚Äôt the banks just use their existing customer base to expand into the FinTech industry? Short answer: Because they are BOOMERS. The truth is their legacy infrastructure and IT costs do not help when transitioning into the FinTech space. As per Morgan Stanley, most FinTech startups can actually offer these services at nearly 50% cheaper than the traditional banks.

There are some tailwinds the industry is riding that ranges from more and more customers accessing banking services digitally (this number is even higher among millennials), rise in digital payments by over 20% from 2019 into 2020, and FinTech becoming increasingly popular among personal loans.

SoFi‚Äôs customer base has been growing at an average of 66% YoY with their last two quarters hitting 75% growth each. It is no doubt that the platform, the industry, and everything about the business is becoming increasingly popular. Management has noted by year-end 2021 they are expecting to hit over 3 million members (currently at 1.7 million).

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

What was mentioned above paints a picture that FinTech is disrupting traditional firms across all avenues of financial services (loans, investments, and banking). Traditional banks are failing to keep ahold of the new generation of customers coming into the market. SoFi is able to circumvent the inefficiencies in our current financial systems and provide unparalleled customer service for all their services.",njbfzs,The Weekly DD - SoFi: Powering the Future (FinTech)

This is where people are technically correct, but wrong when it comes to valuing crypto.

Bitcoin itself is limited. But there is no limit to how many copies of Bitcoin or competitors there can be. It's a world where a competitor can 100% copy McDonald's, and produce a product that is 100% identical. 

However, the new coin will have the advantage that a tiny percent of Bitcoin users will not own a ridiculously large amount of the coins. Bitcoin is less equal than North Korea. If people understood this, they wouldn't use it at all. Who wants to own an asset that can be devalued overnight when a single whale decides to cash out??? O, and we don't even know who the whales are. For all we know, we are enriching terrorists. 

One day, someone like Musk is going to make MarsCoin, copy the best coin out there (it isn't even Bitcoin now), and there will be zero reason to use Bitcoin original any longer.

What people miss is that ""Bitcoin"" is limited, but there is ZERO limit to the number of alternatives, and eventually one of them is going to be the Facebook to Bitcoin's MySpace.

Bitcoin really is doomed. The energy use is just not acceptable to the world in 2021.",,
