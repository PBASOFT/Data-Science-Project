Massive understatment. The community will never be what it was before. There is a mammoth sized amount of content to sift through that is absolute garbage posted by the second and unsurprisingly devolved the communities financial literacy from the low bar it already was. 

Now it's shorts this, hedgies that, just buzzwords fueled greatly by social bullshit and get rich quick pumps. With a whole global market out there, you just can't escape those people anymore on the sub.  We don't hate hedge funds or shorts, they were üåàüêª standing in way of the magnificent bull run. Fuck Burry was the best üåàüêª genius we all wanted to be. Finding something everyone else missed. But that culture clearly has changed. 

The only reason I checked this sub today is because of a text from my buddy about GME who I always used as a sell metric. Where do you go for GME? WSB. It's overrun. ""We"" aren't assholes, a lot of us lost a community as it morphed into something different from what it was. It sucks for us, but I get your feelings as you seemed to gain one. 

Ultimately it's not a good thing or bad thing, just a thing and I don't really give a shit. I know I stopped coming here and started interacting on other finance message boards more because of it. A lot of people did. Just know that saying it kinda took over is ridiculously understating it.",,

An exchange-traded fund that offers investors exposure to meme assets, and all the trending investments that social media has to offer, is making its debut on Wall Street.

Tuttle Capital Management‚Äôs FOMO ETF (FOMO -0.36%) will start trading on the Cboe Options Exchange (CBOE -0.27%) on Tuesday, providing the market with a new tool for leveraging the retail trading boom by investing in all the buzziest ‚Äúmeme stocks‚Äù and funds, from special-purpose acquisition corporations‚Äîknown by the acronym SPACs‚Äîto crypto-adjacent investments.

The fund‚Äôs ticker symbol is based on the popular acronym for ‚ÄúFear of missing out,‚Äù a widely shared sentiment on social media sites like Reddit, Twitter and Discord, where users live in fear of missing out on the latest trending investments, which could be in the midst of a parabolic move higher.

‚ÄúFOMO can shift exposure to whatever happens to be trending at the time,‚Äù Matthew Tuttle, the fund‚Äôs creator and Tuttle Capital CEO, said in a statement. ‚ÄúIt rebalances weekly so it can stay in harmony with market trends, and it weights holdings appropriately.‚Äù

The sudden rise and obvious power of the retail trading movement has created a new market dynamic with social-media activity now being used by some as a predictive tool for the movement of equities and other assets, most famously in popular stocks like GameStop (GME +16.34%) and AMC Entertainment (AMC +19.96%) which have come to exemplify the wild volatility of the retail investing scene.

Crypto have also grabbed the attention of individual investors as have some SPACs, the most notable being a large following for Bill Ackman‚Äôs Pershing Square Tontine Holdings (PSTH -1.43%). FOMO will offer crypto exposure by purchasing shares in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC -4.85%), among other investments that are pegged to crypto.

‚ÄúThe Covid lockdowns have energized the retail investor to look beyond traditional market-cap weighted index investments into the thematic space,‚Äù Tuttle said.

Of course, Tuttle‚Äôs ETF isn‚Äôt the only fund attempting to capitalize on Reddit-inspired investors. Back in March, VanEck launched the VanEck Vectors Social Sentiment ETF (BUZZ +0.55%), which said it would offer exposure to stocks with ‚Äúthe most bullish investor sentiment and perception.‚Äù 

Dave Portnoy, founder of Barstool Sports, is a shareholder in the company that created the index that underlies the VanEck fund.

Returns for BUZZ, referring to the ticker symbol for the VanEck social-sentiment ETF, have been less-than impressive. It is up 1.74% since its debut in March, compared against returns of at least 11% for the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA -0.24%) and the S&P 500 index (SPX -0.21%) and a gain of more than 7% for the Nasdaq Composite Index (COMP -0.03%).

FOMO‚Äôs expense ratio is 0.9%, which means its will cost an investor $9 in annual fees for every $1,000 invested. BUZZ‚Äôs expense ratio is 0.75%.",,

They're a good source of protein, environmentally friendly, they're crunchy, you can make bread with them, and cockroaches are fuckin sturdy.  Nuclear war?  No problem.  The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.  That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.  

And then the fuckin cicadas came.  Not a problem, right?  That happens reliably on 17 year cycles, should be priced in.  Except that they came *early*.  Nobody's talking about this but everyone in the cockroach community knows.  The rats have been feasting on these things.  It only takes them three weeks to breed.  And since the rat population is already booming, you retards can do the math.  Oh christ, they're going to be everywhere.  I already see them lurking in the grass.  We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  

You know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.  My wife and my wife's boyfriend left me at this point because I had not a penny to my name.  And you'd think they'd deliver 'em dead, right?  Nope!  Now I have literal tons of cockroaches crawling around my house and as a bonus they're attracting more rats cause apparently I'm not the only one who thinks they're a good source of protein.  And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.  

tl;dr I'm broke, I'm starving, my house is gone, and I'm probably gonna get eaten by rats.  Never, ever buy cockroach futures.",nk4z03,I am financially ruined and my life is hell thanks to cockroach futures

550,,2021-05-24 18:49:18,t3_nk56mr,,wallstreetbets,"So for those of you who aren't nerds that pay attention to military procurement and DoD fuckery, you might've missed the fact that the DoD is considering shelving the entire 10-billion dollar JEDI contract for the simple fact that the bidders are having an all out legal battle to see who deserves the contract. 

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn‚Äôt brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD‚Äôs Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> ‚ÄúWhile all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we‚Äôre risking is just different stovepipes,‚Äù Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. ‚Äú**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**‚Äù 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM‚Äôs Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

I can't really think of many stocks that are better than Opendoor. Lots of potential here and it's at the price it jumped to on DA. It is more than 50%+ off of its highs and I think it represents a great buying opportunity as of right now.

What are your thoughts on the quarter and what do you think its price target is for the coming year and long term?

Lordstown Motors options imply 22.5% move in share price post-earnings (TheFlyOnTheWall)

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 6 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is just about over, so there is a good chance that this is going to be the final spreadsheet until Q2 rolls around. Thank you all for joining me for the ride!

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles!

560,,2021-05-24 19:42:47,t3_nk6fnw,,wallstreetbets,"Well, the commodity market has been on fire. The question is... is that gonna continue? 
While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and copper for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc) 
I am long on TRQ .",nk6fnw,$TRQ and the Copper/Gold play

It seems to me that this is an important market indicator - if the CEO of a large company sells most of his stock or buys more, this indirectly determines the company's performance and the mood of employees. Of course, insider trading based on non-public information is illegal. However, when the company's employees buy or sell its shares in large quantities, it is completely legal and an important indicator of its affairs.

I‚Äôve been collecting information from Nasdaq and other official sources. Then I aggregated it by months and got two lists as a result - the first is the top 5 companies by insider buying activity and the second is Top 5 by Insider selling activity.

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Their next earnings are slated for 6/10/21 after market close.

I decided to retire this investment and use it to buy 500 shares of BNGO at about $5.54. I then sold 5 $6 June 18, covered calls for $245 premium which will cover my monthly hooker expense, for legal reasons that's a joke. Already I earned 70% of what QYLD would have payed me in a year.

 If my calls expire in the money then I'll make about a $300 profit for a total $545 profit in just one month. Then I'll just sell some cash covered puts then rinse and repeat. If the calls expire OTM then it's another monthly covered calls. I truly believe in BNGO which is why I have about 200 other calls on the side for the long term.

The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don‚Äôt think it holds up with Zillow. I know their software is great for their agents on the backend, but not into it as a consumer. Overall I like it as a long-term play.

586,,2021-05-25 02:00:02,t3_nkedem,,wallstreetbets,"I want to preface this by saying that I‚Äôm primarily a value investor (although many of my clients do own growth stocks) so my area of expertise isn‚Äôt necessarily on growth stocks like PENN. With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can‚Äôt necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what‚Äôs to come. So, let‚Äôs take a look at PENN‚Äôs growth. 

In 2015 Penn‚Äôs revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN‚Äôs revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN‚Äôs debt to asset ratio of 80% isn‚Äôt terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN‚Äôs partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

Thanks for reading this. If you liked my analysis and are curious about a company‚Äôs value, feel free to let me know.",nkedem,Should you bet on PENN?

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC‚Äôs Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,The PLUG Restatement: A Great Chance to Get Out

Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.¬† There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".¬† The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.¬† Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.¬† In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.¬† In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.¬†   


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.¬† While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?¬† Good question.¬† I don't know yet.¬† Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.¬† Another good question.¬† I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?¬† The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.¬† They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.¬† This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.¬† *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**¬†   


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.¬† And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?¬† I don't know, but here's a scary graph.¬† So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.¬† Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.¬† Not significantly.¬† After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.¬† So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.¬† Doesn't seem like much.¬† But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.¬† I went down another rabbit hole.¬† 1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?¬† The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.¬† Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.¬† Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).¬† It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.¬† After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.¬† And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.¬† When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?¬† A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.¬† But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.¬† 

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.¬† Short the S&P there.  


Or you could just go to the source, nevermind, retail traders can't get any accurate, up to date, actionable market data.  You can go to the fed, but it's 3 days late.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

**This week's things to watch for:**

  
Tomorrow we also get the results from the Richmond manufacturing index and Consumer confidence.¬† 

Last week, the Empire Index was up (barely) though the prices paid were higher (higher inflation).¬† The Philly index was down, and prices paid were at 40 year highs.¬† Tomorrow is Richmond.¬† Where the fuck is Richmond?  Thursday is unemployment claims, and Friday is another print of CPI.¬† But it's on a holiday weekend.¬† So responses should be muted.¬† If bad, look for a bloody Tuesday.¬† If good, fuck it, why not?

In short, no.

SelfWealth members have been allowed to buy and sell GME as  well as others like AMC, throughout the entirety of 2021. This is in  stark comparison to other platforms that entirely halted the trading of  certain stocks.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME ‚Äì  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.¬† These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",nkk4c1,where to buy GME stocks in Australia?! SelfWealth is evil and stake was dodgy!

you can legally yolo all your money into a horrible option, and you can become a homeless person or billionaire at any given time. What is the difference between these 2 groups, well to me it is structure.

&#x200B;

You may be saying, 'well I have my trading system so I am good right?', no - you are not. You are missing 50% of the equation. Hear me out:

&#x200B;

A trading STRUCTURE is what should house, or literally be the roof and foundation for your SYSTEM. Imagine a trading system being a furnace, it cannot keep you warm and safe without a roof, walls, and foundation. So, what is my structure and system; here ya go:

&#x200B;

Trading Structure (Literal Home):

**Foundation**: Risk Management - All decisions, all other elements, and all trades are GROUNDED in risk management. I get it, 'Apes Stick Together' or whatever, but I use stop losses - I enter every trade with a set loss and take profit. I do not get emotional, I have a plan, and each trade is a 3 reward to 1 risk setup at least for a small move.

**Walls**: I base my 4 balls of success on:

1. 3 Analysis: 
   1. **Fundamental Analysis** based on news, P/E Ratio, Floats, EPS, etc. 
   2. **Technical Analysis** based on charts, graphs, value. If you are one of those 'AsTrOlOgY fOr IdIoTs' people, fine but understand you are handicapping yourself due to your own ego.
   3. **Mental Analysis** based on confidence, execution, and planning.
2. **Macro Economic** moves like inflation rates, money supply, consumer confidence; and Indexes like S&P, Nasdaq, DOW30, Russell2000, etc. I also study the 11 sectors intently too.
3. **Trading Plan** that includes a stop loss, a loading or buying zone, a price target, and an exit strategy and entry strategy already planned.
4. **Goal Setting** for my 1 month, 6 month, 1 year, 5 year, etc.... and what each trade does to help these goals.

From there my '**ROOF**' or my added protection is consistency. I stick to these rules. Before every trade, I double check with my 'roof' that I am being consistent. When I am in a trade, I check to make sure I am being consistent. When I exit - guess what, I check I am being consistent.

There will be some nights we would all enjoy and actually benefit from not having a roof. Those 73 degree, sunny days come - and we may enjoy sleeping in a tent or even sleeping with the sound of toad ribbits and cricket songs, and we give that up. We do because there are also hurricane level monsoons and without a roof, your whole room will be ruined (blowing up your account).

&#x200B;

From there, you place your SYSTEM in this STRUCTURE. Scalping, great. Day trader, beautiful. Swing, long term, only ETF, dividends!? That is fine. Anytime frame, any short term goal, and account size; all of the things that make your TRADING EDGE or SYSTEM goes into the STRUCUTRE.

&#x200B;

Please have both. Please have rules. Please understand you are in a chaotic neutral system, with 0 rules, 0 guidance, 0 anything. You either create your own structure, or have none. You fail to plan, than you're planning to fail. Good luck.",nkq9et,The Difference Between A Trading Structure And A Trading System

I want to call attention to the fact that GME has been consolidating for 2 months and looks just about ready to launch. Check the chart below courtesy of traderstewie. For months GME has been tightening and building higher lows on the daily and weekly. The key level to break out of the wedge is \~190 which we're pretty much exactly at now. Above $190 the path looks open to $300+.

**What I'm saying my friends is that GME is starting to look like a rocket launch site.**

The only thing missing is VOLUME. SPCE & TSLA look interesting but what we're seeing in GME is 5-star. Think maybe it's time we get the band back together.

Not advice, I just like the stock. Do you?

*As always, do your own due diligence. Knowing how to read charts can make you slightly more likely to catch break outs and mitigate losses but there is always uncertainty. Don't speculate with $ you can't afford to lose.*

Thus, the banks would no longer operate illegal and unlawful financing should they offer loans and other services to the companies. That would be a huge step in removing what analysts are calling an obstacle to the development of a national cannabis industry.

Legislators voted for the bill with 321-101 votes and sent it to the Senate.

https://preview.redd.it/5mpqdo4tja171.jpg?width=660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1255ec4f5a2471772ca27ad86ea25c16167d241b

The bill clarifies that proceeds from legal cannabis deals are not considered illegal and instructs federal regulators to create rules on how they would oversee such banking activities. Banks have so far been unwilling to do business with companies that sell marijuana or related products, fearing they could run into conflict with US federal law. This has left marijuana companies with few options to rely on a handful of small financial institutions or do cash deals. The American Bankers Association has aggressively lobbied for the SAFE Banking Act bill.

The banks have been in a difficult position due to the conflict between state and federal law, so it makes sense that Congress must act now to resolve this conflict. Thirty-six US states have now legalized medical cannabis, while 17 states already allow recreational use of cannabis by adults.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would try to push legislation. The positive reaction of the stock prices of Tilray, Sundial Growers, Aphria or Aurora Cannabis shows the great relief of investors. Investors hope that this could have kicked off further progressive reforms in the cannabis sector. This move took the potential of a game-changing marijuana law an important step forward.

If Congress passes the SAFE Banking Act and President Joe Biden signs it, it would likely become much easier and cheaper for marijuana companies to raise the capital they need to fund their growth initiatives. The law should also make cannabis companies safer and more efficient, as credit services would reduce the need for cash in day-to-day operations.

Currently the stock is down 15-20% from the opening bell. Who cares? Nobody is fever-buying IPOs like they were late last year or early this year. But this is actually the perfect time to buy in. Why? Well this IPO is actually occurring exactly when YouTube is just about to fuck over all of the business YouTube accounts in the USA.

What is YouTube doing to fuck over businesses? Well they are starting to run ads on non-partnered content. See source here, from the November terms of use update: [https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719)

If you don't want to read this, basically it says that channels that aren't partners are now going to get ads on their videos and YouTube is keeping ALL of the revenue (fuck you, right?). I've personally already witnessed this because I manage YT channels for several businesses and I've already gotten ads. And guess who gets a call every time their client sees an ad on their videos? Me, I get the call. 

&#x200B;

**When does this happen?**

It's already started. I've started seeing ads on corporate non-monetized and uncopyrighted videos within the last couple weeks, but the change is supposed to be implemented across the country in June. I've already been getting calls from my boss and from clients. We are already moving a lot of content to Vimeo.

&#x200B;

**Why does this matter?** 

Businesses are not going to be happy if their competitors are running ads on their videos. Especially if that ad occurs when the video is embedded on their own website. I know for a fact that ads are showing in YouTube but there has been no distinction that I'm aware of that would prohibit them from running ads in embedded videos on a website or blog. 

&#x200B;

**What is going to happen?**

If businesses start seeing competitor ads on their videos, they will do everything they can to stop it. They can either join the YPP and disable ads or they can leave the platform. However, there are requirements to the YPP:

1. They must have 1,000 subscribers
2. They must have 4,000 watch hours in the last 12 months

I can promise you that most businesses do not even come close to meeting these requirements. They can try to purchase subscribers or views but YouTube is good at identifying this. Trust me, I've gone down that road and have seen channels get taken down because of it.

&#x200B;

**Why is VMEO the best play here?**

The main reason is because businesses will leave YouTube.

Vimeo is hand-down my favorite video hosting service for a few reasons:

* The video encode quality is visibly better
* The embedded player is 100% customizable
* It's easier to pick thumbnails
* It has a built-in review system for businesses
* And the best feature, you can update videos without changing the URL (very helpful for embedding)

What's the drawback? It costs $7/month for most of these features. But businesses will gladly pay that to not have their competitors on their website/videos.

It might fight $90 for 1 or 2 days, and then retrace to 21 ema (must be close to the ascending support line around $72) Wise decision would be to close a position now and re-enter at a lower price.  
Another data point to be cautions, analysts 12 month high price target - $90.

Trade cautiously, do your own DD.

629,,2021-05-25 19:36:59,t3_nky421,,wallstreetbets,"So a week ago I bought 4K in options for ARKX and UFO.  It started when I had the prophetic revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector. And because increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I stopped smoking weed.  My first thought was that if the government doesn‚Äôt release the report then I‚Äôm fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report sometime in June. However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it‚Äôs another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  After every national emergency, such as saying this is foreign tech would be, it has caused defense contract stocks to go up 5-10%. Also many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.  Finally I looked up ufo on google trends today and it is up 3x its 12 month average.  Google trends have been shown to foresee increase in prices.

GME has been consolidating between the bag holders of the first and second peaks. As you can see, on average, nobody is bag holding now. This is good sign for bulls. I would expect a retest of the 195/200 range. If that holds, it's game on.

Mods, this is a technical analysis post...not a freaking literary dissertation. Having a length requirement on a post that is obviously going to mostly consist of a picture is ridiculous. Bad Bot. 

&#x200B;

If we really need to get this longer then why don't I explain the significance of VWAP. It stands for volume weighted average price. It basically shows the price normalized by the volumes of buyers and sellers that have bought/sold in the past. Why is this important? It's important because it more accurately indicates where there are zones of overhead supply (bag holders waiting to sell once they break even) or pent up demand (most holders are feeling good and waiting to buy dips). In this case, price has been stuck between the psychology of two market participants; the bag holders and the (not?) bag holders. Now that price is above both VWAP levels, more market participants are ITM than not ITM. This means less selling pressure. This means moon.",nkz1y6,GME Anchored VWAP

Hello Hivemind,

From a fundamentalist and technical analysis perspective, I predict with a high degree of certainty that there will be strong price action coming within the next month, and I believe it'll be upward momentum. Here's why:

Fundamentally.  
\-Earnings are in a month. Here we may have another chance at the possibility of seeing the FB settlement or selling of Huwaei patents  
\-Earnings should beat last quarter. I promise you this hack on Colonial pipeline puckered a lot of businesses anuses and companies must all be looking at the best possible ways to increase their end-to-end security, also the shoutout from the hacker Darkside recommending Cyclance (IF the texts were real) is bigger than you think. Also, those of you who are invested and or bag holding should have also subscribed to Cyclance for $29, every one of those subscriptions helps their bottom line.  
\-Increase in advertisements. A lot more sponsored ads coming up on Reddit, Twitter, and also in other forms from Blackberry.  
\-No publicity is bad publicity. We still get connected with Jim Cramer's ""Reddit Stocks"" list on TV, but our price action never moves that drastically in comparison to the S&P 500. I have no doubt in my mind those who actually do their research, follow the price action, and the news from this company they'll see what treasure lies in store, but they could be looking for a better entry price. Currently, the average price target from CNN is $8.76 and $BB is very close as of writing at $8.60. Analyst projections going from $4.60 to $20. Following analyst's opinions are not always a great indicator, but this helps my prediction that there will be some turbulence will be coming soon, up or down.  
\-Massive institutional investment. I cannot stress this enough. Go on Fintel.io and you'll see recent additions to their portfolios from names like:  
\-Citadel. Bought 1,400,000 shares this quarter. Net Long on calls and puts  
\-Great West Life Assurance - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of New York - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of Montreal - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Many others, such as PrimeCap, Fidelity, and Vanguard  
Institutions are getting in, and heavily. there is a possibility that the price was beaten or manipulated down so institutions may enter at a cheap price but that's a different conversation, this is a conversation about $BB and the large chance of a movement, not manipulation.

Technical analysis.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4di35esjtb171.png?width=2177&format=png&auto=webp&s=822146cd7f5af19db4410aeae6646557bd864cd9

From this picture, we can see how the Bollinger bands are tightening up immensely, and we are about to see a triple cross of the 20/50/200 DMA. Both of these are signals of a large movement in price and if institutions are getting in so recently I couldn't imagine it's going to tank much further.  
An interesting note to make is how nicely the candles follow the Bollinger bands up and down, as well as when they touch the 50/200 DMA. Once the two cross that'll be either our death or golden cross. Hard to say which way, but I'd suggest it's up with all these companies are increasing their portfolio of $BB by 30%+.

This is the reason why I believe this is the signal. Call it apophenia if you aren't into TA but it can be an incredible tool for establishing share price.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9avjw90ltb171.png?width=2181&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f8c005da597398a5c107c70ab62c72b61d6e467

This chart shows the significance of \~$8.60 from history going back to April 2017 on the farthest left. The green dotted line shows how many times it acted as support but as well as resistance.  
This makes our current price range very strong because of how many times BB has touched \~$8.60. There have been times where it has tested below but eventually it has propped itself back up so far every time. It acted as resistance during the first stage of the WSB rally in January, came back down, and that was the signal to the upside.  
The next signal to the upside is \~$14.51 because of the yellow line. That was resistance during the WSB rally in which the daily candle spiked up and as well as acted at resistance on Jan 18 and as well after the crash.  
If $BB breaks \~$14.51 and secures it, $BB may go parabolic again.

But what if it goes down?  
The next support line below \~$8.60 is \~$6.50. But that probably won't happen because of $BB's Enterprise value. As of writing based the enterprise value is $4.98B and in comparison, our market cap is $4.81B, which puts BB's enterprise value and market cap very close in line with each other.

Final notes:  
I believe with a very high degree of confidence that $BB is going to move up now and we've reached very close to the bottom. I understand that it is impossible to predict the market but with these tools, research, my personal understanding of the market and its psychology involved, I think that $BB is primed and the uptrend may begin.

I am not your financial advisor. I am not a professional. I am only a mere student of the game which is life and the market.

I hold 2000 shares of BB and will be adding upon confirmation of the upside.

Please comment below on anything else you believe should be added to this if you have any additional insight to bring forward and I'll certainly edit it in.",nkza6a,$BB - Expect Large Movements WithIn 1 Month.

Ford‚Äôs plan to invest in EVs and self-driving cars rose to $29 billion, including $22 billion for EVs through 2025. 

Ford and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL are entering a six-year deal that will make the tech giant responsible for much of Ford‚Äôs growing in-vehicle connectivity. This partnership is designed to streamline Ford‚Äôs operations and accelerate an ongoing $11 billion restructuring plan. 

General Motors:

General Motors announced that it plans to invest $27 billion in EV and autonomous vehicles through 2025. The company also mentioned that it plans to release 30 EV models globally by 2025.

The company has partnered with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT in leading a $2 billion investment round in self-driving car startup Cruise LLC.

Difference:
Ford is going with Google and General Motors is going with Microsoft. 

Google has 14 Automotive startup investments and Acquisitions.

Microsoft only has investments in 4 automotive startups.

This will help Ford and General Motors in the following areas:

- Autonomous driving technology.
- Connected car tech & fleet management.
- Electric vehicle technology.
- Automotive retail.
- Mobility-as-a-service & shared mobility.

Who wins?
In this situation Ford has the better outlook, Google with 14 different Automotive startups to do its project development for Ford, also Google has access to Android and will give Ford the ability to integrate mobile connectivity to their cars.

I consider GME GANG like a coalition of angry üêù's ready to attack the üêª's trying to take our üçØ. 

Think of it like the French. They love to eat croissants, play soccer and shit... but if the government were to raise the age of social security or some shit? The entire population riots and brings out the fucking guillotine's to remind the leaders as to what happened to King Louie all those years ago. That's what we need to do here especially in America. Let this be their fucking reminder

We are so blinded as a society here in üá∫üá∏ with so many fucking distractions on a daily basis. Sports, news, new cell phone and console releases, propaganda, etc. All these distractions are creating us to be too individualistic and less collectivist. This is all to make the masses think that it's every man for himself (or herself) and keep us all enslaved in this selfish form of üìÉ ‚úã thinking.

Both companies are massively overvalued at the current price and a pull back will happen, just how much volatility there will be before then is impossible to predict. I know this is a gambling sub, but I'll only gamble in the stock market in a position where I feel I'm most likely to win, otherwise I'd do it on sports that is a bit more entertaining than watching a line go up or down.

2) holders are obnoxious and do not understand that when you say something bad about a company, it doesn't mean you want to short it. Holders are mega defensive on everything and think there's an active campaign to suppress their stocks when they're by far the most mentioned on this sub. 

3) holders of these companies complain that the sub has gone to shit, and yet are still happy to spam their ticker here for no reason, while also claiming to be long term shareholders. If you're in it for the long run, why the fuck do you care what anyone here thinks? What do you have to gain from posting here? If this sub is ""compromised"", why the fuck do I still see your idiotic comment?

4) massive entitlement, thinking that they made this sub great as subscriber count has grown 100x over the last couple years, when in fact their addition has completely deteriorated the quality of the discussions on this sub. But mods can't ban these discussions as it's a slippery slope to over moderation.

It wasn't obvious. It has been ""about to pump"" for months. I imagine you would've gone all in in options and up until last week basically anything you purchased likely would've expired worthless if you're speaking to buying OTM calls.

> I‚Äôd never get fucked ever and I‚Äôd be the one fucking.

One big win won't insulate you from getting fucked again. That's the mentality of a person who invites others to fuck them.

> I wish I had it all in GME, would‚Äôve came out the smartest investor of 2021

GME was a bad trade until it wasn't, like anything else. Even DFV couldn't have predicted this-- he bought a stock that was undervalued and near it's all time low, basically finding a stock that only had the potential to go up. The ensuing theatrics with GME were just happenstance, luck. Plenty of boomers have plenty of shares in GME for decades. 

> I have 0 positions in the memes. And I kept doubting them and now I‚Äôm getting fucked left and right.

You're not getting fucked. No one is fucking you. You're just not buying into memes. That's it. If you want to risk it, do it. If you can't stomach the returns while also being unable to stomach the FOMO, then you're in the wrong fuckin place.

There are some issues with the commodities prices rising here and there. But the world kind of accepted the money printing. IMO we're looking at good years coming up. The next crisis won't be caused by the financial system or too high valuations but by global warming. That's the only possible external shock that could culminate in an unforseen event. My guess is we have around 10-15 good years ahead then it all depends on what the weather does. Each crisis is unique, and calling another dot-com crash is plain dumb at this point.

With A flash of light and several yelps the bears dispersed and ran off into the woods. 

SPY opened her eyes and tried to focus them in the light to see her hero. JPOW takes his hand and gently brushes the market‚Äôs hair out of her eyes. She blushes. 

‚ÄúThank you for saving me from that terrible position. If he drilled another 7% I would never have been the same.‚Äù

\- 1929 debt run rampant, similar to 2007.

\- 1987 junk bonds fell through after a merger failed as they were the mechanism for funding the UAL merger.

\- 2000 was because there were companies overvalued with no prospects of actually ever operating - think obscure crypto currency.

\- 2007 was because debt wasn't serviceable.

Commonality - debt wasn't serviceable. People seem to assume there's no fix for that, but that's exactly what inflation exists for. Inflation exists to debase the currency to increase debt serviceability. That's exactly what the fed did when they started buying buying out junk bonds at the start of the pandemic. Thats exactly what boosted the market out of the 1929 & 2007 slumps, and it just happened again.

Pinned down by the alpha, he was ready to thrust into her as the group sneered and laughed. The alpha bear saw an entry point and began to drill his member into SPY. She closed her eyes and clenched her jaw hoping someone, anyone would help her find an exit strategy. Just as soon as the alpha entered his position he was met with resistance. With A flash of light and several yelps the bears dispersed and ran off into the woods. 

SPY opened her eyes and tried to focus them in the light to see her hero. JPOW takes his hand and gently brushes the market‚Äôs hair out of her eyes. She blushes. 

‚ÄúThank you for saving me from that terrible position. If he drilled another 7% I would never have been the same.‚Äù

JPOW looks deep into SPYs eyes. The energy around him shifts from a calming familiar friend to that of a sinister deviant.

 *6. Nobody needs gamestop to buy games online, you can buy them at amazon?!*

Tell that the Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen who sold pet products online. In direct competition with Amazon. And made billions of dollars doing it............ Oh wait, isn't he becoming GameStop's board chairman this June? Isn't Ryan Cohen leading a new committee in charge of a company-wide transformation? Hasn't Ryan Cohen also hired multiple Amazon and Chewy executives in leadership positions to transform Gamestop?

All this GME price action over the last year has just been on the ***announcement***  that Ryan Cohen is involved. Imagine when they actually start making changes to pivot this juggernaut to dominate online gaming retail. Who's gonna be their competition? aMaZoN? Cause Amazon is world famous for its gaming retail and niche gaming products?? üòÇ

Pinned down by the alpha, he was ready to thrust into her as the group sneered and laughed. The alpha bear saw an entry point and began to drill his member into SPY. She closed her eyes and clenched her jaw hoping someone, anyone would help her find an exit strategy. Just as soon as the alpha entered his position he was met with resistance. With A flash of light and several yelps the bears dispersed and ran off into the woods. 

SPY opened her eyes and tried to focus them in the light to see her hero. JPOW takes his hand and gently brushes the market‚Äôs hair out of her eyes. She blushes. 

‚ÄúThank you for saving me from that terrible position. If he drilled another 7% I would never have been the same.‚Äù

JPOW looks deep into SPYs eyes. The energy around him shifts from a calming familiar friend to that of a sinister deviant.

A decreasing world population with increased purchasing power doesn‚Äôt change market saturation conditions. If there are less people, they will buy less of certain things. You CAN have too much stuff and while planned obsolescence has delayed some of that, push it too far and you forever lose a customer in the absence of monopolies.

The ONLY real solution would be to cut production and limit the product on the market. The side effect of doing that is you fire people. This leads to a deflationary spiral because if more people lose purchasing power, there‚Äôs even less money chasing product which deflates even more.

So simply put, I don‚Äôt think your thesis will hold up to depopulation. And modernization has actually led to less being needed anyways, with tech adding utility and making clutter more unnecessary.

Deflation is coming.",,

Due to improvements in refrigeration needs more countries expected in coming months

Revenue for the quarter came in at **$747.27 million versus** the **consensus estimate of $620.18** million which is **200% revenue growth from Q4 2020**

Q1 EPS of ($0.48), in-line with the analyst estimate of ($0.48

By end of the year, # of markets will be doubled from last year

For the second quarter of 2021, revenue is expected to be between **$1.025 billion and $1.075 billion,** which represents **41% sequential growth over 1Q21** at the midpoint of the expected range. Adjusted EBITDA1  is expected to be between ($5) million and $5 million, which represents breakeven margin at the midpoint of the expected range

AND, Opendoor has about $**2 billion in cash.** If you follow the industry, you know that M&A is a real winner which will give them to expand even faster to additional markets.

I can't really think of many stocks that are better than Opendoor. Lots of potential here and it's at the price it jumped to on DA. It is more than 50%+ off of its highs and I think it represents a great buying opportunity as of right now.

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 6 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is just about over, so there is a good chance that this is going to be the final spreadsheet until Q2 rolls around. Thank you all for joining me for the ride!

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season!

4356,,2021-05-24 19:42:47,t3_nk6fnw,,wallstreetbets,"Well, the commodity market has been on fire. The question is... is that gonna continue? 
While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and copper for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc) 
I am long on TRQ .",nk6fnw,$TRQ and the Copper/Gold play

It seems to me that this is an important market indicator - if the CEO of a large company sells most of his stock or buys more, this indirectly determines the company's performance and the mood of employees. Of course, insider trading based on non-public information is illegal. However, when the company's employees buy or sell its shares in large quantities, it is completely legal and an important indicator of its affairs.

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Their next earnings are slated for 6/10/21 after market close.

The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don‚Äôt think it holds up with Zillow.

With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can‚Äôt necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what‚Äôs to come. So, let‚Äôs take a look at PENN‚Äôs growth. 

In 2015 Penn‚Äôs revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN‚Äôs revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN‚Äôs debt to asset ratio of 80% isn‚Äôt terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN‚Äôs partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

Thanks for reading this. If you liked my analysis and are curious about a company‚Äôs value, feel free to let me know.",nkedem,Should you bet on PENN?

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC‚Äôs Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,The PLUG Restatement: A Great Chance to Get Out

Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.¬† There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".¬† The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.¬† Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.¬† In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.¬† In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.¬†   


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.¬† While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?¬† Good question.¬† I don't know yet.¬† Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.¬† Another good question.¬† I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?¬† The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.¬† They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.¬† This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.¬† *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**¬†   


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.¬† And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?¬† I don't know, but here's a scary graph.¬† So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.¬† Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.¬† Not significantly.¬† After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.¬† So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.¬† Doesn't seem like much.¬† But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.¬† I went down another rabbit hole.¬† 1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?¬† The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.¬† Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.¬† Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).¬† It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.¬† After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.¬† And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.¬† When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?¬† A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.¬† But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.¬† 

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.¬† Short the S&P there.  


Or you could just go to the source, nevermind, retail traders can't get any accurate, up to date, actionable market data.  You can go to the fed, but it's 3 days late.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

**This week's things to watch for:**

  
Tomorrow we also get the results from the Richmond manufacturing index and Consumer confidence.¬† 

Last week, the Empire Index was up (barely) though the prices paid were higher (higher inflation).¬† The Philly index was down, and prices paid were at 40 year highs.¬† Tomorrow is Richmond.¬† Where the fuck is Richmond?  Thursday is unemployment claims, and Friday is another print of CPI.¬† But it's on a holiday weekend.¬† So responses should be muted.¬† If bad, look for a bloody Tuesday.¬† If good, fuck it, why not?  All time highs again.

# Does SelfWealth impose any restrictions on stocks such as GameStop (GME)?

* 25 days ago
* Updated

&#x200B;

In short, no.

SelfWealth members have been allowed to buy and sell GME as  well as others like AMC, throughout the entirety of 2021. This is in  stark comparison to other platforms that entirely halted the trading of  certain stocks.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

my god..

and also they retain the voting rights?! i want out but i dont know who else allows buying of gme and amc... i had a stake account but they stopped letting people buy shares back in January and that's when i got into selfwealth and have been ever since but finding this out today is quiet frightening..

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME ‚Äì  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.¬† These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",nkk4c1,where to buy GME stocks in Australia?! SelfWealth is evil and stake was dodgy!

you can legally yolo all your money into a horrible option, and you can become a homeless person or billionaire at any given time. What is the difference between these 2 groups, well to me it is structure.

&#x200B;

You may be saying, 'well I have my trading system so I am good right?', no - you are not. You are missing 50% of the equation. Hear me out:

&#x200B;

A trading STRUCTURE is what should house, or literally be the roof and foundation for your SYSTEM. Imagine a trading system being a furnace, it cannot keep you warm and safe without a roof, walls, and foundation. So, what is my structure and system; here ya go:

&#x200B;

Trading Structure (Literal Home):

**Foundation**: Risk Management - All decisions, all other elements, and all trades are GROUNDED in risk management. I get it, 'Apes Stick Together' or whatever, but I use stop losses - I enter every trade with a set loss and take profit. I do not get emotional, I have a plan, and each trade is a 3 reward to 1 risk setup at least for a small move.

**Walls**: I base my 4 balls of success on:

1. 3 Analysis: 
   1. **Fundamental Analysis** based on news, P/E Ratio, Floats, EPS, etc. 
   2. **Technical Analysis** based on charts, graphs, value. If you are one of those 'AsTrOlOgY fOr IdIoTs' people, fine but understand you are handicapping yourself due to your own ego.
   3. **Mental Analysis** based on confidence, execution, and planning.
2. **Macro Economic** moves like inflation rates, money supply, consumer confidence; and Indexes like S&P, Nasdaq, DOW30, Russell2000, etc. I also study the 11 sectors intently too.
3. **Trading Plan** that includes a stop loss, a loading or buying zone, a price target, and an exit strategy and entry strategy already planned.
4. **Goal Setting** for my 1 month, 6 month, 1 year, 5 year, etc.... and what each trade does to help these goals.

From there my '**ROOF**' or my added protection is consistency. I stick to these rules. Before every trade, I double check with my 'roof' that I am being consistent. When I am in a trade, I check to make sure I am being consistent. When I exit - guess what, I check I am being consistent.

There will be some nights we would all enjoy and actually benefit from not having a roof. Those 73 degree, sunny days come - and we may enjoy sleeping in a tent or even sleeping with the sound of toad ribbits and cricket songs, and we give that up. We do because there are also hurricane level monsoons and without a roof, your whole room will be ruined (blowing up your account).

&#x200B;

From there, you place your SYSTEM in this STRUCTURE. Scalping, great. Day trader, beautiful. Swing, long term, only ETF, dividends!? That is fine. Anytime frame, any short term goal, and account size; all of the things that make your TRADING EDGE or SYSTEM goes into the STRUCUTRE.

&#x200B;

Please have both. Please have rules. Please understand you are in a chaotic neutral system, with 0 rules, 0 guidance, 0 anything. You either create your own structure, or have none. You fail to plan, than you're planning to fail. Good luck.",nkq9et,The Difference Between A Trading Structure And A Trading System

I want to call attention to the fact that GME has been consolidating for 2 months and looks just about ready to launch. Check the chart below courtesy of traderstewie. For months GME has been tightening and building higher lows on the daily and weekly. The key level to break out of the wedge is \~190 which we're pretty much exactly at now. Above $190 the path looks open to $300+.

**What I'm saying my friends is that GME is starting to look like a rocket launch site.**

The only thing missing is VOLUME. SPCE & TSLA look interesting but what we're seeing in GME is 5-star. Think maybe it's time we get the band back together.

Not advice, I just like the stock. Do you?

*As always, do your own due diligence. Knowing how to read charts can make you slightly more likely to catch break outs and mitigate losses but there is always uncertainty. Don't speculate with $ you can't afford to lose.*

While EXPI is doing 14.6 times the amount of selling that Zillow is it has a market cap that is 6.75 times less than Zillow. That means the EXPI could easily move up 6 times what it is trading at now.

28x6=$168 per share.

EXPI also just increased their share buyback program from 75m to 475m. Which means they could buy a ton of stock and are probably going to announce a share buyback. Sending the already 54% insider owned stock absolutely skyrocketing due to them not selling the stock and supply running short.

They also are expanding into other countries right now and are on pace to be the largest worldwide real estate company.

Thus, the banks would no longer operate illegal and unlawful financing should they offer loans and other services to the companies. That would be a huge step in removing what analysts are calling an obstacle to the development of a national cannabis industry.

Legislators voted for the bill with 321-101 votes and sent it to the Senate.

https://preview.redd.it/5mpqdo4tja171.jpg?width=660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1255ec4f5a2471772ca27ad86ea25c16167d241b

The bill clarifies that proceeds from legal cannabis deals are not considered illegal and instructs federal regulators to create rules on how they would oversee such banking activities. Banks have so far been unwilling to do business with companies that sell marijuana or related products, fearing they could run into conflict with US federal law. This has left marijuana companies with few options to rely on a handful of small financial institutions or do cash deals. The American Bankers Association has aggressively lobbied for the SAFE Banking Act bill.

The banks have been in a difficult position due to the conflict between state and federal law, so it makes sense that Congress must act now to resolve this conflict. Thirty-six US states have now legalized medical cannabis, while 17 states already allow recreational use of cannabis by adults.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would try to push legislation. The positive reaction of the stock prices of Tilray, Sundial Growers, Aphria or Aurora Cannabis shows the great relief of investors. Investors hope that this could have kicked off further progressive reforms in the cannabis sector. This move took the potential of a game-changing marijuana law an important step forward.

If Congress passes the SAFE Banking Act and President Joe Biden signs it, it would likely become much easier and cheaper for marijuana companies to raise the capital they need to fund their growth initiatives. The law should also make cannabis companies safer and more efficient, as credit services would reduce the need for cash in day-to-day operations.

Currently the stock is down 15-20% from the opening bell. Who cares? Nobody is fever-buying IPOs like they were late last year or early this year. But this is actually the perfect time to buy in. Why? Well this IPO is actually occurring exactly when YouTube is just about to fuck over all of the business YouTube accounts in the USA.

What is YouTube doing to fuck over businesses? Well they are starting to run ads on non-partnered content. See source here, from the November terms of use update: [https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719)

If you don't want to read this, basically it says that channels that aren't partners are now going to get ads on their videos and YouTube is keeping ALL of the revenue (fuck you, right?). I've personally already witnessed this because I manage YT channels for several businesses and I've already gotten ads. And guess who gets a call every time their client sees an ad on their videos? Me, I get the call. 

&#x200B;

**When does this happen?**

It's already started. I've started seeing ads on corporate non-monetized and uncopyrighted videos within the last couple weeks, but the change is supposed to be implemented across the country in June. I've already been getting calls from my boss and from clients. We are already moving a lot of content to Vimeo.

&#x200B;

**Why does this matter?** 

Businesses are not going to be happy if their competitors are running ads on their videos. Especially if that ad occurs when the video is embedded on their own website. I know for a fact that ads are showing in YouTube but there has been no distinction that I'm aware of that would prohibit them from running ads in embedded videos on a website or blog. 

&#x200B;

**What is going to happen?**

If businesses start seeing competitor ads on their videos, they will do everything they can to stop it. They can either join the YPP and disable ads or they can leave the platform. However, there are requirements to the YPP:

1. They must have 1,000 subscribers
2. They must have 4,000 watch hours in the last 12 months

I can promise you that most businesses do not even come close to meeting these requirements. They can try to purchase subscribers or views but YouTube is good at identifying this. Trust me, I've gone down that road and have seen channels get taken down because of it.

&#x200B;

**Why is VMEO the best play here?**

The main reason is because businesses will leave YouTube.

Vimeo is hand-down my favorite video hosting service for a few reasons:

* The video encode quality is visibly better
* The embedded player is 100% customizable
* It's easier to pick thumbnails
* It has a built-in review system for businesses
* And the best feature, you can update videos without changing the URL (very helpful for embedding)

What's the drawback? It costs $7/month for most of these features. But businesses will gladly pay that to not have their competitors on their website/videos.

Positions: Shares 11 VMEO @ $43.25. I'll be loading up more soon.",nkv7q2,VMEO's IPO had perfect timing (and not by accident)

This is not a financial Advise,

RBLX has been on a bull run for past week and more. I wanted to to highlight few critical points here.

RBLX is approaching its resistance, Bearish in short term.  
It might fight $90 for 1 or 2 days, and then retrace to 21 ema (must be close to the ascending support line around $72) Wise decision would be to close a position now and re-enter at a lower price.  
Another data point to be cautions, analysts 12 month high price target - $90.

It started when I had the prophetic revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector. And because increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I stopped smoking weed.  My first thought was that if the government doesn‚Äôt release the report then I‚Äôm fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report sometime in June. However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it‚Äôs another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  After every national emergency, such as saying this is foreign tech would be, it has caused defense contract stocks to go up 5-10%. Also many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.  Finally I looked up ufo on google trends today and it is up 3x its 12 month average.  Google trends have been shown to foresee increase in prices.

If we really need to get this longer then why don't I explain the significance of VWAP. It stands for volume weighted average price. It basically shows the price normalized by the volumes of buyers and sellers that have bought/sold in the past. Why is this important? It's important because it more accurately indicates where there are zones of overhead supply (bag holders waiting to sell once they break even) or pent up demand (most holders are feeling good and waiting to buy dips). In this case, price has been stuck between the psychology of two market participants; the bag holders and the (not?) bag holders. Now that price is above both VWAP levels, more market participants are ITM than not ITM. This means less selling pressure. This means moon.",nkz1y6,GME Anchored VWAP

Hello Hivemind,

From a fundamentalist and technical analysis perspective, I predict with a high degree of certainty that there will be strong price action coming within the next month, and I believe it'll be upward momentum. Here's why:

Fundamentally.  
\-Earnings are in a month. Here we may have another chance at the possibility of seeing the FB settlement or selling of Huwaei patents  
\-Earnings should beat last quarter. I promise you this hack on Colonial pipeline puckered a lot of businesses anuses and companies must all be looking at the best possible ways to increase their end-to-end security, also the shoutout from the hacker Darkside recommending Cyclance (IF the texts were real) is bigger than you think. Also, those of you who are invested and or bag holding should have also subscribed to Cyclance for $29, every one of those subscriptions helps their bottom line.  
\-Increase in advertisements. A lot more sponsored ads coming up on Reddit, Twitter, and also in other forms from Blackberry.  
\-No publicity is bad publicity. We still get connected with Jim Cramer's ""Reddit Stocks"" list on TV, but our price action never moves that drastically in comparison to the S&P 500. I have no doubt in my mind those who actually do their research, follow the price action, and the news from this company they'll see what treasure lies in store, but they could be looking for a better entry price. Currently, the average price target from CNN is $8.76 and $BB is very close as of writing at $8.60. Analyst projections going from $4.60 to $20. Following analyst's opinions are not always a great indicator, but this helps my prediction that there will be some turbulence will be coming soon, up or down.  
\-Massive institutional investment. I cannot stress this enough. Go on Fintel.io and you'll see recent additions to their portfolios from names like:  
\-Citadel. Bought 1,400,000 shares this quarter. Net Long on calls and puts  
\-Great West Life Assurance - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of New York - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of Montreal - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Many others, such as PrimeCap, Fidelity, and Vanguard  
Institutions are getting in, and heavily. there is a possibility that the price was beaten or manipulated down so institutions may enter at a cheap price but that's a different conversation, this is a conversation about $BB and the large chance of a movement, not manipulation.

Technical analysis.

From this picture, we can see how the Bollinger bands are tightening up immensely, and we are about to see a triple cross of the 20/50/200 DMA. Both of these are signals of a large movement in price and if institutions are getting in so recently I couldn't imagine it's going to tank much further.  
An interesting note to make is how nicely the candles follow the Bollinger bands up and down, as well as when they touch the 50/200 DMA. Once the two cross that'll be either our death or golden cross. Hard to say which way, but I'd suggest it's up with all these companies are increasing their portfolio of $BB by 30%+.

This is the reason why I believe this is the signal. Call it apophenia if you aren't into TA but it can be an incredible tool for establishing share price.

&#x200B;

This chart shows the significance of \~$8.60 from history going back to April 2017 on the farthest left. The green dotted line shows how many times it acted as support but as well as resistance.  
This makes our current price range very strong because of how many times BB has touched \~$8.60. There have been times where it has tested below but eventually it has propped itself back up so far every time. It acted as resistance during the first stage of the WSB rally in January, came back down, and that was the signal to the upside.  
The next signal to the upside is \~$14.51 because of the yellow line. That was resistance during the WSB rally in which the daily candle spiked up and as well as acted at resistance on Jan 18 and as well after the crash.  
If $BB breaks \~$14.51 and secures it, $BB may go parabolic again.

But what if it goes down?  
The next support line below \~$8.60 is \~$6.50. But that probably won't happen because of $BB's Enterprise value. As of writing based the enterprise value is $4.98B and in comparison, our market cap is $4.81B, which puts BB's enterprise value and market cap very close in line with each other.

Final notes:  
I believe with a very high degree of confidence that $BB is going to move up now and we've reached very close to the bottom. I understand that it is impossible to predict the market but with these tools, research, my personal understanding of the market and its psychology involved, I think that $BB is primed and the uptrend may begin.

I am not your financial advisor. I am not a professional. I am only a mere student of the game which is life and the market.

I hold 2000 shares of BB and will be adding upon confirmation of the upside.

CPI = measure of inflation

Inflation matters because if inflation numbers come out just as high as last time, it will give more credence to the people screaming runaway inflation.

Runaway inflation is really bad because it will force the federal reserve to raise rates.

When rates rise, risk assets go poof.

Stocks and coins will either finally be dead or return to the atmosphere on this day.

**Bets**

>**BEAR** You hate the government. Inflation is here to stay from reckless printing. You think CPI will come out sky high, the highest financial authority of the land will be publicly embarrassed and raise rates. Michael Burry is a revolutionary who can be Cassandra without transitioning. You are here to own the libs.

[Basic]: Long banks and industrials, sell everything else

[Risky]: $FAZ, $SQ calls

[YOLO]: June & July $300 QQQ puts

[You hate money]: 1DTE QQQ put on June 9

>**BULL** You believe in the emperor Jamie Powell and the fair lady Yellen. May CPI was just transitory inflation from a burst of demand. You have eyes and see that commodity futures are correcting. You are emboldened by the recovery of coins and growth stocks in the past weeks. You love buying high.

[Basic]: Buy anything but the banks and industrials.

[Risky]: $ARKK, $SQ calls

[YOLO]: June & July calls on literally any growth stock

[You hate money]: 1DTE QQQ call on June 9

If not‚Ä¶ 

On the same page in settings under the heading ‚ÄúService Request‚Äù click on ‚ÄúCreate a Request‚Äù

That‚Äôs should bring you to a search menu‚Ä¶

Type ‚ÄúW-8‚Äù and a drop down should appear with ‚ÄúW-8 Form‚Äù (chose this request if you wish to update your W8BEN for tax status on your international trading account) 

Then that should give you another drop down asking ‚ÄúWhich account account does this apply to?‚Äù  

Select the relevant a count (ensure that the account selected is your international account)

This should take you to the next step 1 of 3‚Ä¶ press continue

Then you should come to the next page which will take you to a security code request. Click get security code which will then take yoo to another page (You should receive a txt with code). Enter code

This takes you to step 2 of 3‚Ä¶. Click continue

This will take you to the next page which will state your request has been submitted and then ask you to fill out your W-8 tax form. Click complete W-8 tax form‚Ä¶

Proceed to answer all the relevant questions regarding your own specific tax information and personal info it needs and once this is complete it should be automatically sent through for approval.

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Their next earnings are slated for 6/10/21 after market close.

I don't know if this next line is necessary or not but just to be safe....I'm not a professional financial advisor and this is not investment advice.",nk79sh,$CHWY - Earnings coming up - huge upside potential

Last week I sold calls for the first time and I decided to go all in. I had about $2,780 invested in QYLD which gave me about $343 a year and $28.6 a month. I decided to retire this investment and use it to buy 500 shares of BNGO at about $5.54. I then sold 5 $6 June 18, covered calls for $245 premium which will cover my monthly hooker expense, for legal reasons that's a joke. Already I earned 70% of what QYLD would have payed me in a year.

 If my calls expire in the money then I'll make about a $300 profit for a total $545 profit in just one month. Then I'll just sell some cash covered puts then rinse and repeat. If the calls expire OTM then it's another monthly covered calls. I truly believe in BNGO which is why I have about 200 other calls on the side for the long term.

The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don‚Äôt think it holds up with Zillow. I know their software is great for their agents on the backend, but not into it as a consumer. Overall I like it as a long-term play.

5579,,2021-05-25 02:00:02,t3_nkedem,,wallstreetbets,"I want to preface this by saying that I‚Äôm primarily a value investor (although many of my clients do own growth stocks) so my area of expertise isn‚Äôt necessarily on growth stocks like PENN. With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can‚Äôt necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what‚Äôs to come. So, let‚Äôs take a look at PENN‚Äôs growth. 

In 2015 Penn‚Äôs revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN‚Äôs revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN‚Äôs debt to asset ratio of 80% isn‚Äôt terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN‚Äôs partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC‚Äôs Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,The PLUG Restatement: A Great Chance to Get Out

Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.¬† There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".¬† The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.¬† Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.¬† In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.¬† In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.¬†   


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.¬† While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?¬† Good question.¬† I don't know yet.¬† Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.¬† Another good question.¬† I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?¬† The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.¬† They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.¬† This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.¬† *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**¬†   


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.¬† And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?¬† I don't know, but here's a scary graph.¬† So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.¬† Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.¬† Not significantly.¬† After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.¬† So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.¬† Doesn't seem like much.¬† But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.¬† I went down another rabbit hole.¬† 1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?¬† The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.¬† Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.¬† Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).¬† It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.¬† After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.¬† And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.¬† When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?¬† A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.¬† But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.¬† 

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.¬† Short the S&P there.  


Or you could just go to the source, nevermind, retail traders can't get any accurate, up to date, actionable market data.  You can go to the fed, but it's 3 days late.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

**This week's things to watch for:**

  
Tomorrow we also get the results from the Richmond manufacturing index and Consumer confidence.¬† 

Last week, the Empire Index was up (barely) though the prices paid were higher (higher inflation).¬† The Philly index was down, and prices paid were at 40 year highs.¬† Tomorrow is Richmond.¬† Where the fuck is Richmond?  Thursday is unemployment claims, and Friday is another print of CPI.¬† But it's on a holiday weekend.¬† So responses should be muted.¬† If bad, look for a bloody Tuesday.¬† If good, fuck it, why not?

In short, no.

SelfWealth members have been allowed to buy and sell GME as  well as others like AMC, throughout the entirety of 2021. This is in  stark comparison to other platforms that entirely halted the trading of  certain stocks.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME ‚Äì  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.¬† These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely.

In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.

you can legally yolo all your money into a horrible option, and you can become a homeless person or billionaire at any given time. What is the difference between these 2 groups, well to me it is structure.

&#x200B;

You may be saying, 'well I have my trading system so I am good right?', no - you are not. You are missing 50% of the equation. Hear me out:

&#x200B;

A trading STRUCTURE is what should house, or literally be the roof and foundation for your SYSTEM. Imagine a trading system being a furnace, it cannot keep you warm and safe without a roof, walls, and foundation. So, what is my structure and system; here ya go:

&#x200B;

Trading Structure (Literal Home):

**Foundation**: Risk Management - All decisions, all other elements, and all trades are GROUNDED in risk management. I get it, 'Apes Stick Together' or whatever, but I use stop losses - I enter every trade with a set loss and take profit. I do not get emotional, I have a plan, and each trade is a 3 reward to 1 risk setup at least for a small move.

**Walls**: I base my 4 balls of success on:

1. 3 Analysis: 
   1. **Fundamental Analysis** based on news, P/E Ratio, Floats, EPS, etc. 
   2. **Technical Analysis** based on charts, graphs, value. If you are one of those 'AsTrOlOgY fOr IdIoTs' people, fine but understand you are handicapping yourself due to your own ego.
   3. **Mental Analysis** based on confidence, execution, and planning.
2. **Macro Economic** moves like inflation rates, money supply, consumer confidence; and Indexes like S&P, Nasdaq, DOW30, Russell2000, etc. I also study the 11 sectors intently too.
3. **Trading Plan** that includes a stop loss, a loading or buying zone, a price target, and an exit strategy and entry strategy already planned.
4. **Goal Setting** for my 1 month, 6 month, 1 year, 5 year, etc.... and what each trade does to help these goals.

From there my '**ROOF**' or my added protection is consistency. I stick to these rules. Before every trade, I double check with my 'roof' that I am being consistent. When I am in a trade, I check to make sure I am being consistent. When I exit - guess what, I check I am being consistent.

There will be some nights we would all enjoy and actually benefit from not having a roof. Those 73 degree, sunny days come - and we may enjoy sleeping in a tent or even sleeping with the sound of toad ribbits and cricket songs, and we give that up. We do because there are also hurricane level monsoons and without a roof, your whole room will be ruined (blowing up your account).

&#x200B;

From there, you place your SYSTEM in this STRUCTURE. Scalping, great. Day trader, beautiful. Swing, long term, only ETF, dividends!? That is fine. Anytime frame, any short term goal, and account size; all of the things that make your TRADING EDGE or SYSTEM goes into the STRUCUTRE.

&#x200B;

Please have both. Please have rules. Please understand you are in a chaotic neutral system, with 0 rules, 0 guidance, 0 anything. You either create your own structure, or have none. You fail to plan, than you're planning to fail. Good luck.",nkq9et,The Difference Between A Trading Structure And A Trading System

I want to call attention to the fact that GME has been consolidating for 2 months and looks just about ready to launch. Check the chart below courtesy of traderstewie. For months GME has been tightening and building higher lows on the daily and weekly. The key level to break out of the wedge is \~190 which we're pretty much exactly at now. Above $190 the path looks open to $300+.

**What I'm saying my friends is that GME is starting to look like a rocket launch site.**

The only thing missing is VOLUME. SPCE & TSLA look interesting but what we're seeing in GME is 5-star. Think maybe it's time we get the band back together.

Not advice, I just like the stock. Do you?

*As always, do your own due diligence. Knowing how to read charts can make you slightly more likely to catch break outs and mitigate losses but there is always uncertainty. Don't speculate with $ you can't afford to lose.*

Thus, the banks would no longer operate illegal and unlawful financing should they offer loans and other services to the companies. That would be a huge step in removing what analysts are calling an obstacle to the development of a national cannabis industry.

Legislators voted for the bill with 321-101 votes and sent it to the Senate.

https://preview.redd.it/5mpqdo4tja171.jpg?width=660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1255ec4f5a2471772ca27ad86ea25c16167d241b

The bill clarifies that proceeds from legal cannabis deals are not considered illegal and instructs federal regulators to create rules on how they would oversee such banking activities. Banks have so far been unwilling to do business with companies that sell marijuana or related products, fearing they could run into conflict with US federal law. This has left marijuana companies with few options to rely on a handful of small financial institutions or do cash deals. The American Bankers Association has aggressively lobbied for the SAFE Banking Act bill.

The banks have been in a difficult position due to the conflict between state and federal law, so it makes sense that Congress must act now to resolve this conflict. Thirty-six US states have now legalized medical cannabis, while 17 states already allow recreational use of cannabis by adults.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would try to push legislation. The positive reaction of the stock prices of Tilray, Sundial Growers, Aphria or Aurora Cannabis shows the great relief of investors. Investors hope that this could have kicked off further progressive reforms in the cannabis sector. This move took the potential of a game-changing marijuana law an important step forward.

If Congress passes the SAFE Banking Act and President Joe Biden signs it, it would likely become much easier and cheaper for marijuana companies to raise the capital they need to fund their growth initiatives. The law should also make cannabis companies safer and more efficient, as credit services would reduce the need for cash in day-to-day operations.

Currently the stock is down 15-20% from the opening bell. Who cares? Nobody is fever-buying IPOs like they were late last year or early this year. But this is actually the perfect time to buy in. Why? Well this IPO is actually occurring exactly when YouTube is just about to fuck over all of the business YouTube accounts in the USA.

What is YouTube doing to fuck over businesses? Well they are starting to run ads on non-partnered content. See source here, from the November terms of use update: [https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719)

If you don't want to read this, basically it says that channels that aren't partners are now going to get ads on their videos and YouTube is keeping ALL of the revenue (fuck you, right?). I've personally already witnessed this because I manage YT channels for several businesses and I've already gotten ads. And guess who gets a call every time their client sees an ad on their videos? Me, I get the call. 

&#x200B;

**When does this happen?**

It's already started. I've started seeing ads on corporate non-monetized and uncopyrighted videos within the last couple weeks, but the change is supposed to be implemented across the country in June. I've already been getting calls from my boss and from clients. We are already moving a lot of content to Vimeo.

&#x200B;

**Why does this matter?** 

Businesses are not going to be happy if their competitors are running ads on their videos. Especially if that ad occurs when the video is embedded on their own website. I know for a fact that ads are showing in YouTube but there has been no distinction that I'm aware of that would prohibit them from running ads in embedded videos on a website or blog. 

&#x200B;

**What is going to happen?**

If businesses start seeing competitor ads on their videos, they will do everything they can to stop it. They can either join the YPP and disable ads or they can leave the platform. However, there are requirements to the YPP:

1. They must have 1,000 subscribers
2. They must have 4,000 watch hours in the last 12 months

I can promise you that most businesses do not even come close to meeting these requirements. They can try to purchase subscribers or views but YouTube is good at identifying this. Trust me, I've gone down that road and have seen channels get taken down because of it.

&#x200B;

**Why is VMEO the best play here?**

The main reason is because businesses will leave YouTube.

Vimeo is hand-down my favorite video hosting service for a few reasons:

* The video encode quality is visibly better
* The embedded player is 100% customizable
* It's easier to pick thumbnails
* It has a built-in review system for businesses
* And the best feature, you can update videos without changing the URL (very helpful for embedding)

What's the drawback? It costs $7/month for most of these features. But businesses will gladly pay that to not have their competitors on their website/videos.

This is not a financial Advise,

RBLX has been on a bull run for past week and more. I wanted to to highlight few critical points here.

RBLX is approaching its resistance, Bearish in short term.  
It might fight $90 for 1 or 2 days, and then retrace to 21 ema (must be close to the ascending support line around $72) Wise decision would be to close a position now and re-enter at a lower price.  
Another data point to be cautions, analysts 12 month high price target - $90.

Trade cautiously, do your own DD.

5622,,2021-05-25 19:36:59,t3_nky421,,wallstreetbets,"So a week ago I bought 4K in options for ARKX and UFO.  It started when I had the prophetic revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector. And because increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I stopped smoking weed.  My first thought was that if the government doesn‚Äôt release the report then I‚Äôm fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report sometime in June. However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it‚Äôs another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  After every national emergency, such as saying this is foreign tech would be, it has caused defense contract stocks to go up 5-10%. Also many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.  Finally I looked up ufo on google trends today and it is up 3x its 12 month average.  Google trends have been shown to foresee increase in prices. So does this sound logical or am I a retarded ape?",nky421,Here‚Äôs some DD that WSB had been lacking

GME has been consolidating between the bag holders of the first and second peaks. As you can see, on average, nobody is bag holding now. This is good sign for bulls. I would expect a retest of the 195/200 range. If that holds, it's game on.

&#x200B;

Mods, this is a technical analysis post...not a freaking literary dissertation. Having a length requirement on a post that is obviously going to mostly consist of a picture is ridiculous. Bad Bot.

&#x200B;

If we really need to get this longer then why don't I explain the significance of VWAP. It stands for volume weighted average price. It basically shows the price normalized by the volumes of buyers and sellers that have bought/sold in the past. Why is this important? It's important because it more accurately indicates where there are zones of overhead supply (bag holders waiting to sell once they break even) or pent up demand (most holders are feeling good and waiting to buy dips). In this case, price has been stuck between the psychology of two market participants; the bag holders and the (not?) bag holders. Now that price is above both VWAP levels, more market participants are ITM than not ITM. This means less selling pressure. This means moon.

Hello Hivemind,

From a fundamentalist and technical analysis perspective, I predict with a high degree of certainty that there will be strong price action coming within the next month, and I believe it'll be upward momentum. Here's why:

Fundamentally.  
\-Earnings are in a month. Here we may have another chance at the possibility of seeing the FB settlement or selling of Huwaei patents  
\-Earnings should beat last quarter. I promise you this hack on Colonial pipeline puckered a lot of businesses anuses and companies must all be looking at the best possible ways to increase their end-to-end security, also the shoutout from the hacker Darkside recommending Cyclance (IF the texts were real) is bigger than you think. Also, those of you who are invested and or bag holding should have also subscribed to Cyclance for $29, every one of those subscriptions helps their bottom line.  
\-Increase in advertisements. A lot more sponsored ads coming up on Reddit, Twitter, and also in other forms from Blackberry.  
\-No publicity is bad publicity. We still get connected with Jim Cramer's ""Reddit Stocks"" list on TV, but our price action never moves that drastically in comparison to the S&P 500. I have no doubt in my mind those who actually do their research, follow the price action, and the news from this company they'll see what treasure lies in store, but they could be looking for a better entry price. Currently, the average price target from CNN is $8.76 and $BB is very close as of writing at $8.60. Analyst projections going from $4.60 to $20. Following analyst's opinions are not always a great indicator, but this helps my prediction that there will be some turbulence will be coming soon, up or down.  
\-Massive institutional investment. I cannot stress this enough. Go on Fintel.io and you'll see recent additions to their portfolios from names like:  
\-Citadel. Bought 1,400,000 shares this quarter. Net Long on calls and puts  
\-Great West Life Assurance - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of New York - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of Montreal - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Many others, such as PrimeCap, Fidelity, and Vanguard  
Institutions are getting in, and heavily. there is a possibility that the price was beaten or manipulated down so institutions may enter at a cheap price but that's a different conversation, this is a conversation about $BB and the large chance of a movement, not manipulation.

Technical analysis.

&#x200B;

From this picture, we can see how the Bollinger bands are tightening up immensely, and we are about to see a triple cross of the 20/50/200 DMA. Both of these are signals of a large movement in price and if institutions are getting in so recently I couldn't imagine it's going to tank much further.  
An interesting note to make is how nicely the candles follow the Bollinger bands up and down, as well as when they touch the 50/200 DMA. Once the two cross that'll be either our death or golden cross. Hard to say which way, but I'd suggest it's up with all these companies are increasing their portfolio of $BB by 30%+.

This is the reason why I believe this is the signal. Call it apophenia if you aren't into TA but it can be an incredible tool for establishing share price.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9avjw90ltb171.png?width=2181&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f8c005da597398a5c107c70ab62c72b61d6e467

This chart shows the significance of \~$8.60 from history going back to April 2017 on the farthest left. The green dotted line shows how many times it acted as support but as well as resistance.  
This makes our current price range very strong because of how many times BB has touched \~$8.60. There have been times where it has tested below but eventually it has propped itself back up so far every time. It acted as resistance during the first stage of the WSB rally in January, came back down, and that was the signal to the upside.  
The next signal to the upside is \~$14.51 because of the yellow line. That was resistance during the WSB rally in which the daily candle spiked up and as well as acted at resistance on Jan 18 and as well after the crash.  
If $BB breaks \~$14.51 and secures it, $BB may go parabolic again.

But what if it goes down?  
The next support line below \~$8.60 is \~$6.50. But that probably won't happen because of $BB's Enterprise value. As of writing based the enterprise value is $4.98B and in comparison, our market cap is $4.81B, which puts BB's enterprise value and market cap very close in line with each other.

Final notes:  
I believe with a very high degree of confidence that $BB is going to move up now and we've reached very close to the bottom. I understand that it is impossible to predict the market but with these tools, research, my personal understanding of the market and its psychology involved, I think that $BB is primed and the uptrend may begin.

I am not your financial advisor. I am not a professional. I am only a mere student of the game which is life and the market.

I hold 2000 shares of BB and will be adding upon confirmation of the upside.

Inflation matters because if inflation numbers come out just as high as last time, it will give more credence to the people screaming runaway inflation.

Runaway inflation is really bad because it will force the federal reserve to raise rates.

With an ATM program, companies quietly sell stock into the open market at prevailing prices, and the amount of proceeds that are ultimately raised depend on what prices the shares are sold for. There are currently approximately 450.3 million shares outstanding, so 43 million additional shares would represent roughly 9.5% dilution.

""We have previously pointed out that the sale of up to 43 million AMC shares, the currently available amount for possible issuance under a previous shareholder authorization, should more than satisfy AMC's liquidity needs for 2021,"" CEO Adam Aron commented in a release. ""This assumes an expected recovery in the patronage of movie theatres in the second half of this year.""

I think AMC will hit 5 dollars again by end of summer. The reason I think this is because who tf is really trying to go to the movies with masks on in the heat to see movies that are being released on streaming platforms anyway. This whole ape stuff is stupid and people are losing money left and right from it. I‚Äôve gotten so many DM‚Äôs from apes most of you have small dicks so stop trying seriously.

Theoretically speaking, each share of AMC in and of itself is worth more than 1 most expensive fake internet money coin, so retail can prop it up to thousands of dollars. AMC and GME can exist and produce nothing as long as retail provides them with limitless money well via share dilution. When you buy this stock you assume the same risks like buying crypto - that shit can swing wildly and no one knows in which direction.

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Their next earnings are slated for 6/10/21 after market close.

The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don‚Äôt think it holds up with Zillow. I know their software is great for their agents on the backend, but not into it as a consumer. Overall I like it as a long-term play.

6985,,2021-05-25 02:00:02,t3_nkedem,,wallstreetbets,"I want to preface this by saying that I‚Äôm primarily a value investor (although many of my clients do own growth stocks) so my area of expertise isn‚Äôt necessarily on growth stocks like PENN. With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can‚Äôt necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what‚Äôs to come. So, let‚Äôs take a look at PENN‚Äôs growth. 

In 2015 Penn‚Äôs revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN‚Äôs revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN‚Äôs debt to asset ratio of 80% isn‚Äôt terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN‚Äôs partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

Thanks for reading this. If you liked my analysis and are curious about a company‚Äôs value, feel free to let me know.",nkedem,Should you bet on PENN?

For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC‚Äôs Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,The PLUG Restatement: A Great Chance to Get Out

Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.¬† There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".¬† The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.¬† Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.¬† In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.¬† In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.¬†   


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.¬† While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?¬† Good question.¬† I don't know yet.¬† Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.¬† Another good question.¬† I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?¬† The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.¬† They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.¬† This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.¬† *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**¬†   


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.¬† And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?¬† I don't know, but here's a scary graph.¬† So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.¬† Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.¬† Not significantly.¬† After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.¬† So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.¬† Doesn't seem like much.¬† But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.¬† I went down another rabbit hole.¬† 1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?¬† The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.¬† Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.¬† Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).¬† It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.¬† After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.¬† And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.¬† When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?¬† A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.¬† But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.¬† 

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.¬† Short the S&P there.  


Or you could just go to the source, nevermind, retail traders can't get any accurate, up to date, actionable market data.  You can go to the fed, but it's 3 days late.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

**This week's things to watch for:**

  
Tomorrow we also get the results from the Richmond manufacturing index and Consumer confidence.¬† 

Last week, the Empire Index was up (barely) though the prices paid were higher (higher inflation).¬† The Philly index was down, and prices paid were at 40 year highs.¬† Tomorrow is Richmond.¬† Where the fuck is Richmond?  Thursday is unemployment claims, and Friday is another print of CPI.¬† But it's on a holiday weekend.¬† So responses should be muted.¬† If bad, look for a bloody Tuesday.¬† If good, fuck it, why not?  All time highs again.

In short, no.

SelfWealth members have been allowed to buy and sell GME as  well as others like AMC, throughout the entirety of 2021. This is in  stark comparison to other platforms that entirely halted the trading of  certain stocks.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

my god..

and also they retain the voting rights?! i want out but i dont know who else allows buying of gme and amc... i had a stake account but they stopped letting people buy shares back in January and that's when i got into selfwealth and have been ever since but finding this out today is quiet frightening..

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME ‚Äì  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.¬† These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",nkk4c1,where to buy GME stocks in Australia?! SelfWealth is evil and stake was dodgy!

you can legally yolo all your money into a horrible option, and you can become a homeless person or billionaire at any given time. What is the difference between these 2 groups, well to me it is structure.

&#x200B;

You may be saying, 'well I have my trading system so I am good right?', no - you are not. You are missing 50% of the equation. Hear me out:

&#x200B;

A trading STRUCTURE is what should house, or literally be the roof and foundation for your SYSTEM. Imagine a trading system being a furnace, it cannot keep you warm and safe without a roof, walls, and foundation. So, what is my structure and system; here ya go:

&#x200B;

Trading Structure (Literal Home):

**Foundation**: Risk Management - All decisions, all other elements, and all trades are GROUNDED in risk management. I get it, 'Apes Stick Together' or whatever, but I use stop losses - I enter every trade with a set loss and take profit. I do not get emotional, I have a plan, and each trade is a 3 reward to 1 risk setup at least for a small move.

**Walls**: I base my 4 balls of success on:

1. 3 Analysis: 
   1. **Fundamental Analysis** based on news, P/E Ratio, Floats, EPS, etc. 
   2. **Technical Analysis** based on charts, graphs, value. If you are one of those 'AsTrOlOgY fOr IdIoTs' people, fine but understand you are handicapping yourself due to your own ego.
   3. **Mental Analysis** based on confidence, execution, and planning.
2. **Macro Economic** moves like inflation rates, money supply, consumer confidence; and Indexes like S&P, Nasdaq, DOW30, Russell2000, etc. I also study the 11 sectors intently too.
3. **Trading Plan** that includes a stop loss, a loading or buying zone, a price target, and an exit strategy and entry strategy already planned.
4. **Goal Setting** for my 1 month, 6 month, 1 year, 5 year, etc.... and what each trade does to help these goals.

From there my '**ROOF**' or my added protection is consistency. I stick to these rules. Before every trade, I double check with my 'roof' that I am being consistent. When I am in a trade, I check to make sure I am being consistent. When I exit - guess what, I check I am being consistent.

There will be some nights we would all enjoy and actually benefit from not having a roof. Those 73 degree, sunny days come - and we may enjoy sleeping in a tent or even sleeping with the sound of toad ribbits and cricket songs, and we give that up. We do because there are also hurricane level monsoons and without a roof, your whole room will be ruined (blowing up your account).

From there, you place your SYSTEM in this STRUCTURE. Scalping, great. Day trader, beautiful. Swing, long term, only ETF, dividends!? That is fine. Anytime frame, any short term goal, and account size; all of the things that make your TRADING EDGE or SYSTEM goes into the STRUCUTRE.

I want to call attention to the fact that GME has been consolidating for 2 months and looks just about ready to launch. Check the chart below courtesy of traderstewie. For months GME has been tightening and building higher lows on the daily and weekly. The key level to break out of the wedge is \~190 which we're pretty much exactly at now. Above $190 the path looks open to $300+.

**What I'm saying my friends is that GME is starting to look like a rocket launch site.**

The only thing missing is VOLUME. SPCE & TSLA look interesting but what we're seeing in GME is 5-star. Think maybe it's time we get the band back together.

Not advice, I just like the stock. Do you?

**Update (7:45pm) -**

**The apes won this battle but this is just the beginning. Don't believe the media if they talk about a squeeze. The squeeze has not squoze. You'll know it's squeezing when the price shoots up dramatically. And each squeeze makes the next one more likely. Don't expect a smooth ride but GME has serious upside here.**

(I'm waiting on an explanation from Reddit why they banned my account just as GME's stock began to run but suffice it to say it's suspicious. I'll use the reddit handle u/hedge_hiker for now.)

*As always, do your own due diligence. Knowing how to read charts can make you slightly more likely to catch break outs and mitigate losses but there is always uncertainty. Don't speculate with $ you can't afford to lose.*

Thus, the banks would no longer operate illegal and unlawful financing should they offer loans and other services to the companies. That would be a huge step in removing what analysts are calling an obstacle to the development of a national cannabis industry.

Legislators voted for the bill with 321-101 votes and sent it to the Senate.

https://preview.redd.it/5mpqdo4tja171.jpg?width=660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1255ec4f5a2471772ca27ad86ea25c16167d241b

The bill clarifies that proceeds from legal cannabis deals are not considered illegal and instructs federal regulators to create rules on how they would oversee such banking activities. Banks have so far been unwilling to do business with companies that sell marijuana or related products, fearing they could run into conflict with US federal law. This has left marijuana companies with few options to rely on a handful of small financial institutions or do cash deals. The American Bankers Association has aggressively lobbied for the SAFE Banking Act bill.

The banks have been in a difficult position due to the conflict between state and federal law, so it makes sense that Congress must act now to resolve this conflict. Thirty-six US states have now legalized medical cannabis, while 17 states already allow recreational use of cannabis by adults.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would try to push legislation. The positive reaction of the stock prices of Tilray, Sundial Growers, Aphria or Aurora Cannabis shows the great relief of investors. Investors hope that this could have kicked off further progressive reforms in the cannabis sector. This move took the potential of a game-changing marijuana law an important step forward.

If Congress passes the SAFE Banking Act and President Joe Biden signs it, it would likely become much easier and cheaper for marijuana companies to raise the capital they need to fund their growth initiatives. The law should also make cannabis companies safer and more efficient, as credit services would reduce the need for cash in day-to-day operations.

Currently the stock is down 15-20% from the opening bell. Who cares? Nobody is fever-buying IPOs like they were late last year or early this year. But this is actually the perfect time to buy in. Why? Well this IPO is actually occurring exactly when YouTube is just about to fuck over all of the business YouTube accounts in the USA.

What is YouTube doing to fuck over businesses? Well they are starting to run ads on non-partnered content. See source here, from the November terms of use update: [https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719)

If you don't want to read this, basically it says that channels that aren't partners are now going to get ads on their videos and YouTube is keeping ALL of the revenue (fuck you, right?). I've personally already witnessed this because I manage YT channels for several businesses and I've already gotten ads. And guess who gets a call every time their client sees an ad on their videos? Me, I get the call. 

&#x200B;

**When does this happen?**

It's already started. I've started seeing ads on corporate non-monetized and uncopyrighted videos within the last couple weeks, but the change is supposed to be implemented across the country in June. I've already been getting calls from my boss and from clients. We are already moving a lot of content to Vimeo.

&#x200B;

**Why does this matter?** 

Businesses are not going to be happy if their competitors are running ads on their videos. Especially if that ad occurs when the video is embedded on their own website. I know for a fact that ads are showing in YouTube but there has been no distinction that I'm aware of that would prohibit them from running ads in embedded videos on a website or blog. 

&#x200B;

**What is going to happen?**

If businesses start seeing competitor ads on their videos, they will do everything they can to stop it. They can either join the YPP and disable ads or they can leave the platform. However, there are requirements to the YPP:

1. They must have 1,000 subscribers
2. They must have 4,000 watch hours in the last 12 months

I can promise you that most businesses do not even come close to meeting these requirements. They can try to purchase subscribers or views but YouTube is good at identifying this. Trust me, I've gone down that road and have seen channels get taken down because of it.

&#x200B;

**Why is VMEO the best play here?**

The main reason is because businesses will leave YouTube.

Vimeo is hand-down my favorite video hosting service for a few reasons:

* The video encode quality is visibly better
* The embedded player is 100% customizable
* It's easier to pick thumbnails
* It has a built-in review system for businesses
* And the best feature, you can update videos without changing the URL (very helpful for embedding)

What's the drawback? It costs $7/month for most of these features. But businesses will gladly pay that to not have their competitors on their website/videos.

This is not a financial Advise,

RBLX has been on a bull run for past week and more. I wanted to to highlight few critical points here.

RBLX is approaching its resistance, Bearish in short term.  
It might fight $90 for 1 or 2 days, and then retrace to 21 ema (must be close to the ascending support line around $72) Wise decision would be to close a position now and re-enter at a lower price.  
Another data point to be cautions, analysts 12 month high price target - $90.

It started when I had the prophetic revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector. And because increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I stopped smoking weed.  My first thought was that if the government doesn‚Äôt release the report then I‚Äôm fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report sometime in June. However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it‚Äôs another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  After every national emergency, such as saying this is foreign tech would be, it has caused defense contract stocks to go up 5-10%. Also many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.

GME has been consolidating between the bag holders of the first and second peaks. As you can see, on average, nobody is bag holding now. This is good sign for bulls. I would expect a retest of the 195/200 range. If that holds, it's game on.

Mods, this is a technical analysis post...not a freaking literary dissertation. Having a length requirement on a post that is obviously going to mostly consist of a picture is ridiculous. Bad Bot.

&#x200B;

If we really need to get this longer then why don't I explain the significance of VWAP. It stands for volume weighted average price. It basically shows the price normalized by the volumes of buyers and sellers that have bought/sold in the past. Why is this important? It's important because it more accurately indicates where there are zones of overhead supply (bag holders waiting to sell once they break even) or pent up demand (most holders are feeling good and waiting to buy dips). In this case, price has been stuck between the psychology of two market participants; the bag holders and the (not?) bag holders. Now that price is above both VWAP levels, more market participants are ITM than not ITM. This means less selling pressure. This means moon.

Hello Hivemind,

From a fundamentalist and technical analysis perspective, I predict with a high degree of certainty that there will be strong price action coming within the next month, and I believe it'll be upward momentum. Here's why:

Fundamentally.  
\-Earnings are in a month. Here we may have another chance at the possibility of seeing the FB settlement or selling of Huwaei patents  
\-Earnings should beat last quarter. I promise you this hack on Colonial pipeline puckered a lot of businesses anuses and companies must all be looking at the best possible ways to increase their end-to-end security, also the shoutout from the hacker Darkside recommending Cyclance (IF the texts were real) is bigger than you think. Also, those of you who are invested and or bag holding should have also subscribed to Cyclance for $29, every one of those subscriptions helps their bottom line.  
\-Increase in advertisements. A lot more sponsored ads coming up on Reddit, Twitter, and also in other forms from Blackberry.  
\-No publicity is bad publicity. We still get connected with Jim Cramer's ""Reddit Stocks"" list on TV, but our price action never moves that drastically in comparison to the S&P 500. I have no doubt in my mind those who actually do their research, follow the price action, and the news from this company they'll see what treasure lies in store, but they could be looking for a better entry price. Currently, the average price target from CNN is $8.76 and $BB is very close as of writing at $8.60. Analyst projections going from $4.60 to $20. Following analyst's opinions are not always a great indicator, but this helps my prediction that there will be some turbulence will be coming soon, up or down.  
\-Massive institutional investment. I cannot stress this enough. Go on Fintel.io and you'll see recent additions to their portfolios from names like:  
\-Citadel. Bought 1,400,000 shares this quarter. Net Long on calls and puts  
\-Great West Life Assurance - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of New York - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of Montreal - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Many others, such as PrimeCap, Fidelity, and Vanguard  
Institutions are getting in, and heavily. there is a possibility that the price was beaten or manipulated down so institutions may enter at a cheap price but that's a different conversation, this is a conversation about $BB and the large chance of a movement, not manipulation.

Technical analysis.

From this picture, we can see how the Bollinger bands are tightening up immensely, and we are about to see a triple cross of the 20/50/200 DMA. Both of these are signals of a large movement in price and if institutions are getting in so recently I couldn't imagine it's going to tank much further.  
An interesting note to make is how nicely the candles follow the Bollinger bands up and down, as well as when they touch the 50/200 DMA. Once the two cross that'll be either our death or golden cross. Hard to say which way, but I'd suggest it's up with all these companies are increasing their portfolio of $BB by 30%+.

This is the reason why I believe this is the signal. Call it apophenia if you aren't into TA but it can be an incredible tool for establishing share price.

This chart shows the significance of \~$8.60 from history going back to April 2017 on the farthest left. The green dotted line shows how many times it acted as support but as well as resistance.  
This makes our current price range very strong because of how many times BB has touched \~$8.60. There have been times where it has tested below but eventually it has propped itself back up so far every time. It acted as resistance during the first stage of the WSB rally in January, came back down, and that was the signal to the upside.  
The next signal to the upside is \~$14.51 because of the yellow line. That was resistance during the WSB rally in which the daily candle spiked up and as well as acted at resistance on Jan 18 and as well after the crash.  
If $BB breaks \~$14.51 and secures it, $BB may go parabolic again.

But what if it goes down?  
The next support line below \~$8.60 is \~$6.50. But that probably won't happen because of $BB's Enterprise value. As of writing based the enterprise value is $4.98B and in comparison, our market cap is $4.81B, which puts BB's enterprise value and market cap very close in line with each other.

Final notes:  
I believe with a very high degree of confidence that $BB is going to move up now and we've reached very close to the bottom. I understand that it is impossible to predict the market but with these tools, research, my personal understanding of the market and its psychology involved, I think that $BB is primed and the uptrend may begin.

I am not your financial advisor. I am not a professional. I am only a mere student of the game which is life and the market.

I hold 2000 shares of BB and will be adding upon confirmation of the upside.

Ford‚Äôs plan to invest in EVs and self-driving cars rose to $29 billion, including $22 billion for EVs through 2025. 

Ford and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL are entering a six-year deal that will make the tech giant responsible for much of Ford‚Äôs growing in-vehicle connectivity. This partnership is designed to streamline Ford‚Äôs operations and accelerate an ongoing $11 billion restructuring plan. 

General Motors:

General Motors announced that it plans to invest $27 billion in EV and autonomous vehicles through 2025. The company also mentioned that it plans to release 30 EV models globally by 2025.

The company has partnered with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT in leading a $2 billion investment round in self-driving car startup Cruise LLC.

Difference:
Ford is going with Google and General Motors is going with Microsoft. 

Google has 14 Automotive startup investments and Acquisitions.

Microsoft only has investments in 4 automotive startups.

This will help Ford and General Motors in the following areas:

- Autonomous driving technology.
- Connected car tech & fleet management.
- Electric vehicle technology.
- Automotive retail.
- Mobility-as-a-service & shared mobility.

Who wins?
In this situation Ford has the better outlook, Google with 14 different Automotive startups to do its project development for Ford, also Google has access to Android and will give Ford the ability to integrate mobile connectivity to their cars.

CPI = measure of inflation

Inflation matters because if inflation numbers come out just as high as last time, it will give more credence to the people screaming runaway inflation.

Runaway inflation is really bad because it will force the federal reserve to raise rates.

When rates rise, risk assets go poof.

Stocks and coins will either finally be dead or return to the atmosphere on this day.

Be aware that shit will turn you into a bagholder. It will set an unreasonable price anchor in your head that will make you make bad choices and not get out when you should.

Take it from someone who missed out on $100,000+ GME gains because I got it into my head that ""$1000 is not a meme"" -- maybe it's not...but if you've got options that expire, it sure as shit is. 

DTE is *meaningless* when the top will be fleeting. And there will be a top. 

Nobody knows what it will be, but trust me, the feeling of missing out on some extra gains because you sold ""too early"" is **WAY WAY** less terrible than bagholding and watching 80%+ of your gains evaporate when the rug gets pulled. It will haunt you forever.

Stairs up, elevator down...it's not going to just fizzle out slowly. People saying ""wait for the top and sell on the way down"" are either idiots or want you to hold their bags. Go look at GME charts for 1/27 and 3/10...hell, look at the AMC chart for 1/27...it wasn't pretty and not having an exit strategy has fucked me up mentally for months.",,

I decided to retire this investment and use it to buy 500 shares of BNGO at about $5.54. I then sold 5 $6 June 18, covered calls for $245 premium which will cover my monthly hooker expense, for legal reasons that's a joke. Already I earned 70% of what QYLD would have payed me in a year.

 If my calls expire in the money then I'll make about a $300 profit for a total $545 profit in just one month. Then I'll just sell some cash covered puts then rinse and repeat. If the calls expire OTM then it's another monthly covered calls. I truly believe in BNGO which is why I have about 200 other calls on the side for the long term.

The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don‚Äôt think it holds up with Zillow.

With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can‚Äôt necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what‚Äôs to come. So, let‚Äôs take a look at PENN‚Äôs growth. 

In 2015 Penn‚Äôs revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN‚Äôs revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN‚Äôs debt to asset ratio of 80% isn‚Äôt terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN‚Äôs partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC‚Äôs Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,The PLUG Restatement: A Great Chance to Get Out

Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.¬† There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".¬† The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.¬† Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.¬† In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.¬† In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.¬†   


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.¬† While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?¬† Good question.¬† I don't know yet.¬† Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.¬† Another good question.¬† I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?¬† The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.¬† They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.¬† This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.¬† *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**¬†   


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.¬† And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?¬† I don't know, but here's a scary graph.¬† So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.¬† Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.¬† Not significantly.¬† After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.¬† So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.¬† Doesn't seem like much.¬† But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.¬† I went down another rabbit hole.¬† 1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?¬† The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.¬† Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.¬† Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).¬† It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.¬† After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.¬† And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.¬† When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?¬† A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.¬† But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.¬† 

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.¬† Short the S&P there.  


Or you could just go to the source, nevermind, retail traders can't get any accurate, up to date, actionable market data.  You can go to the fed, but it's 3 days late.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

**This week's things to watch for:**

  
Tomorrow we also get the results from the Richmond manufacturing index and Consumer confidence.¬† 

Last week, the Empire Index was up (barely) though the prices paid were higher (higher inflation).¬† The Philly index was down, and prices paid were at 40 year highs.¬† Tomorrow is Richmond.¬† Where the fuck is Richmond?  Thursday is unemployment claims, and Friday is another print of CPI.¬† But it's on a holiday weekend.¬† So responses should be muted.¬† If bad, look for a bloody Tuesday.¬† If good, fuck it, why not?

In short, no.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME ‚Äì  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.¬† These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",nkk4c1,where to buy GME stocks in Australia?! SelfWealth is evil and stake was dodgy!

you can legally yolo all your money into a horrible option, and you can become a homeless person or billionaire at any given time. What is the difference between these 2 groups, well to me it is structure.

&#x200B;

You may be saying, 'well I have my trading system so I am good right?', no - you are not. You are missing 50% of the equation. Hear me out:

&#x200B;

A trading STRUCTURE is what should house, or literally be the roof and foundation for your SYSTEM. Imagine a trading system being a furnace, it cannot keep you warm and safe without a roof, walls, and foundation. So, what is my structure and system; here ya go:

&#x200B;

Trading Structure (Literal Home):

**Foundation**: Risk Management - All decisions, all other elements, and all trades are GROUNDED in risk management. I get it, 'Apes Stick Together' or whatever, but I use stop losses - I enter every trade with a set loss and take profit. I do not get emotional, I have a plan, and each trade is a 3 reward to 1 risk setup at least for a small move.

**Walls**: I base my 4 balls of success on:

1. 3 Analysis: 
   1. **Fundamental Analysis** based on news, P/E Ratio, Floats, EPS, etc. 
   2. **Technical Analysis** based on charts, graphs, value. If you are one of those 'AsTrOlOgY fOr IdIoTs' people, fine but understand you are handicapping yourself due to your own ego.
   3. **Mental Analysis** based on confidence, execution, and planning.
2. **Macro Economic** moves like inflation rates, money supply, consumer confidence; and Indexes like S&P, Nasdaq, DOW30, Russell2000, etc. I also study the 11 sectors intently too.
3. **Trading Plan** that includes a stop loss, a loading or buying zone, a price target, and an exit strategy and entry strategy already planned.
4. **Goal Setting** for my 1 month, 6 month, 1 year, 5 year, etc.... and what each trade does to help these goals.

From there my '**ROOF**' or my added protection is consistency. I stick to these rules. Before every trade, I double check with my 'roof' that I am being consistent. When I am in a trade, I check to make sure I am being consistent. When I exit - guess what, I check I am being consistent.

There will be some nights we would all enjoy and actually benefit from not having a roof. Those 73 degree, sunny days come - and we may enjoy sleeping in a tent or even sleeping with the sound of toad ribbits and cricket songs, and we give that up. We do because there are also hurricane level monsoons and without a roof, your whole room will be ruined (blowing up your account).

&#x200B;

From there, you place your SYSTEM in this STRUCTURE. Scalping, great. Day trader, beautiful. Swing, long term, only ETF, dividends!? That is fine. Anytime frame, any short term goal, and account size; all of the things that make your TRADING EDGE or SYSTEM goes into the STRUCUTRE.

&#x200B;

Please have both. Please have rules. Please understand you are in a chaotic neutral system, with 0 rules, 0 guidance, 0 anything. You either create your own structure, or have none. You fail to plan, than you're planning to fail. Good luck.",nkq9et,The Difference Between A Trading Structure And A Trading System

I want to call attention to the fact that GME has been consolidating for 2 months and looks just about ready to launch. Check the chart below courtesy of traderstewie. For months GME has been tightening and building higher lows on the daily and weekly. The key level to break out of the wedge is \~190 which we're pretty much exactly at now. Above $190 the path looks open to $300+.

**What I'm saying my friends is that GME is starting to look like a rocket launch site.**

The only thing missing is VOLUME. SPCE & TSLA look interesting but what we're seeing in GME is 5-star. Think maybe it's time we get the band back together.

Not advice, I just like the stock. Do you?

**Update (7:45pm) -**

**The apes won this battle but this is just the beginning. Don't believe the media if they talk about a squeeze. The squeeze has not squoze. You'll know it's squeezing when the price shoots up dramatically. And each squeeze makes the next one more likely. Don't expect a smooth ride but GME has serious upside here.**

(I'm waiting on an explanation from Reddit why they banned my account just as GME's stock began to run but suffice it to say it's suspicious. FWIW I'm using the handle ""hedge\_hiker"" now.)

Thus, the banks would no longer operate illegal and unlawful financing should they offer loans and other services to the companies. That would be a huge step in removing what analysts are calling an obstacle to the development of a national cannabis industry.

Legislators voted for the bill with 321-101 votes and sent it to the Senate.

https://preview.redd.it/5mpqdo4tja171.jpg?width=660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1255ec4f5a2471772ca27ad86ea25c16167d241b

The bill clarifies that proceeds from legal cannabis deals are not considered illegal and instructs federal regulators to create rules on how they would oversee such banking activities. Banks have so far been unwilling to do business with companies that sell marijuana or related products, fearing they could run into conflict with US federal law. This has left marijuana companies with few options to rely on a handful of small financial institutions or do cash deals. The American Bankers Association has aggressively lobbied for the SAFE Banking Act bill.

The banks have been in a difficult position due to the conflict between state and federal law, so it makes sense that Congress must act now to resolve this conflict. Thirty-six US states have now legalized medical cannabis, while 17 states already allow recreational use of cannabis by adults.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would try to push legislation. The positive reaction of the stock prices of Tilray, Sundial Growers, Aphria or Aurora Cannabis shows the great relief of investors. Investors hope that this could have kicked off further progressive reforms in the cannabis sector. This move took the potential of a game-changing marijuana law an important step forward.

If Congress passes the SAFE Banking Act and President Joe Biden signs it, it would likely become much easier and cheaper for marijuana companies to raise the capital they need to fund their growth initiatives. The law should also make cannabis companies safer and more efficient, as credit services would reduce the need for cash in day-to-day operations.

Currently the stock is down 15-20% from the opening bell. Who cares? Nobody is fever-buying IPOs like they were late last year or early this year. But this is actually the perfect time to buy in. Why? Well this IPO is actually occurring exactly when YouTube is just about to fuck over all of the business YouTube accounts in the USA.

What is YouTube doing to fuck over businesses? Well they are starting to run ads on non-partnered content. See source here, from the November terms of use update: [https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719)

If you don't want to read this, basically it says that channels that aren't partners are now going to get ads on their videos and YouTube is keeping ALL of the revenue (fuck you, right?). I've personally already witnessed this because I manage YT channels for several businesses and I've already gotten ads. And guess who gets a call every time their client sees an ad on their videos? Me, I get the call. 

&#x200B;

**When does this happen?**

It's already started. I've started seeing ads on corporate non-monetized and uncopyrighted videos within the last couple weeks, but the change is supposed to be implemented across the country in June. I've already been getting calls from my boss and from clients. We are already moving a lot of content to Vimeo.

&#x200B;

**Why does this matter?** 

Businesses are not going to be happy if their competitors are running ads on their videos. Especially if that ad occurs when the video is embedded on their own website. I know for a fact that ads are showing in YouTube but there has been no distinction that I'm aware of that would prohibit them from running ads in embedded videos on a website or blog. 

&#x200B;

**What is going to happen?**

If businesses start seeing competitor ads on their videos, they will do everything they can to stop it. They can either join the YPP and disable ads or they can leave the platform. However, there are requirements to the YPP:

1. They must have 1,000 subscribers
2. They must have 4,000 watch hours in the last 12 months

I can promise you that most businesses do not even come close to meeting these requirements. They can try to purchase subscribers or views but YouTube is good at identifying this. Trust me, I've gone down that road and have seen channels get taken down because of it.

&#x200B;

**Why is VMEO the best play here?**

The main reason is because businesses will leave YouTube.

Vimeo is hand-down my favorite video hosting service for a few reasons:

* The video encode quality is visibly better
* The embedded player is 100% customizable
* It's easier to pick thumbnails
* It has a built-in review system for businesses
* And the best feature, you can update videos without changing the URL (very helpful for embedding)

What's the drawback? It costs $7/month for most of these features. But businesses will gladly pay that to not have their competitors on their website/videos.

This is not a financial Advise,

RBLX has been on a bull run for past week and more. I wanted to to highlight few critical points here.

RBLX is approaching its resistance, Bearish in short term.  
It might fight $90 for 1 or 2 days, and then retrace to 21 ema (must be close to the ascending support line around $72) Wise decision would be to close a position now and re-enter at a lower price.  
Another data point to be cautions, analysts 12 month high price target - $90.

Trade cautiously, do your own DD.

7617,,2021-05-25 19:36:59,t3_nky421,,wallstreetbets,"So a week ago I bought 4K in options for ARKX and UFO.  It started when I had the prophetic revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector. And because increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I stopped smoking weed.  My first thought was that if the government doesn‚Äôt release the report then I‚Äôm fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report sometime in June. However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it‚Äôs another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  After every national emergency, such as saying this is foreign tech would be, it has caused defense contract stocks to go up 5-10%. Also many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.  Finally I looked up ufo on google trends today and it is up 3x its 12 month average.  Google trends have been shown to foresee increase in prices. So does this sound logical or am I a retarded ape?",nky421,Here‚Äôs some DD that WSB had been lacking

GME has been consolidating between the bag holders of the first and second peaks. As you can see, on average, nobody is bag holding now. This is good sign for bulls. I would expect a retest of the 195/200 range. If that holds, it's game on.

&#x200B;

Mods, this is a technical analysis post...not a freaking literary dissertation. Having a length requirement on a post that is obviously going to mostly consist of a picture is ridiculous. Bad Bot.

&#x200B;

If we really need to get this longer then why don't I explain the significance of VWAP. It stands for volume weighted average price. It basically shows the price normalized by the volumes of buyers and sellers that have bought/sold in the past. Why is this important? It's important because it more accurately indicates where there are zones of overhead supply (bag holders waiting to sell once they break even) or pent up demand (most holders are feeling good and waiting to buy dips). In this case, price has been stuck between the psychology of two market participants; the bag holders and the (not?) bag holders. Now that price is above both VWAP levels, more market participants are ITM than not ITM. This means less selling pressure. This means moon.

Hello Hivemind,

From a fundamentalist and technical analysis perspective, I predict with a high degree of certainty that there will be strong price action coming within the next month, and I believe it'll be upward momentum. Here's why:

Fundamentally.  
\-Earnings are in a month. Here we may have another chance at the possibility of seeing the FB settlement or selling of Huwaei patents  
\-Earnings should beat last quarter. I promise you this hack on Colonial pipeline puckered a lot of businesses anuses and companies must all be looking at the best possible ways to increase their end-to-end security, also the shoutout from the hacker Darkside recommending Cyclance (IF the texts were real) is bigger than you think. Also, those of you who are invested and or bag holding should have also subscribed to Cyclance for $29, every one of those subscriptions helps their bottom line.  
\-Increase in advertisements. A lot more sponsored ads coming up on Reddit, Twitter, and also in other forms from Blackberry.  
\-No publicity is bad publicity. We still get connected with Jim Cramer's ""Reddit Stocks"" list on TV, but our price action never moves that drastically in comparison to the S&P 500. I have no doubt in my mind those who actually do their research, follow the price action, and the news from this company they'll see what treasure lies in store, but they could be looking for a better entry price. Currently, the average price target from CNN is $8.76 and $BB is very close as of writing at $8.60. Analyst projections going from $4.60 to $20. Following analyst's opinions are not always a great indicator, but this helps my prediction that there will be some turbulence will be coming soon, up or down.  
\-Massive institutional investment. I cannot stress this enough. Go on Fintel.io and you'll see recent additions to their portfolios from names like:  
\-Citadel. Bought 1,400,000 shares this quarter. Net Long on calls and puts  
\-Great West Life Assurance - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of New York - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of Montreal - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Many others, such as PrimeCap, Fidelity, and Vanguard  
Institutions are getting in, and heavily. there is a possibility that the price was beaten or manipulated down so institutions may enter at a cheap price but that's a different conversation, this is a conversation about $BB and the large chance of a movement, not manipulation.

Technical analysis.

&#x200B;

From this picture, we can see how the Bollinger bands are tightening up immensely, and we are about to see a triple cross of the 20/50/200 DMA. Both of these are signals of a large movement in price and if institutions are getting in so recently I couldn't imagine it's going to tank much further.  
An interesting note to make is how nicely the candles follow the Bollinger bands up and down, as well as when they touch the 50/200 DMA. Once the two cross that'll be either our death or golden cross. Hard to say which way, but I'd suggest it's up with all these companies are increasing their portfolio of $BB by 30%+.

This is the reason why I believe this is the signal. Call it apophenia if you aren't into TA but it can be an incredible tool for establishing share price.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9avjw90ltb171.png?width=2181&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f8c005da597398a5c107c70ab62c72b61d6e467

This chart shows the significance of \~$8.60 from history going back to April 2017 on the farthest left. The green dotted line shows how many times it acted as support but as well as resistance.  
This makes our current price range very strong because of how many times BB has touched \~$8.60. There have been times where it has tested below but eventually it has propped itself back up so far every time. It acted as resistance during the first stage of the WSB rally in January, came back down, and that was the signal to the upside.  
The next signal to the upside is \~$14.51 because of the yellow line. That was resistance during the WSB rally in which the daily candle spiked up and as well as acted at resistance on Jan 18 and as well after the crash.  
If $BB breaks \~$14.51 and secures it, $BB may go parabolic again.

But what if it goes down?  
The next support line below \~$8.60 is \~$6.50. But that probably won't happen because of $BB's Enterprise value. As of writing based the enterprise value is $4.98B and in comparison, our market cap is $4.81B, which puts BB's enterprise value and market cap very close in line with each other.

Final notes:  
I believe with a very high degree of confidence that $BB is going to move up now and we've reached very close to the bottom. I understand that it is impossible to predict the market but with these tools, research, my personal understanding of the market and its psychology involved, I think that $BB is primed and the uptrend may begin.

I am not your financial advisor. I am not a professional. I am only a mere student of the game which is life and the market.

I hold 2000 shares of BB and will be adding upon confirmation of the upside.

Google has 14 Automotive startup investments and Acquisitions.

Microsoft only has investments in 4 automotive startups.

- Autonomous driving technology.
- Connected car tech & fleet management.
- Electric vehicle technology.
- Automotive retail.
- Mobility-as-a-service & shared mobility.

In this situation Ford has the better outlook, Google with 14 different Automotive startups to do its project development for Ford, also Google has access to Android and will give Ford the ability to integrate mobile connectivity to their cars.

Inflation matters because if inflation numbers come out just as high as last time, it will give more credence to the people screaming runaway inflation.

Runaway inflation is really bad because it will force the federal reserve to raise rates.

When rates rise, risk assets go poof.

7640,,2021-05-25 23:32:00,t3_nl311m,,wallstreetbets,"AMC has filed to conduct an ""at-the-market"" (ATM) equity offering to issue and sell 43 million shares. With an ATM program, companies quietly sell stock into the open market at prevailing prices, and the amount of proceeds that are ultimately raised depend on what prices the shares are sold for. There are currently approximately 450.3 million shares outstanding, so 43 million additional shares would represent roughly 9.5% dilution.

""We have previously pointed out that the sale of up to 43 million AMC shares, the currently available amount for possible issuance under a previous shareholder authorization, should more than satisfy AMC's liquidity needs for 2021,"" CEO Adam Aron commented in a release. ""This assumes an expected recovery in the patronage of movie theatres in the second half of this year.""

I think AMC will hit 5 dollars again by end of summer. The reason I think this is because who tf is really trying to go to the movies with masks on in the heat to see movies that are being released on streaming platforms anyway. This whole ape stuff is stupid and people are losing money left and right from it. I‚Äôve gotten so many DM‚Äôs from apes most of you have small dicks so stop trying seriously.

I ended up purchasing AMC at 8$ a stock and spent $1000. 

Turns out the purchase was denied because I put the wrong account/routing number in. Fidelity still purchased the stocks as ‚Äúgood faith‚Äù

Woke up the following morning and the stock went way down - not knowing I decided to just not put my account info in correctly, but fidelity had already purchased the stocks...I figured I wouldn‚Äôt have to pay them back and the stock game just wasn‚Äôt for me. Fidelity notified me they would be selling the stocks if I didn‚Äôt pay in a week or so. They sold them.

Months later I‚Äôm receiving letters from debt collectors telling me I owe them that money yada yada 

Do I really have to pay them the balance or is this going to haunt me? 

Will it go into collections? Will it go on my credit report? 

Any help would be much appreciated.",nl3akf,New to stocks - did I make a huge mistake?

          4. Commercial rents will rise and price Gamestop shops out of business.

          7. The new console generation wont help GME, cause customers will sell off their old consols like crazy. And even if Gamestop only pays $50 for them, nobody wants to buy an old PS4! 
          8. And last but not least, even if they can turn around and make 500 million profit a year, that still does NOT justify their valuation!!!!

7647,,2021-05-26 00:13:55,t3_nl3swt,,wallstreetbets,"The streaming industry is getting a lot of exposure
lately with all the news from Disney+ and HBO max.
Looking for a pure play in the streaming service
came across Curiosity Stream. Basically the platform
offers documentaries about science, history, politics,
etc... and they have over 3000+ titles in the platform.
The founder is John Hendricks, founder and former
chairman of Discovery.

After digging a little bit I was surprised to see that
despite having 13M subscribers total revenue for Q3
was only $8.9M, giving an ARPU of only $0.15 which
seems ridiculous for the amount of value you are
getting. It seems like a good amount of the subscriber
base comes from bundled packages at a heavy
discount. They are looking for exposure while growing
at all costs. Here are some key point:
‚Ä¢ The company has no debt and $180M cash in the
balance sheet.
‚Ä¢ The company went from 2M bundled subscriptions in
Q1 2019 to 13M in Q3 2020
¬∑ Over 60% gross margin
‚Ä¢ They project 10x growth by 2025 with $400M in
revenues

Giving the uncertainty of the current market
environment it seems pretty safe to buy something
that sells $1 a month subscriptions and is disrupting
an industry, targeting a more sophisticated customers
instead of the average becky who likes stranger things.
The last time John Hendricks created something
(Discovery) he turned a $5M investment into a
$32B company before stepping down and creating
CuriosityStream.
I believe we could see a jump to 19 dollars by the end of september.

Side note: John Hendricks has been buying shares this
month increasing his position by 21%.

If you're like me and get caught in it, you still won't sell even if it does recover some after crashing. You'll get anchored on what you ""had"" and feel like it's owed to you, so you'll keep waiting for it to go back up, but you'll just keep leaving more on the table as it keeps draining away.

The top can't be called...so the best advice I can offer is to have a tiered exit strategy, set some limit orders all along the way up and just walk away. Be content with sampling the curve and you'll come out ahead with far fewer regrets...the chances of calling the exact top and unloading everything at the perfect moment is the real ""meme"".",,

I did something similar my 1st time. Bought on margin. Then they sold it. I had to pay the money. It was only 500. I had TD deactivate margin buying for me. I also only keep a cash account, no credit, no loans. I can't pay over if I lose so I only play with what I *can* lose. So don't do margin buys, don't buy puts or calls until you even somewhat understand the process and what's really happening or you can be sunk. Even when you kinda understand, wait and learn more. 

Know the difference:

INVESTING: long term profit, buy and hold, secure, old wrinkle brain boomer style

TRADING: *BETTING* (wsBETS) on success with puts and calls (essentially loans you can pay of if your bet is bad), short term profit, buy the dip and sell the news, volatile and risky, smooth brain crayon eating ape style",,

I think this sub was really fun and poked fun at the market, lots of gain and loss porn, lots of good DD and joke DD but it was symbolic of reddit. Then GME came in and more good DD and joke DD as well as genuine investors and counter investors

GME goes brrr in january, influx of newer people who don‚Äôt understand the lingo and compared the sub to a ‚Äúfraternity‚Äù, tried to slander it as racist and misogynistic for the ‚Äúape lingo‚Äù. 

Then new Mods were put in, and they hammered on all of the guidelines, enforced extensively and unnecessarily in some cases and lots of ban crazy episodes. 

All of that from the new influx of people after the GME jump so I get it, but it was the MSM that pointed all the hands here and painted this sub how it is. Deep down the fundamentals of fun and humor are still lurking tho",,

She set up the account put all her info in and we honestly thought we owned the stocks until they told us the routing number was incorrect, but they would buy the stocks regardless in ‚Äúgood faith‚Äù 

I came to the conclusion going halfsies on stocks was a terrible idea.

After hearing the nightly AMC report for the third night in a row I decided to call it a day. Either buy and sell the stocks or forget about it...I just didn‚Äôt do enough research to realize it would affect her credit or be hounded by fidelity for 1k.

But to answer your point, cargo cults were borne out of allied occupation of small pacific islands during the Second World War. The indigenous peoples, particularly of Micronesia and Papua New Guinea, previously had only infrequent contact with the outside world. Now they had large groups of of people from a society that was (technologically speaking) thousands of years ahead of them and sharing wealth (referred to by them as ""cargo"") which seemed mundane to the GIs but was incomprehensibly luxurious to the islanders. 

After the war ended the GIs went home and the peoples of these islands were effectively left to fend for themselves. But the collective memory of the foreigners who showed up and showered them with riches beyond their wildest fantasies remained. They didn't *really* understand the broader context of what had happened, but they knew what they had seen.

So a new religion emerged. They fashioned ""uniforms"" from cast off clothing. Maintained abandoned airstrips, going so far as to make ""headsets"" out of coconut shells so they could sit in the control towers and direct imaginary air traffic. They marched and paraded around as they had seen the soldiers do. Why? Because although they didn't know what these actions and objects *meant* they knew they were associated with that the cultists *truly* wanted - for the GIs to return and bring all the cargo back with them.

They even have a name to their erstwhile hero: ""John Frum"". It's unlikely that Frum was ever a real person, although several islands claim to be in possession of his grave. It's possible that the name stems from a misinterpretation of a random GI attempting to introduce himself (Hi, I'm John from Cincinnati). Cargo cultists believe that if they perform the right actions with the right ceremonial accouterments then John Frum will return and with him he will bring rewards for his followers in the form of cargo (or, wealth).

Over time the rituals they performed and their expectations of the reward they would receive grew and became increasingly outlandish. Modern cargo cultists can be seen wearing truly impressive ""uniforms"" and engaging in incredibly intricate drills/exercises as nothing has, to date, caused Frum to arrive with the sought after wealth. 

This is the memestonk cultists to a T. They idolize DFV in the same way Frum is venerated. They obsessively do things they don't truly understand in the hopes that it will cause them to be rewarded with an unrealistic prize -with the added bonus that they hope to see their ""enemies"" destroyed when the end-times come. 

u/GasolinePizza is correct that they *also* exhibit many (if not all) of the indicators of a classical cult,  including hostility to non-members, discouraging critical thinking about their belief system, and a gradual subsumation of their individual identities. But I'm already going to trigger Chad Dickens so I'll let him explain that one to you. ^(and sorry to everyone else for cluttering your feed)",,

Rothschilds bow to Bogdanoffs.
In contact with aliens.
Possess psychic-like abilities.
Control France with an iron but fair fist.
Own castles & banks globally.
Will bankroll the first cities on Mars (Bogdangrad will be be the first city).
Direct descendants of the ancient royal blood lines.
Can save entire continents with a single phone call.
Own 99% of DNA editing research facilities on Earth.
First designer babies will in all likelihood be Bogdanoff babies.
Both brothers said to have 215+ IQ, such intelligence on Earth has only existed deep in Tibetan monasteries & Area 51.
Ancient Indian scriptures tell of two angels who will descend upon Earth and will bring an era of enlightenment and unprecedented technological progress with them.
The Tunguska event in 1908 was actually the Bogdanoff's arriving on planet Earth. How else do you think they got their Slavic last names and how else do you explain the exponential acceleration in technological and scientific development since then?
They own Nanobot R&D labs around the world.
You likely have Bogdabots inside you right now.
The Bogdanoffs are in regular communication with the Archangels Michael and Gabriel, forwarding the word of God to the Orthodox Church. Who do you think set up the meeting between the pope & the Orthodox high command (First meeting between the two organisations in over 1000 years) and arranged the Orthodox leader‚Äôs first trip to Antarctica in history literally a few days later to the Bogdanoff bunker in Wilkes land?
They learned fluent French in under a week.
Invented post-anabelian froeboid geometrics, a complex field of mathematics which only they can comprehend fully.
Nation states entrust their gold reserves with the twins. There‚Äôs no gold in Ft. Knox, only Ft. Bogdanoff.
All major philosophers and scientists have made reference to them in one way or another.
The twins are about 7 decades old, from the space-time reference point of the base human currently accepted by our society.
In reality, they are timeless beings existing in all points of time and space from the big bang to the end of the universe. We don‚Äôt know their ultimate plans yet. We hope they‚Äôre benevolent beings.Ôªø",,

Now they are trying to be an enterprise video tool...which seems like an okay business. But I‚Äôm not sold on it, the justification for their valuation seems to be some vague tools/products they will be introducing this year. The only one they really elaborated on was a form of DAM, which I don‚Äôt see being a very lucrative business. Livestream was a smart acquisition, but where are the results?

Mods are not deleted, they got removed and readded because reddit does not give us functionality to move admins around. **This has been said many, many times.**

The only threads that get stickied are megathreads, weekly earnings, rules threads, and the occasional joke thread.

>  I remember one of the new mods 'wsbincinerator' who was then removed quickly

Literally just someone's alt. According to the modlog they had no mod actions. Your point?

> This sub gained 8mil + members and the only content that get 10k+ likes is GME related.

Because all the people that came over, came over because of GME. I know. Mindblowing.

Also, meaningful discussion will ALWAYS get lower engagement than funny memes or confirmation bias. That's how social media works.

> I'm not necessarily saying you have been bought off or that you're on anyones side, just seems something has happened, i don't know what.

Yes. 8 million people joined reddit and started acting like it was facebook. 

>  I just want my GME megathread 

The GME megathread causes silos and only made the division between GME diehards and GME haters. The subreddit normally goes through swings as it trades whatever is moving the most, but by separating people, many people never got to see what the subreddit actually is.",,
