I still think they are going to have a huge share buyback of over 14m shares (their buyback program was increased from 75m to 475m) in stock and add to the insider owned shares which is now at 54.80% over the week it has gone up about 2%. Which is a bullish signal. If 14m shares were bought that would leave about 51m shares to be traded publicly and the insider owned share percentage would go to about 62% which would be a large driving factor in the price going up due to scarcity. Also the buyback would be large enough to trigger a massive buy and I would jizz my pants.",nmnbfw,*UPDATE* Why I still Think EXPI Is Going To $60 In 4-6 Weeks (up 10.59% this week)

So, [after a brief case of violent diarrhea from Oklahoma Grocery Store sushi](https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/lrslbb/psa_do_not_eat_grocery_store_sushi_right_now/), he was ready to hatch his plan!

His plans for this move could‚Äôve been anyone‚Äôs guess. One possibility he inquired about was [how to be a Tea Blendmaster.](https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/lfga0m/how_does_one_become_a_blendmaster/) [Another was him possibly reconnecting with God.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/lsij6j/agnostic_jew_seeking_faith_in_god/) Yet, he seemed to be asking questions about another topic more often than the others...

[Bees.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lxcnt1/c%C3%B3mo_es_la_legalidad_de_la_apicultura_informal/)

Specifically, beekeeping, a topic he admitted he had no experience in, [as evident from him looking for any book on the subject as an introduction months before.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/)

What he planned on doing with the bees was anyone‚Äôs guess, and I doubt he thought it through that much either. One post **AFTER** he took possession of 200,000 bees (we‚Äôll get to that later,) was [asking Americans if there was a demand for mead in the states.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/) So, was he thinking of importing Uruguayan honey to the US to be made into mead?

Indeed, he had no idea even what a bee was until he stumbled his way through a book, and then decided to YOLO into honey in Uruguay. He somehow got in touch with an ecology professor in Montevideo that would help him set things up in exchange for grad students fucking with them every now and again. Oh, and the bees were from fucking Myanmar. Handshake agreement, of course. Total Chad move.

And like I said before, the rest went without incident for a while. It would take the bees ‚Äúa year‚Äù to make honey, so he just kinda hung out, stayed busy, and tried to find part time work in a foreign country he arrived in 2.5 months earlier.

And then, the professor ghosted him. Just disappeared. Shortly thereafter, government agents come out about this kid from Oklahoma illegally importing a non-native bee to their country. Apparently his bees had been fucking with other apiaries. So, he did probably the smartest thing he‚Äôs ever done.

He ran.

He fucking ran from the Uruguayan government, took a plane to LAX, and arrived with $14 to his name. His friend sent him $100, which wasn‚Äôt enough to go back to Oklahoma, so he took a $75 flight to Seattle, where he is also not from.

His last post is from a train out of the airport, with $39 to his name. I don‚Äôt know what is in store for him, but I know that $39 is as good as spent on urchin futures or whatever market he‚Äôs going to crash up there.

575,,2021-05-28 03:12:37,t3_nmofz4,,wallstreetbets,"This started as a comment reply but I thought maybe people would like reading it. I've been researching Palantir since literally late November 2020 and I have nearly my entire portfolio in LEAPS expiring January 2023. So I have continually done more research on them this is just the basics to clear up confusion and help people who don't understand it because it's hard to hear all the hype and stuff. Also AMC to the moon tomorrow for my FDs I bought!! Don't judge me it's just fun to be in on the action on weeks like this.


So you should think of palantir as basically three companies and they actually are very far from unprofitable. 

They developed the really massive government software (gotham) specifically as a result of an interaction that happened to Peter Thiel while he was at paypal. They were losing millions to foreign scammers at paypal and the solution ended up being a high quality algorithm that flagged the most likely scam transactions and then allowed analysts to efficiently double check and verify the real scam transactions.

 It essentially was using what computers are efficient at (sorting through massive amounts of data) and then combining that with what humans are good at (looking at the more complex nuances that at least at that point computer algorithms were incapable of doing) and augmenting the humans ability to make complex decisions by rapidly sorting through the incoming data and bringing everything good to their attention.

They fixed paypals using this method and literally made the company profitable overnight because of fixing how much they were losing in the scam transactions. The FBI contacted PayPal and Thiel about using that initial software. That was literally his inspiration for what would become Palantir. He goes over it in huge detail in his book zero to one. If you make an audible account you can read it for free and find the chapter I'm talking about.

Then for 15 years they perfected the government software into the absolute nearly monopoly it is now in government intelligence augmentation software. The whole time though they reinvested almost everything for the last 10 years into building the commercial software (Foundry). That side of the business has only been live for a VERY short time and initially they literally didn't spend a single dollar on marketing their first commercial clients sought THEM out because of their insane reputation with the government. Foundry helps with supply chains and all kinds of other important data  insights. But if you want a recent example the NIH and the NHS both used Foundry to figure out how to best distribute the vaccine and vaccine distribution in the US and Britain has far outpaced expectations. You think commercial companies aren't going to be interested in using the software that was literally proven on a level like that?

 They're only just now adding huge amounts of people to their sales teams literally in the last six months which if you read Peter thiels book is insane for the stock because they have this crazy long term plan and he literally talks about how when they get to a certain point and start adding sales as a full sector of the company it means that is the company the company plans to BEGIN scaling. Meaning they're this big and they literally only just started on the scaling part. Which they've also said in tons of interviews if you're a die hard Palantirian like me. 



They actually also have the third side of the  business which is their actual like full AI for weaponization and war and defense for the government. Gotham is like helping analysts and commanders lead and even helping police or agents figure out what's going on. This other software is different. It's called Apollo and its only at the beginning too. It's like pure AI machine learning AI handles everything stuff. Go find a video called pentagon head of NSC briefs public on AI I think it's on the PBS channel on YouTube or some shit. Or you can listen to Joe Biden talk about how we're going to double our percentage of gdp spending on AI. The amount of government money that's going to go into AI as a weapon to compete with China DWARFS peoples expectations of how much large the market for the kind of software palantir makes is. 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201001005334/en/U.S.-Army-Research-Lab-Selects-Palantir-Technologies-Inc.-for-91M-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-Development

This is literally the backbone of everything AI that the government is about to invest in. Sure they're going to experiment with other research but if you do research you'll also find Palantir is the ONLY company that does anything remotely like this software that has anywhere near the kind of clearances like what is required for these contracts. They are currently a clearance level 5 and about to be the highest 6. The closest competitors are almost all a 3 or lower I'm not even sure if there's more than a single 4 and that stuff is crazy hard to get. 

But like again I'm an obsessive. I realize why people get so excited about the commercial side scaling and how it's very possible and can make them huge and it will. But I'm actually pretty sure the reason people like Cathy Wood has such a huge boner for them is that she realizes how MASSIVELY. And I mean MASSIVELY underestimated the amount of government revenue they will get from all this AI investing the United States and NATO are about to do. It's literally the next Manhattan project and they're absolutely going to be one of the biggest players developing it if not the biggest. I think it's funny because most people are pretty disinterested in the government stuff for Palantir but i really think the weaponized AI apollo stuff may be as big as anything could ever be. 




Also people got the insider selling stuff very very wrong. Tom Nash (love him or hate him I don't care) has a few really good recent videos where he explains it in basically full detail what was happening. The selling panicked a lot of retail investors during a time when the buying for growth markets had really slowed because of rate hike due to inflation scares and a ton of retail holders got scared and caused more selling and more people got scared because of that and sold and it really just was mass psychology in effect and a LOT of FUD and confusion. 

Basically a few executives karp in particular got billions of dollars worth of options that vest but literally expire so you have to exercise them which means you buy shares of the company at a strike price. Well because it's the company granting shares the strike price is literally 10 cents or something and these automatically have to vest at quarterly increments. So everytime karp was exercising he's actually buying shares. Like over 150 million in total maybe a lot more million SHARES not dollars. shares. And even those when he exercising he's buying shares technically from the company it ALL counts as profit on taxes and ITS NOT LONG TERM CAP GAINS ELIGIBLE. So over the last year plus this year he's essentially getting shares but the literal dollar value of those shares to the government counts as pure profit. So his total income which he's getting taxed at 40% of is in the BILLIONS yes billions. Because that's a lot to handle people that work for them actually automatically schedule sells of shares to cover the taxes so that there's no issue it's not even like him saying sell today and they do this.... TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INSIDER SELLING TO THE SEC. That's why it's automatically happening so no one can ever claim he's timing it. 

So listen cause here's where it gets important. The exercising of the shares counts as almost pure profits but remember he's receiving SHARES not dollars he doesn't actually get billions of dollars. So has to then sell SOME of the shares so he can pays taxes on that. Then when he sells the shares to pay the taxes for exercising he actually owes even more money if they went up from when he exercised. So everytime he's selling low its actually good for him because it's less ADDITIONAL PROFIT that he would owe taxes on.

 If he wasn't selling its because he thought it would go down even further and then he would actually owe less taxes overall. So if he thought it was going to tank he'd wait and actually get a nice fat discount on his taxes. 

I know this seems really crazy but I promise that's how it works you can look it up in detail but yeah shocking that mainstream media and redditors/youtubers who barely do research and have no real understanding of how these billion dollar compensations work would get it wrong. Unbelievable I know. If he had actually sold the massive overall percentage of his shares that some people claim he did the company would be at like $3-6 dollars not low 20s. Retail got confused because of market pressured due to interest rate fears from inflation and sold low (like retail always does) to institutions.",nmofz4,"Palantir DD if you want to understand company and it's history better (also insider ""selling"" explained in detail)"

What is Blue Apron?


Blue Apron (NYSE: APRN) was the forgotten step child, bad luck Brian, IPO of summer 2017 that priced below range and had the misfortune of debuting after Amazon bought Whole Foods. Since it‚Äôs debut, the stock has suffered dropping from nearly $150 per share (adjusted for a 2019 reverse-split necessitated to stay listed) to as low as approximately $2.00!


Why the Drop?


Management. Fucking. Sucked. The prior executive team essentially handed Chad Hello Fresh the keys to the kingdom, when they made the fatal error of betting that the ‚Äúhigh affinity core users‚Äù would be enough to sustain the business. For this reason, they cut marketing to nearly nothing and attempted to realize operating leverage by shrinking the customer base only to its most prolific buyers.

This was stupid. HelloFresh did the opposite, essentially giving away meals, and they used it to stockpile market share. Put a chart up of HelloFresh customers against Blue Apron. You‚Äôll see the two lines converge and a clear indication that HelloFresh stole most of their business. HelloFresh was one of the best trades of the past 5 years. Look at the chart, look at the sales, and look at the margins. They have managed to achieve operating leverage by employing affordable pricing and emphasizing retention.


Blue Apron Might Go Under....


Today the company is in a dire place. Languishing away in Micro Cap hell at an $80M market cap, no one on Wall Street wants to cover these guys. Only their bankers, CG and MS, write them research and neither are overly optimistic. They‚Äôre in a shit spot with a credit line that mandates they keep $15M cash at all times, and they keep their customer base above 300K (thus far, they‚Äôve struggled). They‚Äôre sitting on $29M and burn enough cash per Q that they might go below that $15M level (wouldn‚Äôt be a first). All signs are negative...


But I Think They Might Win


Blue Apron is under new management. Linda Kozlowski, is the former COO of ETSY and an ex-strategist at Alibaba. She believes HelloFresh did things right and she wants to right the ship. Her ballsy-ass plan is to ride the line on cash and go all in on customer growth. She realizes those customers are worth a lot more than income on the P&L, and that she needs to make the pot as big as she can. Thus far, it‚Äôs worked. Customers are up over 20% in the past two periods and retention rates are rising. We are seeing signs of operating leverage, and it opens a big possibility.


My Prediction

Management is buying shares. They know the company is not healthy. The only logic is that they have a plan that‚Äôs working. You can‚Äôt sell a dying business with a shrinking share, but you can certainly sell a growing community, that could be an accretive asset to a better capitalized entity. I think Linda is going either get the business in a position where it can refinance for better terms, or where it can be sold to create shareholder value via a strategic alternative.

Everyone is talking about how the squeeze didn't even happen and the shorts didn't cover yet. What I don't understand is why wouldn't that be possible? If short interest is 17%, so let's round up to about 100M shares. Today the volume traded was 700M shares. Couldn't 100M of those 700M have been the shorts covering? And if they didn't cover, today alone 700M shares were traded, why would 100M shares bought by shorts cause a squeeze if today 700M were traded?

I have been having this question for awhile, since I noticed the same with GME. In the days preceding January 28th (when GME reached its peak), the combined volume was several times the amount of float. How come the squeeze happened and why did it happen? If the volume was so high, couldn't the shorts have covered in the days preceding that?

I hope this makes sense and I really hope someone will be kind enough to explain a fellow retard who only knows about crayons what this all means.

Everything looked to have gone off successfully. We are now waiting on the data and craft to be analysed and inspected. This will take a few weeks according to Michael Colglazier.
That being said he had already outlined the test schedule in the earnings zoom call.

1st test flight - may 
2nd crewed flight - June 
3rd flight with R Branson on board late June/July 

4th flight this will be taking the Italian airforce on a training mission (600k a seat) late July


On the run in to the first test flight some possible maintenance issues appeared with the carrier plane White knight 2‚Ä¶. 
This indeed could have gone either way , after 2 weeks inspections it was decided that WK2 did not need to delay testing no maintenance was needed at this point. Scheduled Maintenance will commence in the fall after all tests have been completed.
Upon this news it is my opinion that the testing programme will go ahead as planned.

The market has responded accordingly and the stock is now up from $17-‚Ç¨31

598,,2021-05-28 09:17:32,t3_nmtt43,,wallstreetbets,"Trainline has taken a huge dip since the UK government's announcement of the plan to nationalise the railway network. The plan includes creating an online ticketing platform by Great British Railways which might have a huge blow on Trainline revenue. However, this platform does not yet exist and will probably take a couple of years to develop. Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed.

In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales.  Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%.

I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time  for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

603,,2021-05-28 10:41:01,t3_nmuzzi,,wallstreetbets,"Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent of Modernas if not more. Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects) 

Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

Imagine if the spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize one piece to understand the whole picture it and helps modify your DNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates it can still recognize the virus. In contrast to using one portion of the picture as it mutates it's easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine, that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. Not only that but they have had the least amount of side effects of any covid vaccine deeming it the safest covid vaccine.... 

And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein (whole picture) and the safety profile. Also worth a mention is that you could store it in a regular refrigerator, and let it sit out in room temperature while you're vaccinating people instead of a special ultra low temp freeze needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers, this is a majority of the world. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines so other protein competitors will be far behind and they will have an a moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing they teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine. They will be combining flu and covid vaccine by 2025 for possibly double the price of current covid vaccine.

 They are pretty much de-risked at this point. Yes you could buy other  biotechs that can go up 20x but are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up) that has all successful trials done so far, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment to where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place there are no more glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""

They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. Yesterday at market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. 
 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

Future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract in there ( in the link below in another message). It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 

As far as my position I own some $200 July calls along with about 933 shares. I'm all in baby.  Been in since $4.06, I panicked and sold once during February a couple months during the mini bear market we had and got back in a bit too early so got a wash sale üôà but I'm diamond hands all the way to $800 from here.  LFG I expect to turn that into a cool million in a year's time via shares and options based on the DD provided. Just know this isn't all completely my DD some of this is taken from my good friends at the community Nvax community on Stocktwits. They're one of the most hardcore groups that provides excellent DD and are always willing to help each other a hand if anyone's got questions highly recommend to check it out. So my point is this is information collected over the months that is a group consensus on nvax future price. (Check out next link below this paragraph, it has My positions and an amazing DD chart converting contracts to future price and comparing with competitors. My screen name on stovktwits  is the same on there Johnnyknowsbest. Been on there and here since i started with nvax.

Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. This is huge as the combo is going to differentiate them especially since both flu and covid vaccines are first in class.

1) We look to the PTON CFO's statement found in the latest earnings call transcript, for guidance:
""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior.""
2) Being that we do not have access to a 10-K filing for Q4 fiscal '19, we will access other filings that do in fact reference numbers from fiscal '19...
A) 10-K filing dated 9/11/2020
B) 10-Q filing dated 5/6/2020
3) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $223.3M under Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19)
But, that is TOTAL Revenue; we need to find out what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike sales...
4) To calculate what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike Sales, we can use numbers from neighboring Q3 (i.e. Three Months Ended March 31, 2019)...
A) On page 6 of the 10-Q, you will find Revenue of ""Connected Fitness Products"" (aka Bike Sales) to be $261.6M
B) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $316.7M
C) % of Bike Sales per TOTAL Revenue: $261.6M / $316.7M * 100 = 82.6% {""Connected Fitness Products"" Revenue (aka Bike Sales)}
5) Apply 82.6% to the TOTAL Revenue $223.3M for Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19): $223.3M x 0.826 = $184.45M {Bike Sales for Q4 of fiscal '19}
6) Per the CFO, ""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior."":

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote... By mid-July, we‚Äôll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase precious metals  especially silver amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative 

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

Gold rose over 60% in the 1930s as the prices of stocks and real estate crashed. You could buy an entire block with a one ounce gold coin. Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms.

I must address Cramer's statement because he is obviously trying to add fuel to the short-selling fire: When he says ""we're not going natural gas"" he is clearly making a vague and general statement meant to be interpreted in the worst possible way: ""no one is going to buy or use natural gas."" By now, I hope everyone that is interested in this stock understands that CLNE offers an alternative transportation fuel, thus, the investments made by BP and Chevron, and not revolutionary technology like some EV's (but this is mostly hype meant to catapult EVs to the front. What most people do not realize is that driverless technology and such can be placed in Petro vehicles too). Also, unfortunately, the company has done a terrible marketting job. That's why powerful analysts can get away with making vague and unsupported statements. The fact that Cramer explained the stock's decrease over the last month as being due to widespread dissaproval is misleading, at best. Many people do not yet know about the cleanliness and therapeutic effects RNG has on the climate.

The News...

If you haven't read yet it looks like Federal Cannabis legalization my be around the corner. [Here](https://www.mpp.org/policy/federal/the-more-act/) is the House Bill. Supporters seem on board and like the reforms they have done to the bill including rescheduling cannabis. [Last time](https://mjbizdaily.com/key-us-house-lawmaker-reintroduces-federal-marijuana-legalization-bill/) the bill was introduced it cleared the House.   


Personally I think this gets a lot of support especially from a fiscal point of view. With stimulus stalling and a giant debate going on about how to pay for the stimulus I think cannabis offers the easiest way to collect federal revenue. A simple review of the bill and the fiscal benefits to the Fed's can be read [here](https://www.justtherealnews.com/congress/nadler-blumenauer-lee-jackson-lee-jeffries-velazquez-reintroduce-comprehensive-marijuana-reform-legislation/). The bill states a 5% fed tax. Money coming for uncle Sam, right when questions about paying for stimulus.... Personally I think it adds up, but that's for you to decide. 

Okay so that's the hype...

Let's talk about the tickers listed ($SNDL and $TLRY). 

$SNDL

I'll start with the cheaper YOLO, $SNDL. $SNDL short interest isn't high, but the company did issue convertible notes a while back around .7c if my memory is correct. I'm not saying they won't do it again, but they should be in a good place fiscally for now. Float is high with about 1.6B shares out there. However today's volume at the time of writing is over 415M. That's not bad given such a high float. It's about 200% more than the average volume. 

The options chain on $SNDL has me giddy. With over 200,000 options currently in the money on todays move above $1 there is some high potential here for some interesting action. The put to call ratio is just obnoxiously low at .08 it's screaming upwards betting. If we hold above $1 the potential squeeze up could be amazing.   


It's also broken up on the trend lines and out of the downward channel it was in. The regression channel from the peak squeeze back in Feb just broke out today according to my crayons I have laying around. 

$TLRY

$TLRY was the squeeze of a lifetime if you remember it back in 19'. The ticker was just a money printer with it's low float and stupid hype. Then they proceeded to do, like they all do, and issue debt. Shares tumbled since then falling from $120 --> $5. Ouch bag holders.   


Like all the cannabis stocks the Feb bump pushed $TLRY to above $60 in an amazing move. $TLRY has a lower short interest than $SNDL, but it also has a much lower float at about 300M. Compared to $SNDL the volume here isn't as good, but still remains decently above the avg volume around 36M as of right now. 

If we peep the options chain we also see a crazy low P/C ratio around .11. But we don't have the Open Interest in the chain like $SNDL does unless you roll out to Jun 18. Then we finally get some decent OI.   


Personally I am going with $SNDL. The option's chain looks better, the stock is cheaper, and the short interest is a little better. My advice would be to roll out till at least the Jun 11th $1 strike to not get eaten alive by Theta and IV crush. But WSB does what WSB wants and that's why I love you all.   
Do not go above the $2 strikes IMO. You will get crushed by theta unless we get an insane move, which could happen but I don't see the risk / reward there.",nn326f,MORE ACT / CANNABIS / $SNDL & $TLRY Potential

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday

>Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers‚Äô attempt to corner the market on the metal.

-
>Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926‚Äì2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers‚Äô Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.

-
>By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged‚ÄîMarch 27‚Äîsilver fell to $10.80, the metal‚Äôs biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, ‚ÄúA billion dollars isn‚Äôt what it used to be,‚Äù the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.

-
>To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978‚Äì91) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities.",nn36fw,There is no silver short squeeze happening.

* Partnerships with Foxconn and Magna Steyr, both giants in their respective industries, among others
* Large Fleet market in Europe gaining momentum, and 700+ Fisker reservations in this market alone
* 16,000+ reservations already. More than Tesla had 18 months pre-production
* Revenue streams include leasing automotives, servicing, selling emissions credits, selling insurance (like selling the pickaxe to miners, and selling the diamonds to the mine owners too, absolutely genius - Fisker are insuring cars which they own, because the customer is only leasing it)
* High short interest (20%+), high analyst price targets compared to current share price (100%+) and low valuation compared to peers ($3bn market cap currently)
* Designing the first ever all-electric popemobile - Massive, soon to be historic, event!
* I give $FSR (currently $13 a share) a price target of $100 by end of year 2022, if not sooner
* Price Targets: $35 by end of year - Previous ATH. $50 start of next year - European and Chinese debut of prototypes. $100 end of 2022 - start of production (SOP). $150+ 2023
* 2025 Price Targets, calculated using projected data: Bear case - $97 a share, Bull case - $519 a share
* Downside in the short term is capped by the large amount of cash on hand - one third of market cap is cash. Long term, is capped by risk factors, which are almost eligible and affect every automotive startup anyway.

## Fisker Automotive

In 2008, Fisker Automotive raised over $90 million from investors including venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. In September 2009, Fisker Automotive was awarded a $528 million loan guarantee by the United States Department of Energy (DOE). The automaker was one of four recipients of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, to encourage the domestic manufacture of electric cars. The funds were to be used to develop the Karma, as well as an affordable family-size plug-in hybrid car. The loan facility was frozen at $192 million in February 2012, after the DOE claimed that Fisker missed its milestones

In December 2011, just as the Fisker Karma was launched, its battery supplier, A123 Systems, recalled all batteries, followed by a second recall in 2012. A123 filed for bankruptcy in October 2012, leaving Fisker Automotive without a battery supplier. After selling approximately 2,000 units, production of the Fisker Karma was suspended in November 2012, in the absence of its battery supplier.

Henrik Fisker resigned as chairman from Fisker Automotive in March 2013, because of disagreements with management about business strategy. Later that year, the company declared voluntary bankruptcy.Fisker raised and spent more than a billion dollars over its lifetime.The heart of Fisker‚Äôs business model was in that early deal with Quantum. The idea was to design a gorgeous car, and have suppliers like Quantum provide the technology because off-the-shelf parts from suppliers would help keep costs down.

But there were problems with this strategy: Sometimes, those parts had to be custom-made to fit the design vision, which resulted in higher prices for Fisker. Other times, parts were delivered late or, worse, faulty, but Fisker was locked in to those supplier relationships. Sources close to Fisker have also said that many of the parts were owned by the suppliers themselves, so Fisker didn‚Äôt own a lot of the internal technology.

The broker that raised funds for Fisker automotive, by selling their private shares, was Advanced Equities.It wasn‚Äôt until December 2011 and into 2012 that the more dubious efforts of Advanced Equities became clearer to Fisker‚Äôs hundreds of investors. The last few hundred million dollars of Advanced Equities‚Äô fund raising for Fisker, starting with the D-1 round, was what brokers call ‚Äúpay to play.‚Äù As Fisker was running into technical, delivery and political problems, its valuation was quickly declining. But the company still needed more money, so the brokers went back to its current investors and said: Unless you give this more, your current shares will be diluted and your preferred stock will be converted to common stock.

It was essentially a gun to their heads. This is why investor Wray sued Fisker in February 2012, alleging he was on the receiving end of this tactic. In his lawsuit, he says Advanced Equities sent him a letter dated Jan. 18, 2012, stating that he needed to decide if he wanted to invest in Fisker‚Äôs next round, and pay around $84,000 by Jan. 27, 2012 ‚Äî a little over a week from receiving the letter. He also says that Advanced Equities assured him that he would have anti-dilution protection. According to the audio clip from Advanced Equities‚Äô internal sales call in early 2010, Advanced Equity leaders say that the Fisker deal will ‚Äúsuffer no dilution,‚Äù and was ‚Äúa dream scenario.‚Äù

That dream would soon end. In September 2012 after Fisker closed on $1.2 billion in funding, the bulk of it organized by Advanced Equities, the SEC charged the broker with misleading investors when it raised money for another company back in 2009 and 2010 (Bloom Energy). Advanced settled, agreeing to pay $1 million, and its co-founders were personally fined. Two months later Advanced Equities closed up shop.

Later, A123 Systems itself went bankrupt, causing more problems for Fisker. Fisker claimed that A123 Systems owed it $140 million, but a bankruptcy settlement reduced that to a paltry $15 million.

Then there was the just plain terrible luck for the ironically named Karma: Super Storm Sandy wiped out 338 of its Karmas in storage in New Jersey. The cars first drowned, and then caught on fire ‚Äî salt water damage caused a short circuit that was spread to other cars by high winds, Fisker said at the time.

With all of this happening in public ‚Äî and in a presidential election year ‚Äî Fisker‚Äôs struggles became highly politicized. The company was mentioned numerous times in presidential debates and speeches leading up to the election. Republican nominee Romney called Fisker and other DOE-supported companies losers.

The company didn‚Äôt seem to invest substantially in technology innovation or tech IP, and seemed to spend a disproportionate amount on suppliers. For example, numerous sources have said that the company paid upfront for 15,000 of some of the parts for its planned 15,000 Karmas. It ended up only selling around 2,000 of the cars. It has also been said that Fisker paid some funds upfront to have BMW make engines for the 100,000 Nina cars it hoped to produce ‚Äî in the end, Fisker didn‚Äôt deliver a single Nina.

Costs to build each Karma also creeped up because the company missed its volume targets, and because engineering had to change designs around supplier constraints. The company ended up adding $20,000 to its initial sale price.

Expensive hires may also have sucked away chunks of Fisker‚Äôs funding: Sources say that Fisker filled the upper levels of the company with seasoned auto executives from Detroit. At the high point of Fisker, the company had around 300 employees, plus dozens of contract staff. Bringing in a certain amount of the old guard could help a car startup ramp up quickly, and also impress potential investors with ‚Äúindustry names.‚Äù But those people are also used to big auto-industry budgets that included extensive travel and salaries ‚Äî that‚Äôs the opposite life of a tech startup.

## Fisker Inc.

In July 2016, Henrik Fisker expressed interest in designing a fully connected electric car with autonomous driving features and an aesthetically pleasing look. He has pursued battery technology, and hinted at potentially reviving the Fisker name with a pure-electric vehicle using technology that nobody else has. Since then Fisker has talked about delays to the promised solid state battery technology, which he does not expect to be able to be produced in volume until at least 2025. Posing risk for competition from more scientifically experienced future solid state battery producers such as Quantumscape.

***Forbes:*** ‚ÄúNow he‚Äôs back‚Äìand three things are different. First and foremost, he has a vital new partner: his wife, cofounder and Fisker Inc. CFO Geeta Gupta-Fisker. Second, his Los Angeles-based company is public this time around, raising more than $1 billion in an October 2020 IPO. And finally, Fisker‚Äôs stock price, up 56% since its debut, has made both Henrik and Geeta billionaires, each worth about $1.1 billion as of Friday‚Äôs market close. The auto industry has seen father-son and sibling leadership teams, but Fisker Inc.‚Äôs CEO-CFO combo is the fast-changing sector‚Äôs first husband and wife power couple.‚Äù

Wealth isn‚Äôt the purpose of the new company, Henrik says. ‚ÄúI never got into cars because of money. (This shows he is willing to do what is in the best interest of the company because he is not motivated by money, unlike 99% of other CEO‚Äôs)

The couple sought a big stake in the new venture to ensure they can control its fate in a way Fisker couldn‚Äôt with his earlier company.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yzhded6pfw171.png?width=408&format=png&auto=webp&s=54b30259720cf853a8efeacf058f2f74315260b9

Henrik is an auto industry celebrity, but Geeta‚Äôs background is equally impressive. A native of India, she holds multiple degrees in science, including a Ph.D. in biotechnology from Cambridge University where she was also a Research Newton Fellow. From there, she started a career in international investment for Lloyds Banking Group, and then managed investments for a high-net-worth client for several years. (In particular, this is insanely important - Geeta **KNOWS MONEY**! She knows how best to keep a company afloat, organize its share structure, provide value to shareholders, etc. because she has worked in the industry before. She may just be the most important element of Fisker Inc., due to the financial experience she has. At every step of the way, she is likely to make decisions with one sole focus - increasing share price and value).

She met her future husband in 2011 when he was visiting London, just before things started going very wrong at Fisker Automotive. They married in 2012.

‚ÄúWhen I left Fisker Automotive, all I had was my car,‚Äù Henrik remembers. ‚ÄúI'm in a different position, mainly because of Geeta. Because she cuts the deals.‚Äù

To get the new venture off the ground, the Fiskers invested the majority of their life savings‚Äìan enormous financial risk given the fate of Henrik‚Äôs prior company. Then, just as they were locking in plans for the IPO back in July, they were hit by a highly unwelcome complication: Geeta learned she had early-stage breast cancer.

‚ÄúShe got the call (from her doctor) during a call with investors,‚Äù Henrik says. Despite that bombshell, she continued working with banks and investors in the weeks that followed, even as she underwent two surgical procedures and radiation therapy. Her medical therapy concluded in November.

Henrik, who marvels at her fortitude throughout the health crisis says, ‚Äúshe only missed something like one day of work...That's just how she is. She works tirelessly.‚Äù

## Fisker Ocean

The Fisker Ocean will have a nearly 300-mile range with an 80 kWh battery and a solar panel roof as a range extender, adding approximately 1,000 free miles of range per year. Advanced electronics will be housed under the hood, and the vehicle will incorporate recycled and sustainable materials throughout. Deliveries of the Ocean are scheduled to begin in 2022.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s87j6bdsfw171.png?width=438&format=png&auto=webp&s=e40add9ce53319d31db242cce73a303afb03cbab

Fisker has also announced a partnership with Electrify America to ensure Fisker Ocean vehicles will integrate seamlessly with Electrify America charging stations when the e-SUV hits the market. With features such as a solar roof and recycled inner materials, it will be, according to Fisker Inc., the ""world's most sustainable vehicle.""

In 2017, Fisker Inc. announced that it had filed patents on flexible solid-state battery designs. Fisker expected the batteries to be produced on a mass scale around 2020. A prototype of the battery debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018. In October 2018, Fisker announced new funding for battery development through Caterpillar Venture Capital. The solid-state batteries are intended to deliver longer vehicle range and faster charging times.

In 2018, Fisker was named to the board of directors of First Cobalt, a North American cobalt refinery that produces battery materials.

In September 2019, it was announced that Fisker Inc. was partnering with Game of Thrones actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who will serve as a partner and sustainability adviser to Fisker, to work on advanced, affordable, electric mobility models.

&#x200B;

[In addition to being a well-known actor, Coster-Waldau is also the United Nations Development Program Goodwill Ambassador for climate change and other social issues.](https://preview.redd.it/3hssff5vfw171.png?width=451&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebe55e2468c5b63d1bc0ac3c71547219dff5afaa)

Nikolaj wrote this piece about Fisker:

To quote a friend of mine who is a lot smarter than me, architect Bjarke Ingels: ‚ÄúThe idea that sustainability needs to sacrifice quality of life is a flawed one. It‚Äôs a design challenge, a challenge to build something that transforms the idea of sustainability into something that will increase the quality of life for all those around it.‚Äù

One person meeting that challenge is Henrik Fisker, who has designed some of the most iconic cars over the past decades for BMW and others, like the BMW Z8, Aston Martin DB9 and Aston Martin V8 Vantage. He‚Äôs a hero for gas-guzzling supercars. He is a fellow Dane, I am a fan, and we met, of all places, on Twitter.

When we met in person, he described his new project ‚Äî an all-electric luxury SUV ‚Äî and asked me if I would help spread the word on his car. The problem as I see it with most electric cars is that they only accomplish the basics. They get you from point A to B. They run electric so you don‚Äôt pollute while driving, but that‚Äôs it. They are basically unattractive combustion engine cars that have a battery thrown into them ‚Äî and for most of them, a battery with a limited range. What Fisker does is to try to make every part of the car in a sustainable and attractive way, like a full-length solar roof, recycled floor mats and vegan leather seats. It looks incredibly cool and inviting, with a great 250- to 300-mile range, and at a cost of just under $40,000, it‚Äôs a luxury car affordable to a mass market.

I said yes and even became an investor, not only because it‚Äôs a great car but more importantly, I hope and believe it can inspire other companies to actively incorporate sustainability goals into all aspects of their business. Fisker then had the idea of calling me ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù adviser. Which I am not. Just to be clear. Thanks Henrik, sounds cool, but I am an actor and a citizen, and that‚Äôs really it.

And what about Hollywood? Is our industry changing, are we at the forefront? Looking at social media, you would think so. And things are happening, but usually only when a camera is pointed at people. Remember a few years back when all awards shows only used EVs for the red carpet? We made a difference. We mattered. We showed the way. So cool. So green, so ‚Ä¶ brief. Now it‚Äôs back to the Escalade. But hey, we are not using plastic straws anymore!

To believe that change will come from Hollywood is not really based in reality (when did that stop us?), but we are great at reacting ‚Äî and things around us are changing, and changing us. I have a good friend who loves his SUV. It‚Äôs not electric. But he cannot give up his car. He is a good guy, he‚Äôs works for the U.N., so if he has a problem going electric, we all do. But if he is presented with an alternative that doesn‚Äôt mean a reduction in his quality of life, something like the Fisker SUV, I think he‚Äôd transition to electric in a heartbeat.

The IPO deal values Fisker Inc at US$2.9 billion, with an IPO share price of $10.

On July 30, 2020, Fisker announced plans for a four-vehicle portfolio by 2025. The Fisker Ocean SUV will be joined by a sports sedan based on their previously announced Fisker Emotion concept, a coupe-like SUV, and a lifestyle pickup truck. All will be electric vehicles.

On October 15, 2020, Fisker Inc announced it would be outsourcing vehicle production of its Fisker Ocean electric SUV to Magna Steyr, to reduce the complexities and costs related to the building and operating its own factory. Magna will start building the Fisker Ocean in Europe in 2022.

## Henrik Fisker Interview quotes:

I have people on Twitter saying, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just make the car next month? You have a prototype.‚Äù Most people don‚Äôt understand that it takes 18 months to do long-lead body tooling for high-volume vehicles. Most people don‚Äôt understand it takes two years to do durability tests and do all the engineering certification and everything else.

And on the business model itself, I believe that there is nobody in the near future or the next couple of years that‚Äôs going to make a million EVs on one model. Today, there‚Äôs nobody doing it. Tesla probably has the highest volume of one single model, a couple hundred thousand. But even the big giant established carmakers are not making, right now, a couple hundred thousand vehicles of one model. So the way you get volume, in my view, is if you partner up with other OEMs and share some of the expensive parts of the platform, which in my view is not anymore something that is unique IP or something that is a unique experience to the customer. An aluminum stamped floor or a steel stamped floor really doesn‚Äôt have any brand value anymore.

And obviously, as we move forward, we always start to do some of the things ourselves. But it was really about de-risking in our first vehicle to market. So we‚Äôre going to do another three vehicles, which we can do because we don‚Äôt have to spend all our money and effort on learning how to manufacture a car, for instance.

So we have programmed a lot. We have hired a head of ESG, environmental and social governance, and he is really spearheading developing specific... we kind of put out some goals that we would like to reach with suppliers, and we at least try to bring them in that direction. They are not reaching those goals right now, but they may reach them later. And then we have goals for ourselves. So for instance, we look at transport. Are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs closer to the plant, or are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs on the other side of the planet that way we have to then transport all that stuff. So those are the types of things that we‚Äôre really thinking about now as we‚Äôre nominating suppliers. And finally, materials as well, looking at sustainable materials. We‚Äôve actually picked up a lot of knowledge on that side as well, where we are adding more sustainable materials to our vehicle. So we are actually looking across everything ‚Äî supply chain, where the suppliers are located, what the suppliers are doing for sustainability, and also then of course in the vehicle itself ‚Äî in terms of the type of materials there.

So - let's summarize - prices are rising at their fastest pace in almost 30 years and incomes just plunged by their most ever! We're gonna need more stimmies!""  

Plus  to above; 

Last year, Hirschman Capital noted that since 1821, 98% of sovereigns that hit 130% debt/GDP have defaulted on their sovereign debt.   

The US hit 130% late last year. 

Simple Conclussion : The Fed can‚Äôt go ‚Äúhawkish‚Äù and raise rates without sending markets ‚Äìand economies‚Äìto their knees; by extension, they now have nothing left to ‚Äúcut‚Äù when the current everything bubble implodes.

And that  is a *real problem*.

 There are only two ways for sovereigns to default: 

Inflation or collapse.    

The latter is not an option. 

 As for a solution, what‚Äôs so tragic is that the only option before the Fed is an even bigger problem‚Äîcurrent and inevitably more inflation. 

 That is, if the Fed wants to keep markets (and their job security) breathing, they no longer have the foregoing template of ‚Äúrate-hike-followed-by-rate-cutting‚Äù at their disposal, which means they now have no choice but to dovishly keep rates near the zero-bound indefinitely.

But the only way to keep rates ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù and nailed to the floor of time is to purchase otherwise unwanted bonds to keep their prices elevated and hence yields and rates repressed.

Such bond ‚Äúaccommodation,‚Äù of course, costs money, and as we already know, the only ‚Äúmoney‚Äù the Fed has to spend is the kind they create out of thin air‚Äì the very kind of money (and policy) which leads to the kind of inflation discussed above‚Äînamely, the brutal kind.

 As for that fake money, the evidence of the Fed‚Äôs desperate (and only) direction is now obvious, as the following M2 money supply makes equally clear. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v774ta55sw171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e73c839beb67a67eea9aed7de4ac61d86813840

 

Fed is so embarrassed by this ‚Äúprinting solution‚Äù that they‚Äôve stopped *weekly* reporting of M2 data, and frankly, since March, have even stopped *monthly* reporting of the same.

That, of course, is both telling as well as disgraceful‚Ä¶ The Fed literally has something to hide, and that never bodes well, does it?

&#x200B;

 The correlation to central bank balance sheet (i.e., money supply) expansion and rising markets is now beyond dispute. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sgizb6xcsw171.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=aad2fe681fe0c49ac20368aba77e86c118b22959

 In short‚Äîdo you see the correlation and pattern? Do you see how the Fed‚Äôs market sausage is made? More importantly, do you now see the Fed‚Äôs self-made conundrum? 

 

Given that the Fed bows to the markets not the people, which choice do you think they‚Äôll make?

In other words, expect more money printing and more yield curve control‚Äîand hence more money creation, more inflation, and by extension more fiat currency debasement.

 More money supply to keep rates monetized simply means more currency debasement and rising inflation.",nn51ou,"""Fed's ""Favorite"" #Inflation Indicator (PCE) Explodes At Fastest Rate Since 1992 As Incomes Crash By Record"""

\- Massive increase in unmarried people buying houses alone. This used to be somewhat unusual, now it's becoming very common.

\- Massive increase in unmarried men, in particular, buying houses alone. Traditionally, the female-to-male ratio of unmarried homebuyers was about 5 to 1. For the last 3 months, it's been closer to 50/50.

Source is my own closed real estate purchase transactions. Am a mortgage broker (btw this means cash purchases are ""invisible"" to me). It takes 3-6 months for [HMDA data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Mortgage_Disclosure_Act) to become accessible to journalists and academics, and thus ""visible"" to the general public (assuming journalists deem it worthy of commenting on), but I can see the trends live in real time.

How would one go about placing a bet that in about 3 or 6 months, the media, journalists, academics, etc, will pick up on this, publish articles, and potentially cause a lot of people to buy certain stocks. Which stocks would that be? Is there a ""Mancave, Inc"" out there that would potentially get an uptick? Or maybe a company making smart-home stuff that is particularly suited to renting by the room (the single men are not buying 1 bedroom condos, they are buying proper houses with 3 bedrooms, etc)?

EDIT: oh, and to be clear. It's not just an uptick in single men. It's an uptick in women too, but a massive surge from the men. It used to be that for 15 banana sales, 10 are to married couples, 4 to single women, and 1 to a single man. Now for the same 15 banana sales, it's 6 to married couples, 6 to single women, and 3 to single men, something like that.",nn76we,Homebuyer Demographics Shift towards single and male. How to bet?

NOK is making some hella moves, but granted maybe they‚Äôve catched on to us and they have call instead of puts for NOK and BB. Blackberry is higher than NOK but I think it deserves to be the other way around. 

For example, NOK just announced several agreements that allow them to expand overall networks in other countries, and if I‚Äôm understanding correctly it is contributing to expansion of infrastructure THATS HUGE. It‚Äôs undervalued - hella undervalued. 

BB is pure shitpost. The only news around it is that we‚Äôre talking about in Reddit.

What did everyone see three months ago with the initial squeeze?

AMC reached the peak of this little run yesterday. Sell now and lock in your money so you actually GAIN something instead of HOPING you will gain something.

Note this was the retard‚Äôs first option trade so he was going bananas seeing all the fucking ü§ë tendies. The retard was bullish and let the stock run until it got smack down. Instead of rolling the calls and taking a profit he was hopeful and waiting for the stock to bounce back up. After AMC dropped to 31 then to 26 he said fuck it let it run till then end hoping for one last minute run.

I still think they are going to have a huge share buyback of over 14m shares (their buyback program was increased from 75m to 475m) in stock and add to the insider owned shares which is now at 54.80% over the week it has gone up about 2%. Which is a bullish signal. If 14m shares were bought that would leave about 51m shares to be traded publicly and the insider owned share percentage would go to about 62% which would be a large driving factor in the price going up due to scarcity. Also the buyback would be large enough to trigger a massive buy and I would jizz my pants.",nmnbfw,*UPDATE* Why I still Think EXPI Is Going To $60 In 4-6 Weeks (up 10.59% this week)

[When we last left our hero,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrly28/the_legend_of_utheemperorofjenks_aka_ornamental/) he had just lost all of his rent money and what he could advance from credit cards on a failed Super Bowl bet, and a YOLO on ‚ÄúRhodium‚Äù that he ordered from a sketchy Slovakian Wish.com ripoff. Alas, it was, of course, fake, and he was broke and depressed. It might have been the first fatal case of autism. He thought to himself ‚ÄúAm I really that retarded?‚Äù Then, he realized ‚ÄúNo, it must be Oklahoma that‚Äôs retarded!‚Äù

So, [after a brief case of violent diarrhea from Oklahoma Grocery Store sushi](https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/lrslbb/psa_do_not_eat_grocery_store_sushi_right_now/), he was ready to hatch his plan! Uruguay! Yes, Uruguay. [He was going to move to Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lh5igx/c%C3%B3mo_se_puede_llegar_a_melo_desde_montevideo_sin/)

His plans for this move could‚Äôve been anyone‚Äôs guess. One possibility he inquired about was [how to be a Tea Blendmaster.](https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/lfga0m/how_does_one_become_a_blendmaster/) [Another was him possibly reconnecting with God.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/lsij6j/agnostic_jew_seeking_faith_in_god/) Yet, he seemed to be asking questions about another topic more often than the others...

[Bees.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lxcnt1/c%C3%B3mo_es_la_legalidad_de_la_apicultura_informal/)

Specifically, beekeeping, a topic he admitted he had no experience in, [as evident from him looking for any book on the subject as an introduction months before.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/)

What he planned on doing with the bees was anyone‚Äôs guess, and I doubt he thought it through that much either. One post **AFTER** he took possession of 200,000 bees (we‚Äôll get to that later,) was [asking Americans if there was a demand for mead in the states.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/) So, was he thinking of importing Uruguayan honey to the US to be made into mead? Was he going to make it himself? Did he move to another continent for no reason? Let‚Äôs all find out!

A little more than 2 months ago, he finally did it. [He moved to Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/m9ejpn/la_paloma/) And about a week after that, [he was driving a truck filled with 200k bees across his new country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/) Based on replies in that thread, he was aiming to have [a monopoly on beekeeping in the country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/gt48gke/)

[He picked up his hives without complication.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mtkkf3/about_to_upsize_my_apiary_whats_the_best_layout/) [And then he settled into Melo, Uruguay, and set up his apiary ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/n1jnte/my_humble_apiary_near_melo_uruguay/). Life was good.

But, trouble was afoot. According to a reply, [the species he was planning on keeping had literally never been kept by keepers in Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mtkkf3/about_to_upsize_my_apiary_whats_the_best_layout/gv0viej/) And then, disaster struck. [He went to TIFU to post his tale of spreading an invasive species in an industry he knew nothing about.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/nmd69k/tifu_by_importing_bees_to_uruguay/)

Indeed, he had no idea even what a bee was until he stumbled his way through a book, and then decided to YOLO into honey in Uruguay. He somehow got in touch with an ecology professor in Montevideo that would help him set things up in exchange for grad students fucking with them every now and again. Oh, and the bees were from fucking Myanmar. Handshake agreement, of course. Total Chad move.

And like I said before, the rest went without incident for a while. It would take the bees ‚Äúa year‚Äù to make honey, so he just kinda hung out, stayed busy, and tried to find part time work in a foreign country he arrived in 2.5 months earlier.

And then, the professor ghosted him. Just disappeared. Shortly thereafter, government agents come out about this kid from Oklahoma illegally importing a non-native bee to their country. Apparently his bees had been fucking with other apiaries. So, he did probably the smartest thing he‚Äôs ever done.

He ran.

He fucking ran from the Uruguayan government, took a plane to LAX, and arrived with $14 to his name. His friend sent him $100, which wasn‚Äôt enough to go back to Oklahoma, so he took a $75 flight to Seattle, where he is also not from.

His last post is from a train out of the airport, with $39 to his name. I don‚Äôt know what is in store for him, but I know that $39 is as good as spent on urchin futures or whatever market he‚Äôs going to crash up there.

854,,2021-05-28 03:12:37,t3_nmofz4,,wallstreetbets,"This started as a comment reply but I thought maybe people would like reading it. I've been researching Palantir since literally late November 2020 and I have nearly my entire portfolio in LEAPS expiring January 2023. So I have continually done more research on them this is just the basics to clear up confusion and help people who don't understand it because it's hard to hear all the hype and stuff. Also AMC to the moon tomorrow for my FDs I bought!! Don't judge me it's just fun to be in on the action on weeks like this.


So you should think of palantir as basically three companies and they actually are very far from unprofitable. 

They developed the really massive government software (gotham) specifically as a result of an interaction that happened to Peter Thiel while he was at paypal. They were losing millions to foreign scammers at paypal and the solution ended up being a high quality algorithm that flagged the most likely scam transactions and then allowed analysts to efficiently double check and verify the real scam transactions.

 It essentially was using what computers are efficient at (sorting through massive amounts of data) and then combining that with what humans are good at (looking at the more complex nuances that at least at that point computer algorithms were incapable of doing) and augmenting the humans ability to make complex decisions by rapidly sorting through the incoming data and bringing everything good to their attention.

They fixed paypals using this method and literally made the company profitable overnight because of fixing how much they were losing in the scam transactions. The FBI contacted PayPal and Thiel about using that initial software. That was literally his inspiration for what would become Palantir. He goes over it in huge detail in his book zero to one. If you make an audible account you can read it for free and find the chapter I'm talking about.

Then for 15 years they perfected the government software into the absolute nearly monopoly it is now in government intelligence augmentation software. The whole time though they reinvested almost everything for the last 10 years into building the commercial software (Foundry). That side of the business has only been live for a VERY short time and initially they literally didn't spend a single dollar on marketing their first commercial clients sought THEM out because of their insane reputation with the government. Foundry helps with supply chains and all kinds of other important data  insights. But if you want a recent example the NIH and the NHS both used Foundry to figure out how to best distribute the vaccine and vaccine distribution in the US and Britain has far outpaced expectations. You think commercial companies aren't going to be interested in using the software that was literally proven on a level like that?

 They're only just now adding huge amounts of people to their sales teams literally in the last six months which if you read Peter thiels book is insane for the stock because they have this crazy long term plan and he literally talks about how when they get to a certain point and start adding sales as a full sector of the company it means that is the company the company plans to BEGIN scaling. Meaning they're this big and they literally only just started on the scaling part. Which they've also said in tons of interviews if you're a die hard Palantirian like me. 



They actually also have the third side of the  business which is their actual like full AI for weaponization and war and defense for the government. Gotham is like helping analysts and commanders lead and even helping police or agents figure out what's going on. This other software is different. It's called Apollo and its only at the beginning too. It's like pure AI machine learning AI handles everything stuff. Go find a video called pentagon head of NSC briefs public on AI I think it's on the PBS channel on YouTube or some shit. Or you can listen to Joe Biden talk about how we're going to double our percentage of gdp spending on AI. The amount of government money that's going to go into AI as a weapon to compete with China DWARFS peoples expectations of how much large the market for the kind of software palantir makes is. 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201001005334/en/U.S.-Army-Research-Lab-Selects-Palantir-Technologies-Inc.-for-91M-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-Development

This is literally the backbone of everything AI that the government is about to invest in. Sure they're going to experiment with other research but if you do research you'll also find Palantir is the ONLY company that does anything remotely like this software that has anywhere near the kind of clearances like what is required for these contracts. They are currently a clearance level 5 and about to be the highest 6. The closest competitors are almost all a 3 or lower I'm not even sure if there's more than a single 4 and that stuff is crazy hard to get. 

But like again I'm an obsessive. I realize why people get so excited about the commercial side scaling and how it's very possible and can make them huge and it will. But I'm actually pretty sure the reason people like Cathy Wood has such a huge boner for them is that she realizes how MASSIVELY. And I mean MASSIVELY underestimated the amount of government revenue they will get from all this AI investing the United States and NATO are about to do. It's literally the next Manhattan project and they're absolutely going to be one of the biggest players developing it if not the biggest. I think it's funny because most people are pretty disinterested in the government stuff for Palantir but i really think the weaponized AI apollo stuff may be as big as anything could ever be. 




Also people got the insider selling stuff very very wrong. Tom Nash (love him or hate him I don't care) has a few really good recent videos where he explains it in basically full detail what was happening. The selling panicked a lot of retail investors during a time when the buying for growth markets had really slowed because of rate hike due to inflation scares and a ton of retail holders got scared and caused more selling and more people got scared because of that and sold and it really just was mass psychology in effect and a LOT of FUD and confusion. 

Basically a few executives karp in particular got billions of dollars worth of options that vest but literally expire so you have to exercise them which means you buy shares of the company at a strike price. Well because it's the company granting shares the strike price is literally 10 cents or something and these automatically have to vest at quarterly increments. So everytime karp was exercising he's actually buying shares. Like over 150 million in total maybe a lot more million SHARES not dollars. shares. And even those when he exercising he's buying shares technically from the company it ALL counts as profit on taxes and ITS NOT LONG TERM CAP GAINS ELIGIBLE. So over the last year plus this year he's essentially getting shares but the literal dollar value of those shares to the government counts as pure profit. So his total income which he's getting taxed at 40% of is in the BILLIONS yes billions. Because that's a lot to handle people that work for them actually automatically schedule sells of shares to cover the taxes so that there's no issue it's not even like him saying sell today and they do this.... TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INSIDER SELLING TO THE SEC. That's why it's automatically happening so no one can ever claim he's timing it. 

So listen cause here's where it gets important. The exercising of the shares counts as almost pure profits but remember he's receiving SHARES not dollars he doesn't actually get billions of dollars. So has to then sell SOME of the shares so he can pays taxes on that. Then when he sells the shares to pay the taxes for exercising he actually owes even more money if they went up from when he exercised. So everytime he's selling low its actually good for him because it's less ADDITIONAL PROFIT that he would owe taxes on.

 If he wasn't selling its because he thought it would go down even further and then he would actually owe less taxes overall. So if he thought it was going to tank he'd wait and actually get a nice fat discount on his taxes. 

I know this seems really crazy but I promise that's how it works you can look it up in detail but yeah shocking that mainstream media and redditors/youtubers who barely do research and have no real understanding of how these billion dollar compensations work would get it wrong. Unbelievable I know. If he had actually sold the massive overall percentage of his shares that some people claim he did the company would be at like $3-6 dollars not low 20s. Retail got confused because of market pressured due to interest rate fears from inflation and sold low (like retail always does) to institutions.",nmofz4,"Palantir DD if you want to understand company and it's history better (also insider ""selling"" explained in detail)"

What is Blue Apron?


Blue Apron (NYSE: APRN) was the forgotten step child, bad luck Brian, IPO of summer 2017 that priced below range and had the misfortune of debuting after Amazon bought Whole Foods. Since it‚Äôs debut, the stock has suffered dropping from nearly $150 per share (adjusted for a 2019 reverse-split necessitated to stay listed) to as low as approximately $2.00!


Why the Drop?


Management. Fucking. Sucked. The prior executive team essentially handed Chad Hello Fresh the keys to the kingdom, when they made the fatal error of betting that the ‚Äúhigh affinity core users‚Äù would be enough to sustain the business. For this reason, they cut marketing to nearly nothing and attempted to realize operating leverage by shrinking the customer base only to its most prolific buyers.

This was stupid. HelloFresh did the opposite, essentially giving away meals, and they used it to stockpile market share. Put a chart up of HelloFresh customers against Blue Apron. You‚Äôll see the two lines converge and a clear indication that HelloFresh stole most of their business. HelloFresh was one of the best trades of the past 5 years. Look at the chart, look at the sales, and look at the margins. They have managed to achieve operating leverage by employing affordable pricing and emphasizing retention.


Blue Apron Might Go Under....


Today the company is in a dire place. Languishing away in Micro Cap hell at an $80M market cap, no one on Wall Street wants to cover these guys. Only their bankers, CG and MS, write them research and neither are overly optimistic. They‚Äôre in a shit spot with a credit line that mandates they keep $15M cash at all times, and they keep their customer base above 300K (thus far, they‚Äôve struggled). They‚Äôre sitting on $29M and burn enough cash per Q that they might go below that $15M level (wouldn‚Äôt be a first). All signs are negative...


But I Think They Might Win


Blue Apron is under new management. Linda Kozlowski, is the former COO of ETSY and an ex-strategist at Alibaba. She believes HelloFresh did things right and she wants to right the ship. Her ballsy-ass plan is to ride the line on cash and go all in on customer growth. She realizes those customers are worth a lot more than income on the P&L, and that she needs to make the pot as big as she can. Thus far, it‚Äôs worked. Customers are up over 20% in the past two periods and retention rates are rising. We are seeing signs of operating leverage, and it opens a big possibility.


My Prediction

Management is buying shares. They know the company is not healthy. The only logic is that they have a plan that‚Äôs working. You can‚Äôt sell a dying business with a shrinking share, but you can certainly sell a growing community, that could be an accretive asset to a better capitalized entity. I think Linda is going either get the business in a position where it can refinance for better terms, or where it can be sold to create shareholder value via a strategic alternative.

If that happen, given this is priced for bankruptcy and ignored by the Street, the returns could easily reach the triple digits. I‚Äôm long and I plan to add on additional weakness.

Everyone is talking about how the squeeze didn't even happen and the shorts didn't cover yet. What I don't understand is why wouldn't that be possible? If short interest is 17%, so let's round up to about 100M shares. Today the volume traded was 700M shares. Couldn't 100M of those 700M have been the shorts covering? And if they didn't cover, today alone 700M shares were traded, why would 100M shares bought by shorts cause a squeeze if today 700M were traded?

I have been having this question for awhile, since I noticed the same with GME. In the days preceding January 28th (when GME reached its peak), the combined volume was several times the amount of float. How come the squeeze happened and why did it happen? If the volume was so high, couldn't the shorts have covered in the days preceding that?

Everything looked to have gone off successfully. We are now waiting on the data and craft to be analysed and inspected. This will take a few weeks according to Michael Colglazier.
That being said he had already outlined the test schedule in the earnings zoom call.

1st test flight - may 
2nd crewed flight - June 
3rd flight with R Branson on board late June/July 

4th flight this will be taking the Italian airforce on a training mission (600k a seat) late July


On the run in to the first test flight some possible maintenance issues appeared with the carrier plane White knight 2‚Ä¶. 
This indeed could have gone either way , after 2 weeks inspections it was decided that WK2 did not need to delay testing no maintenance was needed at this point. Scheduled Maintenance will commence in the fall after all tests have been completed.
Upon this news it is my opinion that the testing programme will go ahead as planned.

The market has responded accordingly and the stock is now up from $17-‚Ç¨31

With all these catalysts lined up before the end of the year and commercial operations looming for early 2022 things are looking up for Virgin Galactic.The success of the last test flight the company have now proven tech and concept.

I had a look at $BB and assume that we finally formed the bottom. In the last few days we saw a sharp rise which might continue in the next weeks. If we can break the 12$ resistance, the next targets would be aroung 25-28$. 

Using Elliot wave theory we are probably at the end of the correction wave 4 and now began with the bullish wave 5.

Price targets:

\#1 12$

\#2 25$

877,,2021-05-28 09:17:32,t3_nmtt43,,wallstreetbets,"Trainline has taken a huge dip since the UK government's announcement of the plan to nationalise the railway network. The plan includes creating an online ticketing platform by Great British Railways which might have a huge blow on Trainline revenue. However, this platform does not yet exist and will probably take a couple of years to develop. Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed.

In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales.  Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%.

I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time  for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

882,,2021-05-28 10:41:01,t3_nmuzzi,,wallstreetbets,"Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent of Modernas if not more. Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects) 

Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

Imagine if the spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize one piece to understand the whole picture it and helps modify your DNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates it can still recognize the virus. In contrast to using one portion of the picture as it mutates it's easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine, that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. Not only that but they have had the least amount of side effects of any covid vaccine deeming it the safest covid vaccine.... 

And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein (whole picture) and the safety profile. Also worth a mention is that you could store it in a regular refrigerator, and let it sit out in room temperature while you're vaccinating people instead of a special ultra low temp freeze needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers, this is a majority of the world. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines so other protein competitors will be far behind and they will have an a moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing they teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine. They will be combining flu and covid vaccine by 2025 for possibly double the price of current covid vaccine.

 They are pretty much de-risked at this point. Yes you could buy other  biotechs that can go up 20x but are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up) that has all successful trials done so far, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment to where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place there are no more glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""

They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. Yesterday at market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. 
 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

Future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract in there ( in the link below in another message). It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 

As far as my position I own some $200 July calls along with about 933 shares. I'm all in baby.  Been in since $4.06, I panicked and sold once during February a couple months during the mini bear market we had and got back in a bit too early so got a wash sale üôà but I'm diamond hands all the way to $800 from here.  LFG I expect to turn that into a cool million in a year's time via shares and options based on the DD provided. Just know this isn't all completely my DD some of this is taken from my good friends at the community Nvax community on Stocktwits. They're one of the most hardcore groups that provides excellent DD and are always willing to help each other a hand if anyone's got questions highly recommend to check it out. So my point is this is information collected over the months that is a group consensus on nvax future price. (Check out next link below this paragraph, it has My positions and an amazing DD chart converting contracts to future price and comparing with competitors. My screen name on stovktwits  is the same on there Johnnyknowsbest. Been on there and here since i started with nvax.

Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. This is huge as the combo is going to differentiate them especially since both flu and covid vaccines are first in class.

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote... By mid-July, we‚Äôll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase precious metals  especially silver amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative 

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

Gold rose over 60% in the 1930s as the prices of stocks and real estate crashed. You could buy an entire block with a one ounce gold coin. Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms.

I must address Cramer's statement because he is obviously trying to add fuel to the short-selling fire: When he says ""we're not going natural gas"" he is clearly making a vague and general statement meant to be interpreted in the worst possible way: ""no one is going to buy or use natural gas."" By now, I hope everyone that is interested in this stock understands that CLNE offers an alternative transportation fuel, thus, the investments made by BP and Chevron, and not revolutionary technology like some EV's (but this is mostly hype meant to catapult EVs to the front. What most people do not realize is that driverless technology and such can be placed in Petro vehicles too). Also, unfortunately, the company has done a terrible marketting job. That's why powerful analysts can get away with making vague and unsupported statements. The fact that Cramer explained the stock's decrease over the last month as being due to widespread dissaproval is misleading, at best. Many people do not yet know about the cleanliness and therapeutic effects RNG has on the climate.

The News...

If you haven't read yet it looks like Federal Cannabis legalization my be around the corner. [Here](https://www.mpp.org/policy/federal/the-more-act/) is the House Bill. Supporters seem on board and like the reforms they have done to the bill including rescheduling cannabis. [Last time](https://mjbizdaily.com/key-us-house-lawmaker-reintroduces-federal-marijuana-legalization-bill/) the bill was introduced it cleared the House.   


Personally I think this gets a lot of support especially from a fiscal point of view. With stimulus stalling and a giant debate going on about how to pay for the stimulus I think cannabis offers the easiest way to collect federal revenue. A simple review of the bill and the fiscal benefits to the Fed's can be read [here](https://www.justtherealnews.com/congress/nadler-blumenauer-lee-jackson-lee-jeffries-velazquez-reintroduce-comprehensive-marijuana-reform-legislation/). The bill states a 5% fed tax. Money coming for uncle Sam, right when questions about paying for stimulus.... Personally I think it adds up, but that's for you to decide. 

Okay so that's the hype...

Let's talk about the tickers listed ($SNDL and $TLRY). 

$SNDL

I'll start with the cheaper YOLO, $SNDL. $SNDL short interest isn't high, but the company did issue convertible notes a while back around .7c if my memory is correct. I'm not saying they won't do it again, but they should be in a good place fiscally for now. Float is high with about 1.6B shares out there. However today's volume at the time of writing is over 415M. That's not bad given such a high float. It's about 200% more than the average volume. 

The options chain on $SNDL has me giddy. With over 200,000 options currently in the money on todays move above $1 there is some high potential here for some interesting action. The put to call ratio is just obnoxiously low at .08 it's screaming upwards betting. If we hold above $1 the potential squeeze up could be amazing.   


It's also broken up on the trend lines and out of the downward channel it was in. The regression channel from the peak squeeze back in Feb just broke out today according to my crayons I have laying around. 

$TLRY

$TLRY was the squeeze of a lifetime if you remember it back in 19'. The ticker was just a money printer with it's low float and stupid hype. Then they proceeded to do, like they all do, and issue debt. Shares tumbled since then falling from $120 --> $5. Ouch bag holders.   


Like all the cannabis stocks the Feb bump pushed $TLRY to above $60 in an amazing move. $TLRY has a lower short interest than $SNDL, but it also has a much lower float at about 300M. Compared to $SNDL the volume here isn't as good, but still remains decently above the avg volume around 36M as of right now. 

If we peep the options chain we also see a crazy low P/C ratio around .11. But we don't have the Open Interest in the chain like $SNDL does unless you roll out to Jun 18. Then we finally get some decent OI.   


Personally I am going with $SNDL. The option's chain looks better, the stock is cheaper, and the short interest is a little better. My advice would be to roll out till at least the Jun 11th $1 strike to not get eaten alive by Theta and IV crush. But WSB does what WSB wants and that's why I love you all.   
Do not go above the $2 strikes IMO. You will get crushed by theta unless we get an insane move, which could happen but I don't see the risk / reward there.",nn326f,MORE ACT / CANNABIS / $SNDL & $TLRY Potential

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday

>Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers‚Äô attempt to corner the market on the metal.

-
>Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926‚Äì2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers‚Äô Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.

-
>By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged‚ÄîMarch 27‚Äîsilver fell to $10.80, the metal‚Äôs biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, ‚ÄúA billion dollars isn‚Äôt what it used to be,‚Äù the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.

-
>To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978‚Äì91) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities.",nn36fw,There is no silver short squeeze happening.

* Large Fleet market in Europe gaining momentum, and 700+ Fisker reservations in this market alone
* 16,000+ reservations already. More than Tesla had 18 months pre-production
* Revenue streams include leasing automotives, servicing, selling emissions credits, selling insurance (like selling the pickaxe to miners, and selling the diamonds to the mine owners too, absolutely genius - Fisker are insuring cars which they own, because the customer is only leasing it)
* High short interest (20%+), high analyst price targets compared to current share price (100%+) and low valuation compared to peers ($3bn market cap currently)
* Designing the first ever all-electric popemobile - Massive, soon to be historic, event!
* I give $FSR (currently $13 a share) a price target of $100 by end of year 2022, if not sooner
* Price Targets: $35 by end of year - Previous ATH. $50 start of next year - European and Chinese debut of prototypes. $100 end of 2022 - start of production (SOP). $150+ 2023
* 2025 Price Targets, calculated using projected data: Bear case - $97 a share, Bull case - $519 a share
* Downside in the short term is capped by the large amount of cash on hand - one third of market cap is cash. Long term, is capped by risk factors, which are almost eligible and affect every automotive startup anyway.

## Fisker Automotive

In 2008, Fisker Automotive raised over $90 million from investors including venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. In September 2009, Fisker Automotive was awarded a $528 million loan guarantee by the United States Department of Energy (DOE). The automaker was one of four recipients of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, to encourage the domestic manufacture of electric cars. The funds were to be used to develop the Karma, as well as an affordable family-size plug-in hybrid car. The loan facility was frozen at $192 million in February 2012, after the DOE claimed that Fisker missed its milestones

In December 2011, just as the Fisker Karma was launched, its battery supplier, A123 Systems, recalled all batteries, followed by a second recall in 2012. A123 filed for bankruptcy in October 2012, leaving Fisker Automotive without a battery supplier. After selling approximately 2,000 units, production of the Fisker Karma was suspended in November 2012, in the absence of its battery supplier.

&#x200B;

Henrik Fisker resigned as chairman from Fisker Automotive in March 2013, because of disagreements with management about business strategy. Later that year, the company declared voluntary bankruptcy.Fisker raised and spent more than a billion dollars over its lifetime.The heart of Fisker‚Äôs business model was in that early deal with Quantum. The idea was to design a gorgeous car, and have suppliers like Quantum provide the technology because off-the-shelf parts from suppliers would help keep costs down.

But there were problems with this strategy: Sometimes, those parts had to be custom-made to fit the design vision, which resulted in higher prices for Fisker. Other times, parts were delivered late or, worse, faulty, but Fisker was locked in to those supplier relationships. Sources close to Fisker have also said that many of the parts were owned by the suppliers themselves, so Fisker didn‚Äôt own a lot of the internal technology.

The broker that raised funds for Fisker automotive, by selling their private shares, was Advanced Equities.It wasn‚Äôt until December 2011 and into 2012 that the more dubious efforts of Advanced Equities became clearer to Fisker‚Äôs hundreds of investors. The last few hundred million dollars of Advanced Equities‚Äô fund raising for Fisker, starting with the D-1 round, was what brokers call ‚Äúpay to play.‚Äù As Fisker was running into technical, delivery and political problems, its valuation was quickly declining. But the company still needed more money, so the brokers went back to its current investors and said: Unless you give this more, your current shares will be diluted and your preferred stock will be converted to common stock.

It was essentially a gun to their heads. This is why investor Wray sued Fisker in February 2012, alleging he was on the receiving end of this tactic. In his lawsuit, he says Advanced Equities sent him a letter dated Jan. 18, 2012, stating that he needed to decide if he wanted to invest in Fisker‚Äôs next round, and pay around $84,000 by Jan. 27, 2012 ‚Äî a little over a week from receiving the letter. He also says that Advanced Equities assured him that he would have anti-dilution protection. According to the audio clip from Advanced Equities‚Äô internal sales call in early 2010, Advanced Equity leaders say that the Fisker deal will ‚Äúsuffer no dilution,‚Äù and was ‚Äúa dream scenario.‚Äù

That dream would soon end. In September 2012 after Fisker closed on $1.2 billion in funding, the bulk of it organized by Advanced Equities, the SEC charged the broker with misleading investors when it raised money for another company back in 2009 and 2010 (Bloom Energy). Advanced settled, agreeing to pay $1 million, and its co-founders were personally fined. Two months later Advanced Equities closed up shop.

Later, A123 Systems itself went bankrupt, causing more problems for Fisker. Fisker claimed that A123 Systems owed it $140 million, but a bankruptcy settlement reduced that to a paltry $15 million.

Then there was the just plain terrible luck for the ironically named Karma: Super Storm Sandy wiped out 338 of its Karmas in storage in New Jersey. The cars first drowned, and then caught on fire ‚Äî salt water damage caused a short circuit that was spread to other cars by high winds, Fisker said at the time.

With all of this happening in public ‚Äî and in a presidential election year ‚Äî Fisker‚Äôs struggles became highly politicized. The company was mentioned numerous times in presidential debates and speeches leading up to the election. Republican nominee Romney called Fisker and other DOE-supported companies losers.

The company didn‚Äôt seem to invest substantially in technology innovation or tech IP, and seemed to spend a disproportionate amount on suppliers. For example, numerous sources have said that the company paid upfront for 15,000 of some of the parts for its planned 15,000 Karmas. It ended up only selling around 2,000 of the cars. It has also been said that Fisker paid some funds upfront to have BMW make engines for the 100,000 Nina cars it hoped to produce ‚Äî in the end, Fisker didn‚Äôt deliver a single Nina.

Costs to build each Karma also creeped up because the company missed its volume targets, and because engineering had to change designs around supplier constraints. The company ended up adding $20,000 to its initial sale price.

Expensive hires may also have sucked away chunks of Fisker‚Äôs funding: Sources say that Fisker filled the upper levels of the company with seasoned auto executives from Detroit. At the high point of Fisker, the company had around 300 employees, plus dozens of contract staff. Bringing in a certain amount of the old guard could help a car startup ramp up quickly, and also impress potential investors with ‚Äúindustry names.‚Äù But those people are also used to big auto-industry budgets that included extensive travel and salaries ‚Äî that‚Äôs the opposite life of a tech startup.

## Fisker Inc.

In July 2016, Henrik Fisker expressed interest in designing a fully connected electric car with autonomous driving features and an aesthetically pleasing look. He has pursued battery technology, and hinted at potentially reviving the Fisker name with a pure-electric vehicle using technology that nobody else has. Since then Fisker has talked about delays to the promised solid state battery technology, which he does not expect to be able to be produced in volume until at least 2025. Posing risk for competition from more scientifically experienced future solid state battery producers such as Quantumscape.

***Forbes:*** ‚ÄúNow he‚Äôs back‚Äìand three things are different. First and foremost, he has a vital new partner: his wife, cofounder and Fisker Inc. CFO Geeta Gupta-Fisker. Second, his Los Angeles-based company is public this time around, raising more than $1 billion in an October 2020 IPO. And finally, Fisker‚Äôs stock price, up 56% since its debut, has made both Henrik and Geeta billionaires, each worth about $1.1 billion as of Friday‚Äôs market close. The auto industry has seen father-son and sibling leadership teams, but Fisker Inc.‚Äôs CEO-CFO combo is the fast-changing sector‚Äôs first husband and wife power couple.‚Äù

Wealth isn‚Äôt the purpose of the new company, Henrik says. ‚ÄúI never got into cars because of money. (This shows he is willing to do what is in the best interest of the company because he is not motivated by money, unlike 99% of other CEO‚Äôs)

The couple sought a big stake in the new venture to ensure they can control its fate in a way Fisker couldn‚Äôt with his earlier company.

Henrik is an auto industry celebrity, but Geeta‚Äôs background is equally impressive. A native of India, she holds multiple degrees in science, including a Ph.D. in biotechnology from Cambridge University where she was also a Research Newton Fellow. From there, she started a career in international investment for Lloyds Banking Group, and then managed investments for a high-net-worth client for several years. (In particular, this is insanely important - Geeta **KNOWS MONEY**! She knows how best to keep a company afloat, organize its share structure, provide value to shareholders, etc. because she has worked in the industry before. She may just be the most important element of Fisker Inc., due to the financial experience she has. At every step of the way, she is likely to make decisions with one sole focus - increasing share price and value).

She met her future husband in 2011 when he was visiting London, just before things started going very wrong at Fisker Automotive. They married in 2012.

‚ÄúWhen I left Fisker Automotive, all I had was my car,‚Äù Henrik remembers. ‚ÄúI'm in a different position, mainly because of Geeta. Because she cuts the deals.‚Äù

To get the new venture off the ground, the Fiskers invested the majority of their life savings‚Äìan enormous financial risk given the fate of Henrik‚Äôs prior company. Then, just as they were locking in plans for the IPO back in July, they were hit by a highly unwelcome complication: Geeta learned she had early-stage breast cancer.

‚ÄúShe got the call (from her doctor) during a call with investors,‚Äù Henrik says. Despite that bombshell, she continued working with banks and investors in the weeks that followed, even as she underwent two surgical procedures and radiation therapy. Her medical therapy concluded in November.

Henrik, who marvels at her fortitude throughout the health crisis says, ‚Äúshe only missed something like one day of work...That's just how she is. She works tirelessly.‚Äù

## Fisker Ocean

The Fisker Ocean will have a nearly 300-mile range with an 80 kWh battery and a solar panel roof as a range extender, adding approximately 1,000 free miles of range per year. Advanced electronics will be housed under the hood, and the vehicle will incorporate recycled and sustainable materials throughout. Deliveries of the Ocean are scheduled to begin in 2022.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s87j6bdsfw171.png?width=438&format=png&auto=webp&s=e40add9ce53319d31db242cce73a303afb03cbab

Fisker has also announced a partnership with Electrify America to ensure Fisker Ocean vehicles will integrate seamlessly with Electrify America charging stations when the e-SUV hits the market. With features such as a solar roof and recycled inner materials, it will be, according to Fisker Inc., the ""world's most sustainable vehicle.""

In 2017, Fisker Inc. announced that it had filed patents on flexible solid-state battery designs. Fisker expected the batteries to be produced on a mass scale around 2020. A prototype of the battery debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018. In October 2018, Fisker announced new funding for battery development through Caterpillar Venture Capital. The solid-state batteries are intended to deliver longer vehicle range and faster charging times.

In 2018, Fisker was named to the board of directors of First Cobalt, a North American cobalt refinery that produces battery materials.

In September 2019, it was announced that Fisker Inc. was partnering with Game of Thrones actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who will serve as a partner and sustainability adviser to Fisker, to work on advanced, affordable, electric mobility models.

&#x200B;

[In addition to being a well-known actor, Coster-Waldau is also the United Nations Development Program Goodwill Ambassador for climate change and other social issues.](https://preview.redd.it/3hssff5vfw171.png?width=451&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebe55e2468c5b63d1bc0ac3c71547219dff5afaa)

Nikolaj wrote this piece about Fisker:

To quote a friend of mine who is a lot smarter than me, architect Bjarke Ingels: ‚ÄúThe idea that sustainability needs to sacrifice quality of life is a flawed one. It‚Äôs a design challenge, a challenge to build something that transforms the idea of sustainability into something that will increase the quality of life for all those around it.‚Äù

One person meeting that challenge is Henrik Fisker, who has designed some of the most iconic cars over the past decades for BMW and others, like the BMW Z8, Aston Martin DB9 and Aston Martin V8 Vantage. He‚Äôs a hero for gas-guzzling supercars. He is a fellow Dane, I am a fan, and we met, of all places, on Twitter.

When we met in person, he described his new project ‚Äî an all-electric luxury SUV ‚Äî and asked me if I would help spread the word on his car. The problem as I see it with most electric cars is that they only accomplish the basics. They get you from point A to B. They run electric so you don‚Äôt pollute while driving, but that‚Äôs it. They are basically unattractive combustion engine cars that have a battery thrown into them ‚Äî and for most of them, a battery with a limited range. What Fisker does is to try to make every part of the car in a sustainable and attractive way, like a full-length solar roof, recycled floor mats and vegan leather seats. It looks incredibly cool and inviting, with a great 250- to 300-mile range, and at a cost of just under $40,000, it‚Äôs a luxury car affordable to a mass market.

I said yes and even became an investor, not only because it‚Äôs a great car but more importantly, I hope and believe it can inspire other companies to actively incorporate sustainability goals into all aspects of their business. Fisker then had the idea of calling me ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù adviser. Which I am not. Just to be clear. Thanks Henrik, sounds cool, but I am an actor and a citizen, and that‚Äôs really it.

And what about Hollywood? Is our industry changing, are we at the forefront? Looking at social media, you would think so. And things are happening, but usually only when a camera is pointed at people. Remember a few years back when all awards shows only used EVs for the red carpet? We made a difference. We mattered. We showed the way. So cool. So green, so ‚Ä¶ brief. Now it‚Äôs back to the Escalade. But hey, we are not using plastic straws anymore!

To believe that change will come from Hollywood is not really based in reality (when did that stop us?), but we are great at reacting ‚Äî and things around us are changing, and changing us. I have a good friend who loves his SUV. It‚Äôs not electric. But he cannot give up his car. He is a good guy, he‚Äôs works for the U.N., so if he has a problem going electric, we all do. But if he is presented with an alternative that doesn‚Äôt mean a reduction in his quality of life, something like the Fisker SUV, I think he‚Äôd transition to electric in a heartbeat.

The IPO deal values Fisker Inc at US$2.9 billion, with an IPO share price of $10.

On July 30, 2020, Fisker announced plans for a four-vehicle portfolio by 2025. The Fisker Ocean SUV will be joined by a sports sedan based on their previously announced Fisker Emotion concept, a coupe-like SUV, and a lifestyle pickup truck. All will be electric vehicles.

On October 15, 2020, Fisker Inc announced it would be outsourcing vehicle production of its Fisker Ocean electric SUV to Magna Steyr, to reduce the complexities and costs related to the building and operating its own factory. Magna will start building the Fisker Ocean in Europe in 2022.

## Henrik Fisker Interview quotes:

I have people on Twitter saying, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just make the car next month? You have a prototype.‚Äù Most people don‚Äôt understand that it takes 18 months to do long-lead body tooling for high-volume vehicles. Most people don‚Äôt understand it takes two years to do durability tests and do all the engineering certification and everything else.

And on the business model itself, I believe that there is nobody in the near future or the next couple of years that‚Äôs going to make a million EVs on one model. Today, there‚Äôs nobody doing it. Tesla probably has the highest volume of one single model, a couple hundred thousand. But even the big giant established carmakers are not making, right now, a couple hundred thousand vehicles of one model. So the way you get volume, in my view, is if you partner up with other OEMs and share some of the expensive parts of the platform, which in my view is not anymore something that is unique IP or something that is a unique experience to the customer. An aluminum stamped floor or a steel stamped floor really doesn‚Äôt have any brand value anymore.

And obviously, as we move forward, we always start to do some of the things ourselves. But it was really about de-risking in our first vehicle to market. So we‚Äôre going to do another three vehicles, which we can do because we don‚Äôt have to spend all our money and effort on learning how to manufacture a car, for instance.

So we have programmed a lot. We have hired a head of ESG, environmental and social governance, and he is really spearheading developing specific... we kind of put out some goals that we would like to reach with suppliers, and we at least try to bring them in that direction. They are not reaching those goals right now, but they may reach them later. And then we have goals for ourselves. So for instance, we look at transport. Are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs closer to the plant, or are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs on the other side of the planet that way we have to then transport all that stuff. So those are the types of things that we‚Äôre really thinking about now as we‚Äôre nominating suppliers. And finally, materials as well, looking at sustainable materials. We‚Äôve actually picked up a lot of knowledge on that side as well, where we are adding more sustainable materials to our vehicle. So we are actually looking across everything ‚Äî supply chain, where the suppliers are located, what the suppliers are doing for sustainability, and also then of course in the vehicle itself ‚Äî in terms of the type of materials there.

So - let's summarize - prices are rising at their fastest pace in almost 30 years and incomes just plunged by their most ever! We're gonna need more stimmies!""  

Plus  to above; 

Last year, Hirschman Capital noted that since 1821, 98% of sovereigns that hit 130% debt/GDP have defaulted on their sovereign debt.   

The US hit 130% late last year. 

Simple Conclussion : The Fed can‚Äôt go ‚Äúhawkish‚Äù and raise rates without sending markets ‚Äìand economies‚Äìto their knees; by extension, they now have nothing left to ‚Äúcut‚Äù when the current everything bubble implodes.

And that  is a *real problem*.

 There are only two ways for sovereigns to default: 

Inflation or collapse.    

The latter is not an option. 

 As for a solution, what‚Äôs so tragic is that the only option before the Fed is an even bigger problem‚Äîcurrent and inevitably more inflation. 

 That is, if the Fed wants to keep markets (and their job security) breathing, they no longer have the foregoing template of ‚Äúrate-hike-followed-by-rate-cutting‚Äù at their disposal, which means they now have no choice but to dovishly keep rates near the zero-bound indefinitely.

But the only way to keep rates ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù and nailed to the floor of time is to purchase otherwise unwanted bonds to keep their prices elevated and hence yields and rates repressed.

Such bond ‚Äúaccommodation,‚Äù of course, costs money, and as we already know, the only ‚Äúmoney‚Äù the Fed has to spend is the kind they create out of thin air‚Äì the very kind of money (and policy) which leads to the kind of inflation discussed above‚Äînamely, the brutal kind.

 As for that fake money, the evidence of the Fed‚Äôs desperate (and only) direction is now obvious, as the following M2 money supply makes equally clear. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v774ta55sw171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e73c839beb67a67eea9aed7de4ac61d86813840

 

Fed is so embarrassed by this ‚Äúprinting solution‚Äù that they‚Äôve stopped *weekly* reporting of M2 data, and frankly, since March, have even stopped *monthly* reporting of the same.

That, of course, is both telling as well as disgraceful‚Ä¶ The Fed literally has something to hide, and that never bodes well, does it?

&#x200B;

 The correlation to central bank balance sheet (i.e., money supply) expansion and rising markets is now beyond dispute. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sgizb6xcsw171.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=aad2fe681fe0c49ac20368aba77e86c118b22959

 In short‚Äîdo you see the correlation and pattern? Do you see how the Fed‚Äôs market sausage is made? More importantly, do you now see the Fed‚Äôs self-made conundrum? 

 

Given that the Fed bows to the markets not the people, which choice do you think they‚Äôll make?

In other words, expect more money printing and more yield curve control‚Äîand hence more money creation, more inflation, and by extension more fiat currency debasement.

 More money supply to keep rates monetized simply means more currency debasement and rising inflation.",nn51ou,"""Fed's ""Favorite"" #Inflation Indicator (PCE) Explodes At Fastest Rate Since 1992 As Incomes Crash By Record"""

I have leading indicators telling me that there are two concurrent shifts underway when it comes to who is purchasing homes.

\- Massive increase in unmarried people buying houses alone. This used to be somewhat unusual, now it's becoming very common.

\- Massive increase in unmarried men, in particular, buying houses alone. Traditionally, the female-to-male ratio of unmarried homebuyers was about 5 to 1. For the last 3 months, it's been closer to 50/50.

Source is my own closed real estate purchase transactions. Am a mortgage broker (btw this means cash purchases are ""invisible"" to me). It takes 3-6 months for [HMDA data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Mortgage_Disclosure_Act) to become accessible to journalists and academics, and thus ""visible"" to the general public (assuming journalists deem it worthy of commenting on), but I can see the trends live in real time.

How would one go about placing a bet that in about 3 or 6 months, the media, journalists, academics, etc, will pick up on this, publish articles, and potentially cause a lot of people to buy certain stocks. Which stocks would that be? Is there a ""Mancave, Inc"" out there that would potentially get an uptick? Or maybe a company making smart-home stuff that is particularly suited to renting by the room (the single men are not buying 1 bedroom condos, they are buying proper houses with 3 bedrooms, etc)?

EDIT: oh, and to be clear. It's not just an uptick in single men. It's an uptick in women too, but a massive surge from the men. It used to be that for 15 banana sales, 10 are to married couples, 4 to single women, and 1 to a single man.

Note this was the retard‚Äôs first option trade so he was going bananas seeing all the fucking ü§ë tendies. The retard was bullish and let the stock run until it got smack down. Instead of rolling the calls and taking a profit he was hopeful and waiting for the stock to bounce back up. After AMC dropped to 31 then to 26 he said fuck it let it run till then end hoping for one last minute run.

Also, Florida just passed legal online sports betting which is HUGE.

More sports betting on the Draftkings sportsbook and the Draftkings Daily fantasy will increase earnings for the company which is almost always good for stock growth. Since the stadiums are open now there is a more emotional energy with sports right now and that is making people make emotional bets on DraftKings.

If the shares are counted by votes which is supposed to happen on 6/2/21, then all the Hedgefunds have to do is not vote, right? How does share voting/count work? 

How will they prove that synthetic shares exist if not many people participate in the count? Is it mandatory?

Is the current short interest enough to initiate a short squeeze? I think it's only at 17% at the moment, seems a little low to be honest.

Today session low was 24.10 but we were hovering at 25.80 strong during market and post market. Price hasn't dropped since Thursday's major bull run.

Institutional investors definitely have skin in the game. Volume of 659 million. Some candles had major lift that needs millions to do so

Since the trading day did not lose much ground from the previous day, the only way shares would trade lower is heavy shorting at around $34ish today and buying back lower and repeat.

All charts identical today for all ""meme stocks"". They were ready and they just wanted bullish calls to expire.

I still think they are going to have a huge share buyback of over 14m shares (their buyback program was increased from 75m to 475m) in stock and add to the insider owned shares which is now at 54.80% over the week it has gone up about 2%. Which is a bullish signal. If 14m shares were bought that would leave about 51m shares to be traded publicly and the insider owned share percentage would go to about 62% which would be a large driving factor in the price going up due to scarcity.

[When we last left our hero,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrly28/the_legend_of_utheemperorofjenks_aka_ornamental/) he had just lost all of his rent money and what he could advance from credit cards on a failed Super Bowl bet, and a YOLO on ‚ÄúRhodium‚Äù that he ordered from a sketchy Slovakian Wish.com ripoff. Alas, it was, of course, fake, and he was broke and depressed. It might have been the first fatal case of autism. He thought to himself ‚ÄúAm I really that retarded?‚Äù Then, he realized ‚ÄúNo, it must be Oklahoma that‚Äôs retarded!‚Äù

So, [after a brief case of violent diarrhea from Oklahoma Grocery Store sushi](https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/lrslbb/psa_do_not_eat_grocery_store_sushi_right_now/), he was ready to hatch his plan! Uruguay! Yes, Uruguay. [He was going to move to Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lh5igx/c%C3%B3mo_se_puede_llegar_a_melo_desde_montevideo_sin/)

His plans for this move could‚Äôve been anyone‚Äôs guess. One possibility he inquired about was [how to be a Tea Blendmaster.](https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/lfga0m/how_does_one_become_a_blendmaster/) [Another was him possibly reconnecting with God.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/lsij6j/agnostic_jew_seeking_faith_in_god/) Yet, he seemed to be asking questions about another topic more often than the others...

[Bees.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lxcnt1/c%C3%B3mo_es_la_legalidad_de_la_apicultura_informal/)

Specifically, beekeeping, a topic he admitted he had no experience in, [as evident from him looking for any book on the subject as an introduction months before.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/)

What he planned on doing with the bees was anyone‚Äôs guess, and I doubt he thought it through that much either. One post **AFTER** he took possession of 200,000 bees (we‚Äôll get to that later,) was [asking Americans if there was a demand for mead in the states.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/) So, was he thinking of importing Uruguayan honey to the US to be made into mead? Was he going to make it himself? Did he move to another continent for no reason? Let‚Äôs all find out!

A little more than 2 months ago, he finally did it. [He moved to Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/m9ejpn/la_paloma/) And about a week after that, [he was driving a truck filled with 200k bees across his new country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/) Based on replies in that thread, he was aiming to have [a monopoly on beekeeping in the country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/gt48gke/)

[He picked up his hives without complication.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mtkkf3/about_to_upsize_my_apiary_whats_the_best_layout/) [And then he settled into Melo, Uruguay, and set up his apiary ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/n1jnte/my_humble_apiary_near_melo_uruguay/). Life was good.

But, trouble was afoot. According to a reply, [the species he was planning on keeping had literally never been kept by keepers in Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mtkkf3/about_to_upsize_my_apiary_whats_the_best_layout/gv0viej/) And then, disaster struck. [He went to TIFU to post his tale of spreading an invasive species in an industry he knew nothing about.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/nmd69k/tifu_by_importing_bees_to_uruguay/)

Indeed, he had no idea even what a bee was until he stumbled his way through a book, and then decided to YOLO into honey in Uruguay. He somehow got in touch with an ecology professor in Montevideo that would help him set things up in exchange for grad students fucking with them every now and again. Oh, and the bees were from fucking Myanmar. Handshake agreement, of course. Total Chad move.

And like I said before, the rest went without incident for a while. It would take the bees ‚Äúa year‚Äù to make honey, so he just kinda hung out, stayed busy, and tried to find part time work in a foreign country he arrived in 2.5 months earlier.

And then, the professor ghosted him. Just disappeared. Shortly thereafter, government agents come out about this kid from Oklahoma illegally importing a non-native bee to their country. Apparently his bees had been fucking with other apiaries. So, he did probably the smartest thing he‚Äôs ever done.

He ran.

He fucking ran from the Uruguayan government, took a plane to LAX, and arrived with $14 to his name. His friend sent him $100, which wasn‚Äôt enough to go back to Oklahoma, so he took a $75 flight to Seattle, where he is also not from.

His last post is from a train out of the airport, with $39 to his name. I don‚Äôt know what is in store for him, but I know that $39 is as good as spent on urchin futures or whatever market he‚Äôs going to crash up there.

1363,,2021-05-28 03:12:37,t3_nmofz4,,wallstreetbets,"This started as a comment reply but I thought maybe people would like reading it. I've been researching Palantir since literally late November 2020 and I have nearly my entire portfolio in LEAPS expiring January 2023. So I have continually done more research on them this is just the basics to clear up confusion and help people who don't understand it because it's hard to hear all the hype and stuff. Also AMC to the moon tomorrow for my FDs I bought!! Don't judge me it's just fun to be in on the action on weeks like this.


So you should think of palantir as basically three companies and they actually are very far from unprofitable. 

They developed the really massive government software (gotham) specifically as a result of an interaction that happened to Peter Thiel while he was at paypal. They were losing millions to foreign scammers at paypal and the solution ended up being a high quality algorithm that flagged the most likely scam transactions and then allowed analysts to efficiently double check and verify the real scam transactions.

 It essentially was using what computers are efficient at (sorting through massive amounts of data) and then combining that with what humans are good at (looking at the more complex nuances that at least at that point computer algorithms were incapable of doing) and augmenting the humans ability to make complex decisions by rapidly sorting through the incoming data and bringing everything good to their attention.

They fixed paypals using this method and literally made the company profitable overnight because of fixing how much they were losing in the scam transactions. The FBI contacted PayPal and Thiel about using that initial software. That was literally his inspiration for what would become Palantir. He goes over it in huge detail in his book zero to one. If you make an audible account you can read it for free and find the chapter I'm talking about.

Then for 15 years they perfected the government software into the absolute nearly monopoly it is now in government intelligence augmentation software. The whole time though they reinvested almost everything for the last 10 years into building the commercial software (Foundry). That side of the business has only been live for a VERY short time and initially they literally didn't spend a single dollar on marketing their first commercial clients sought THEM out because of their insane reputation with the government. Foundry helps with supply chains and all kinds of other important data  insights. But if you want a recent example the NIH and the NHS both used Foundry to figure out how to best distribute the vaccine and vaccine distribution in the US and Britain has far outpaced expectations. You think commercial companies aren't going to be interested in using the software that was literally proven on a level like that?

 They're only just now adding huge amounts of people to their sales teams literally in the last six months which if you read Peter thiels book is insane for the stock because they have this crazy long term plan and he literally talks about how when they get to a certain point and start adding sales as a full sector of the company it means that is the company the company plans to BEGIN scaling. Meaning they're this big and they literally only just started on the scaling part. Which they've also said in tons of interviews if you're a die hard Palantirian like me. 



They actually also have the third side of the  business which is their actual like full AI for weaponization and war and defense for the government. Gotham is like helping analysts and commanders lead and even helping police or agents figure out what's going on. This other software is different. It's called Apollo and its only at the beginning too. It's like pure AI machine learning AI handles everything stuff. Go find a video called pentagon head of NSC briefs public on AI I think it's on the PBS channel on YouTube or some shit. Or you can listen to Joe Biden talk about how we're going to double our percentage of gdp spending on AI. The amount of government money that's going to go into AI as a weapon to compete with China DWARFS peoples expectations of how much large the market for the kind of software palantir makes is. 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201001005334/en/U.S.-Army-Research-Lab-Selects-Palantir-Technologies-Inc.-for-91M-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-Development

This is literally the backbone of everything AI that the government is about to invest in. Sure they're going to experiment with other research but if you do research you'll also find Palantir is the ONLY company that does anything remotely like this software that has anywhere near the kind of clearances like what is required for these contracts. They are currently a clearance level 5 and about to be the highest 6. The closest competitors are almost all a 3 or lower I'm not even sure if there's more than a single 4 and that stuff is crazy hard to get. 

But like again I'm an obsessive. I realize why people get so excited about the commercial side scaling and how it's very possible and can make them huge and it will. But I'm actually pretty sure the reason people like Cathy Wood has such a huge boner for them is that she realizes how MASSIVELY. And I mean MASSIVELY underestimated the amount of government revenue they will get from all this AI investing the United States and NATO are about to do. It's literally the next Manhattan project and they're absolutely going to be one of the biggest players developing it if not the biggest. I think it's funny because most people are pretty disinterested in the government stuff for Palantir but i really think the weaponized AI apollo stuff may be as big as anything could ever be. 




Also people got the insider selling stuff very very wrong. Tom Nash (love him or hate him I don't care) has a few really good recent videos where he explains it in basically full detail what was happening. The selling panicked a lot of retail investors during a time when the buying for growth markets had really slowed because of rate hike due to inflation scares and a ton of retail holders got scared and caused more selling and more people got scared because of that and sold and it really just was mass psychology in effect and a LOT of FUD and confusion. 

Basically a few executives karp in particular got billions of dollars worth of options that vest but literally expire so you have to exercise them which means you buy shares of the company at a strike price. Well because it's the company granting shares the strike price is literally 10 cents or something and these automatically have to vest at quarterly increments. So everytime karp was exercising he's actually buying shares. Like over 150 million in total maybe a lot more million SHARES not dollars. shares. And even those when he exercising he's buying shares technically from the company it ALL counts as profit on taxes and ITS NOT LONG TERM CAP GAINS ELIGIBLE. So over the last year plus this year he's essentially getting shares but the literal dollar value of those shares to the government counts as pure profit. So his total income which he's getting taxed at 40% of is in the BILLIONS yes billions. Because that's a lot to handle people that work for them actually automatically schedule sells of shares to cover the taxes so that there's no issue it's not even like him saying sell today and they do this.... TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INSIDER SELLING TO THE SEC. That's why it's automatically happening so no one can ever claim he's timing it. 

So listen cause here's where it gets important. The exercising of the shares counts as almost pure profits but remember he's receiving SHARES not dollars he doesn't actually get billions of dollars. So has to then sell SOME of the shares so he can pays taxes on that. Then when he sells the shares to pay the taxes for exercising he actually owes even more money if they went up from when he exercised. So everytime he's selling low its actually good for him because it's less ADDITIONAL PROFIT that he would owe taxes on.

 If he wasn't selling its because he thought it would go down even further and then he would actually owe less taxes overall. So if he thought it was going to tank he'd wait and actually get a nice fat discount on his taxes. 

I know this seems really crazy but I promise that's how it works you can look it up in detail but yeah shocking that mainstream media and redditors/youtubers who barely do research and have no real understanding of how these billion dollar compensations work would get it wrong. Unbelievable I know. If he had actually sold the massive overall percentage of his shares that some people claim he did the company would be at like $3-6 dollars not low 20s. Retail got confused because of market pressured due to interest rate fears from inflation and sold low (like retail always does) to institutions.",nmofz4,"Palantir DD if you want to understand company and it's history better (also insider ""selling"" explained in detail)"

What is Blue Apron?


Blue Apron (NYSE: APRN) was the forgotten step child, bad luck Brian, IPO of summer 2017 that priced below range and had the misfortune of debuting after Amazon bought Whole Foods. Since it‚Äôs debut, the stock has suffered dropping from nearly $150 per share (adjusted for a 2019 reverse-split necessitated to stay listed) to as low as approximately $2.00!


Why the Drop?


Management. Fucking. Sucked. The prior executive team essentially handed Chad Hello Fresh the keys to the kingdom, when they made the fatal error of betting that the ‚Äúhigh affinity core users‚Äù would be enough to sustain the business. For this reason, they cut marketing to nearly nothing and attempted to realize operating leverage by shrinking the customer base only to its most prolific buyers.

This was stupid. HelloFresh did the opposite, essentially giving away meals, and they used it to stockpile market share. Put a chart up of HelloFresh customers against Blue Apron. You‚Äôll see the two lines converge and a clear indication that HelloFresh stole most of their business. HelloFresh was one of the best trades of the past 5 years. Look at the chart, look at the sales, and look at the margins. They have managed to achieve operating leverage by employing affordable pricing and emphasizing retention.


Blue Apron Might Go Under....


Today the company is in a dire place. Languishing away in Micro Cap hell at an $80M market cap, no one on Wall Street wants to cover these guys. Only their bankers, CG and MS, write them research and neither are overly optimistic. They‚Äôre in a shit spot with a credit line that mandates they keep $15M cash at all times, and they keep their customer base above 300K (thus far, they‚Äôve struggled). They‚Äôre sitting on $29M and burn enough cash per Q that they might go below that $15M level (wouldn‚Äôt be a first). All signs are negative...


But I Think They Might Win


Blue Apron is under new management. Linda Kozlowski, is the former COO of ETSY and an ex-strategist at Alibaba. She believes HelloFresh did things right and she wants to right the ship. Her ballsy-ass plan is to ride the line on cash and go all in on customer growth. She realizes those customers are worth a lot more than income on the P&L, and that she needs to make the pot as big as she can. Thus far, it‚Äôs worked. Customers are up over 20% in the past two periods and retention rates are rising. We are seeing signs of operating leverage, and it opens a big possibility.


My Prediction

Management is buying shares. They know the company is not healthy. The only logic is that they have a plan that‚Äôs working. You can‚Äôt sell a dying business with a shrinking share, but you can certainly sell a growing community, that could be an accretive asset to a better capitalized entity. I think Linda is going either get the business in a position where it can refinance for better terms, or where it can be sold to create shareholder value via a strategic alternative.

If that happen, given this is priced for bankruptcy and ignored by the Street, the returns could easily reach the triple digits. I‚Äôm long and I plan to add on additional weakness.

If short interest is 17%, so let's round up to about 100M shares. Today the volume traded was 700M shares. Couldn't 100M of those 700M have been the shorts covering? And if they didn't cover, today alone 700M shares were traded, why would 100M shares bought by shorts cause a squeeze if today 700M were traded?

I have been having this question for awhile, since I noticed the same with GME. In the days preceding January 28th (when GME reached its peak), the combined volume was several times the amount of float. How come the squeeze happened and why did it happen? If the volume was so high, couldn't the shorts have covered in the days preceding that?

I hope this makes sense and I really hope someone will be kind enough to explain a fellow retard who only knows about crayons what this all means.

Everything looked to have gone off successfully. We are now waiting on the data and craft to be analysed and inspected. This will take a few weeks according to Michael Colglazier.
That being said he had already outlined the test schedule in the earnings zoom call.

1st test flight - may 
2nd crewed flight - June 
3rd flight with R Branson on board late June/July 

4th flight this will be taking the Italian airforce on a training mission (600k a seat) late July


On the run in to the first test flight some possible maintenance issues appeared with the carrier plane White knight 2‚Ä¶. 
This indeed could have gone either way , after 2 weeks inspections it was decided that WK2 did not need to delay testing no maintenance was needed at this point. Scheduled Maintenance will commence in the fall after all tests have been completed.
Upon this news it is my opinion that the testing programme will go ahead as planned.

The market has responded accordingly and the stock is now up from $17-‚Ç¨31

With all these catalysts lined up before the end of the year and commercial operations looming for early 2022 things are looking up for Virgin Galactic.The success of the last test flight the company have now proven tech and concept.

I had a look at $BB and assume that we finally formed the bottom. In the last few days we saw a sharp rise which might continue in the next weeks. If we can break the 12$ resistance, the next targets would be aroung 25-28$. 

Using Elliot wave theory we are probably at the end of the correction wave 4 and now began with the bullish wave 5.

Price targets:

\#1 12$

\#2 25$

\#3 48$

1386,,2021-05-28 09:17:32,t3_nmtt43,,wallstreetbets,"Trainline has taken a huge dip since the UK government's announcement of the plan to nationalise the railway network. The plan includes creating an online ticketing platform by Great British Railways which might have a huge blow on Trainline revenue. However, this platform does not yet exist and will probably take a couple of years to develop. Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed.

In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales.  Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%.

I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time  for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

1391,,2021-05-28 10:41:01,t3_nmuzzi,,wallstreetbets,"Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent of Modernas if not more. Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects) 

Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

Imagine if the spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize one piece to understand the whole picture it and helps modify your DNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates it can still recognize the virus. In contrast to using one portion of the picture as it mutates it's easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine, that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. Not only that but they have had the least amount of side effects of any covid vaccine deeming it the safest covid vaccine.... 

And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein (whole picture) and the safety profile. Also worth a mention is that you could store it in a regular refrigerator, and let it sit out in room temperature while you're vaccinating people instead of a special ultra low temp freeze needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers, this is a majority of the world. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines so other protein competitors will be far behind and they will have an a moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing they teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine. They will be combining flu and covid vaccine by 2025 for possibly double the price of current covid vaccine.

 They are pretty much de-risked at this point. Yes you could buy other  biotechs that can go up 20x but are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up) that has all successful trials done so far, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment to where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place there are no more glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""

They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. Yesterday at market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. 
 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

Future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract in there ( in the link below in another message). It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 

As far as my position I own some $200 July calls along with about 933 shares. I'm all in baby.  Been in since $4.06, I panicked and sold once during February a couple months during the mini bear market we had and got back in a bit too early so got a wash sale üôà but I'm diamond hands all the way to $800 from here.  LFG I expect to turn that into a cool million in a year's time via shares and options based on the DD provided. Just know this isn't all completely my DD some of this is taken from my good friends at the community Nvax community on Stocktwits. They're one of the most hardcore groups that provides excellent DD and are always willing to help each other a hand if anyone's got questions highly recommend to check it out. So my point is this is information collected over the months that is a group consensus on nvax future price. (Check out next link below this paragraph, it has My positions and an amazing DD chart converting contracts to future price and comparing with competitors. My screen name on stovktwits  is the same on there Johnnyknowsbest. Been on there and here since i started with nvax.

Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. This is huge as the combo is going to differentiate them especially since both flu and covid vaccines are first in class.

1) We look to the PTON CFO's statement found in the latest earnings call transcript, for guidance:
""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior.""
2) Being that we do not have access to a 10-K filing for Q4 fiscal '19, we will access other filings that do in fact reference numbers from fiscal '19...
A) 10-K filing dated 9/11/2020
B) 10-Q filing dated 5/6/2020
3) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $223.3M under Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19)
But, that is TOTAL Revenue; we need to find out what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike sales...
4) To calculate what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike Sales, we can use numbers from neighboring Q3 (i.e. Three Months Ended March 31, 2019)...
A) On page 6 of the 10-Q, you will find Revenue of ""Connected Fitness Products"" (aka Bike Sales) to be $261.6M
B) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $316.7M
C) % of Bike Sales per TOTAL Revenue: $261.6M / $316.7M * 100 = 82.6% {""Connected Fitness Products"" Revenue (aka Bike Sales)}
5) Apply 82.6% to the TOTAL Revenue $223.3M for Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19): $223.3M x 0.826 = $184.45M {Bike Sales for Q4 of fiscal '19}
6) Per the CFO, ""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior."":

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote... By mid-July, we‚Äôll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase precious metals  especially silver amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative 

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

Gold rose over 60% in the 1930s as the prices of stocks and real estate crashed. You could buy an entire block with a one ounce gold coin. Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms.

I must address Cramer's statement because he is obviously trying to add fuel to the short-selling fire: When he says ""we're not going natural gas"" he is clearly making a vague and general statement meant to be interpreted in the worst possible way: ""no one is going to buy or use natural gas."" By now, I hope everyone that is interested in this stock understands that CLNE offers an alternative transportation fuel, thus, the investments made by BP and Chevron, and not revolutionary technology like some EV's (but this is mostly hype meant to catapult EVs to the front. What most people do not realize is that driverless technology and such can be placed in Petro vehicles too). Also, unfortunately, the company has done a terrible marketting job. That's why powerful analysts can get away with making vague and unsupported statements. The fact that Cramer explained the stock's decrease over the last month as being due to widespread dissaproval is misleading, at best. Many people do not yet know about the cleanliness and therapeutic effects RNG has on the climate.

The News...

If you haven't read yet it looks like Federal Cannabis legalization my be around the corner. [Here](https://www.mpp.org/policy/federal/the-more-act/) is the House Bill. Supporters seem on board and like the reforms they have done to the bill including rescheduling cannabis. [Last time](https://mjbizdaily.com/key-us-house-lawmaker-reintroduces-federal-marijuana-legalization-bill/) the bill was introduced it cleared the House.   


Personally I think this gets a lot of support especially from a fiscal point of view. With stimulus stalling and a giant debate going on about how to pay for the stimulus I think cannabis offers the easiest way to collect federal revenue. A simple review of the bill and the fiscal benefits to the Fed's can be read [here](https://www.justtherealnews.com/congress/nadler-blumenauer-lee-jackson-lee-jeffries-velazquez-reintroduce-comprehensive-marijuana-reform-legislation/). The bill states a 5% fed tax. Money coming for uncle Sam, right when questions about paying for stimulus.... Personally I think it adds up, but that's for you to decide. 

Okay so that's the hype...

Let's talk about the tickers listed ($SNDL and $TLRY). 

$SNDL

I'll start with the cheaper YOLO, $SNDL. $SNDL short interest isn't high, but the company did issue convertible notes a while back around .7c if my memory is correct. I'm not saying they won't do it again, but they should be in a good place fiscally for now. Float is high with about 1.6B shares out there. However today's volume at the time of writing is over 415M. That's not bad given such a high float. It's about 200% more than the average volume. 

The options chain on $SNDL has me giddy. With over 200,000 options currently in the money on todays move above $1 there is some high potential here for some interesting action. The put to call ratio is just obnoxiously low at .08 it's screaming upwards betting. If we hold above $1 the potential squeeze up could be amazing.   


It's also broken up on the trend lines and out of the downward channel it was in. The regression channel from the peak squeeze back in Feb just broke out today according to my crayons I have laying around. 

$TLRY

$TLRY was the squeeze of a lifetime if you remember it back in 19'. The ticker was just a money printer with it's low float and stupid hype. Then they proceeded to do, like they all do, and issue debt. Shares tumbled since then falling from $120 --> $5. Ouch bag holders.   


Like all the cannabis stocks the Feb bump pushed $TLRY to above $60 in an amazing move. $TLRY has a lower short interest than $SNDL, but it also has a much lower float at about 300M. Compared to $SNDL the volume here isn't as good, but still remains decently above the avg volume around 36M as of right now. 

If we peep the options chain we also see a crazy low P/C ratio around .11. But we don't have the Open Interest in the chain like $SNDL does unless you roll out to Jun 18. Then we finally get some decent OI.   


Personally I am going with $SNDL. The option's chain looks better, the stock is cheaper, and the short interest is a little better. My advice would be to roll out till at least the Jun 11th $1 strike to not get eaten alive by Theta and IV crush. But WSB does what WSB wants and that's why I love you all.   
Do not go above the $2 strikes IMO. You will get crushed by theta unless we get an insane move, which could happen but I don't see the risk / reward there.",nn326f,MORE ACT / CANNABIS / $SNDL & $TLRY Potential

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday

>Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers‚Äô attempt to corner the market on the metal.

-
>Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926‚Äì2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers‚Äô Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.

-
>By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged‚ÄîMarch 27‚Äîsilver fell to $10.80, the metal‚Äôs biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, ‚ÄúA billion dollars isn‚Äôt what it used to be,‚Äù the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.

-
>To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978‚Äì91) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities.",nn36fw,There is no silver short squeeze happening.

* 16,000+ reservations already. More than Tesla had 18 months pre-production
* Revenue streams include leasing automotives, servicing, selling emissions credits, selling insurance (like selling the pickaxe to miners, and selling the diamonds to the mine owners too, absolutely genius - Fisker are insuring cars which they own, because the customer is only leasing it)
* High short interest (20%+), high analyst price targets compared to current share price (100%+) and low valuation compared to peers ($3bn market cap currently)

* Price Targets: $35 by end of year - Previous ATH. $50 start of next year - European and Chinese debut of prototypes. $100 end of 2022 - start of production (SOP). $150+ 2023
* 2025 Price Targets, calculated using projected data: Bear case - $97 a share, Bull case - $519 a share
* Downside in the short term is capped by the large amount of cash on hand - one third of market cap is cash. Long term, is capped by risk factors, which are almost eligible and affect every automotive startup anyway.

## Fisker Automotive

In 2008, Fisker Automotive raised over $90 million from investors including venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. In September 2009, Fisker Automotive was awarded a $528 million loan guarantee by the United States Department of Energy (DOE). The automaker was one of four recipients of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, to encourage the domestic manufacture of electric cars. The funds were to be used to develop the Karma, as well as an affordable family-size plug-in hybrid car. The loan facility was frozen at $192 million in February 2012, after the DOE claimed that Fisker missed its milestones

In December 2011, just as the Fisker Karma was launched, its battery supplier, A123 Systems, recalled all batteries, followed by a second recall in 2012. A123 filed for bankruptcy in October 2012, leaving Fisker Automotive without a battery supplier. After selling approximately 2,000 units, production of the Fisker Karma was suspended in November 2012, in the absence of its battery supplier.

Henrik Fisker resigned as chairman from Fisker Automotive in March 2013, because of disagreements with management about business strategy. Later that year, the company declared voluntary bankruptcy.Fisker raised and spent more than a billion dollars over its lifetime.The heart of Fisker‚Äôs business model was in that early deal with Quantum. The idea was to design a gorgeous car, and have suppliers like Quantum provide the technology because off-the-shelf parts from suppliers would help keep costs down.

But there were problems with this strategy: Sometimes, those parts had to be custom-made to fit the design vision, which resulted in higher prices for Fisker. Other times, parts were delivered late or, worse, faulty, but Fisker was locked in to those supplier relationships. Sources close to Fisker have also said that many of the parts were owned by the suppliers themselves, so Fisker didn‚Äôt own a lot of the internal technology.

The broker that raised funds for Fisker automotive, by selling their private shares, was Advanced Equities.It wasn‚Äôt until December 2011 and into 2012 that the more dubious efforts of Advanced Equities became clearer to Fisker‚Äôs hundreds of investors. The last few hundred million dollars of Advanced Equities‚Äô fund raising for Fisker, starting with the D-1 round, was what brokers call ‚Äúpay to play.‚Äù As Fisker was running into technical, delivery and political problems, its valuation was quickly declining. But the company still needed more money, so the brokers went back to its current investors and said: Unless you give this more, your current shares will be diluted and your preferred stock will be converted to common stock.

It was essentially a gun to their heads. This is why investor Wray sued Fisker in February 2012, alleging he was on the receiving end of this tactic. In his lawsuit, he says Advanced Equities sent him a letter dated Jan. 18, 2012, stating that he needed to decide if he wanted to invest in Fisker‚Äôs next round, and pay around $84,000 by Jan. 27, 2012 ‚Äî a little over a week from receiving the letter. He also says that Advanced Equities assured him that he would have anti-dilution protection. According to the audio clip from Advanced Equities‚Äô internal sales call in early 2010, Advanced Equity leaders say that the Fisker deal will ‚Äúsuffer no dilution,‚Äù and was ‚Äúa dream scenario.‚Äù

That dream would soon end. In September 2012 after Fisker closed on $1.2 billion in funding, the bulk of it organized by Advanced Equities, the SEC charged the broker with misleading investors when it raised money for another company back in 2009 and 2010 (Bloom Energy). Advanced settled, agreeing to pay $1 million, and its co-founders were personally fined. Two months later Advanced Equities closed up shop.

Later, A123 Systems itself went bankrupt, causing more problems for Fisker. Fisker claimed that A123 Systems owed it $140 million, but a bankruptcy settlement reduced that to a paltry $15 million.

Then there was the just plain terrible luck for the ironically named Karma: Super Storm Sandy wiped out 338 of its Karmas in storage in New Jersey. The cars first drowned, and then caught on fire ‚Äî salt water damage caused a short circuit that was spread to other cars by high winds, Fisker said at the time.

With all of this happening in public ‚Äî and in a presidential election year ‚Äî Fisker‚Äôs struggles became highly politicized. The company was mentioned numerous times in presidential debates and speeches leading up to the election. Republican nominee Romney called Fisker and other DOE-supported companies losers.

The company didn‚Äôt seem to invest substantially in technology innovation or tech IP, and seemed to spend a disproportionate amount on suppliers. For example, numerous sources have said that the company paid upfront for 15,000 of some of the parts for its planned 15,000 Karmas. It ended up only selling around 2,000 of the cars. It has also been said that Fisker paid some funds upfront to have BMW make engines for the 100,000 Nina cars it hoped to produce ‚Äî in the end, Fisker didn‚Äôt deliver a single Nina.

Costs to build each Karma also creeped up because the company missed its volume targets, and because engineering had to change designs around supplier constraints. The company ended up adding $20,000 to its initial sale price.

Expensive hires may also have sucked away chunks of Fisker‚Äôs funding: Sources say that Fisker filled the upper levels of the company with seasoned auto executives from Detroit. At the high point of Fisker, the company had around 300 employees, plus dozens of contract staff. Bringing in a certain amount of the old guard could help a car startup ramp up quickly, and also impress potential investors with ‚Äúindustry names.‚Äù But those people are also used to big auto-industry budgets that included extensive travel and salaries ‚Äî that‚Äôs the opposite life of a tech startup.

## Fisker Inc.

In July 2016, Henrik Fisker expressed interest in designing a fully connected electric car with autonomous driving features and an aesthetically pleasing look. He has pursued battery technology, and hinted at potentially reviving the Fisker name with a pure-electric vehicle using technology that nobody else has. Since then Fisker has talked about delays to the promised solid state battery technology, which he does not expect to be able to be produced in volume until at least 2025. Posing risk for competition from more scientifically experienced future solid state battery producers such as Quantumscape.

***Forbes:*** ‚ÄúNow he‚Äôs back‚Äìand three things are different. First and foremost, he has a vital new partner: his wife, cofounder and Fisker Inc. CFO Geeta Gupta-Fisker. Second, his Los Angeles-based company is public this time around, raising more than $1 billion in an October 2020 IPO. And finally, Fisker‚Äôs stock price, up 56% since its debut, has made both Henrik and Geeta billionaires, each worth about $1.1 billion as of Friday‚Äôs market close. The auto industry has seen father-son and sibling leadership teams, but Fisker Inc.‚Äôs CEO-CFO combo is the fast-changing sector‚Äôs first husband and wife power couple.‚Äù

Wealth isn‚Äôt the purpose of the new company, Henrik says. ‚ÄúI never got into cars because of money. (This shows he is willing to do what is in the best interest of the company because he is not motivated by money, unlike 99% of other CEO‚Äôs)

The couple sought a big stake in the new venture to ensure they can control its fate in a way Fisker couldn‚Äôt with his earlier company.

&#x200B;

Henrik is an auto industry celebrity, but Geeta‚Äôs background is equally impressive. A native of India, she holds multiple degrees in science, including a Ph.D. in biotechnology from Cambridge University where she was also a Research Newton Fellow. From there, she started a career in international investment for Lloyds Banking Group, and then managed investments for a high-net-worth client for several years. (In particular, this is insanely important - Geeta **KNOWS MONEY**! She knows how best to keep a company afloat, organize its share structure, provide value to shareholders, etc. because she has worked in the industry before. She may just be the most important element of Fisker Inc., due to the financial experience she has. At every step of the way, she is likely to make decisions with one sole focus - increasing share price and value).

She met her future husband in 2011 when he was visiting London, just before things started going very wrong at Fisker Automotive. They married in 2012.

‚ÄúWhen I left Fisker Automotive, all I had was my car,‚Äù Henrik remembers. ‚ÄúI'm in a different position, mainly because of Geeta. Because she cuts the deals.‚Äù

To get the new venture off the ground, the Fiskers invested the majority of their life savings‚Äìan enormous financial risk given the fate of Henrik‚Äôs prior company. Then, just as they were locking in plans for the IPO back in July, they were hit by a highly unwelcome complication: Geeta learned she had early-stage breast cancer.

‚ÄúShe got the call (from her doctor) during a call with investors,‚Äù Henrik says. Despite that bombshell, she continued working with banks and investors in the weeks that followed, even as she underwent two surgical procedures and radiation therapy. Her medical therapy concluded in November.

Henrik, who marvels at her fortitude throughout the health crisis says, ‚Äúshe only missed something like one day of work...That's just how she is. She works tirelessly.‚Äù

## Fisker Ocean

The Fisker Ocean will have a nearly 300-mile range with an 80 kWh battery and a solar panel roof as a range extender, adding approximately 1,000 free miles of range per year. Advanced electronics will be housed under the hood, and the vehicle will incorporate recycled and sustainable materials throughout. Deliveries of the Ocean are scheduled to begin in 2022.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s87j6bdsfw171.png?width=438&format=png&auto=webp&s=e40add9ce53319d31db242cce73a303afb03cbab

Fisker has also announced a partnership with Electrify America to ensure Fisker Ocean vehicles will integrate seamlessly with Electrify America charging stations when the e-SUV hits the market. With features such as a solar roof and recycled inner materials, it will be, according to Fisker Inc., the ""world's most sustainable vehicle.""

In 2017, Fisker Inc. announced that it had filed patents on flexible solid-state battery designs. Fisker expected the batteries to be produced on a mass scale around 2020. A prototype of the battery debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018. In October 2018, Fisker announced new funding for battery development through Caterpillar Venture Capital. The solid-state batteries are intended to deliver longer vehicle range and faster charging times.

In 2018, Fisker was named to the board of directors of First Cobalt, a North American cobalt refinery that produces battery materials.

In September 2019, it was announced that Fisker Inc. was partnering with Game of Thrones actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who will serve as a partner and sustainability adviser to Fisker, to work on advanced, affordable, electric mobility models.

&#x200B;

[In addition to being a well-known actor, Coster-Waldau is also the United Nations Development Program Goodwill Ambassador for climate change and other social issues.](https://preview.redd.it/3hssff5vfw171.png?width=451&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebe55e2468c5b63d1bc0ac3c71547219dff5afaa)

Nikolaj wrote this piece about Fisker:

To quote a friend of mine who is a lot smarter than me, architect Bjarke Ingels: ‚ÄúThe idea that sustainability needs to sacrifice quality of life is a flawed one. It‚Äôs a design challenge, a challenge to build something that transforms the idea of sustainability into something that will increase the quality of life for all those around it.‚Äù

One person meeting that challenge is Henrik Fisker, who has designed some of the most iconic cars over the past decades for BMW and others, like the BMW Z8, Aston Martin DB9 and Aston Martin V8 Vantage. He‚Äôs a hero for gas-guzzling supercars. He is a fellow Dane, I am a fan, and we met, of all places, on Twitter.

When we met in person, he described his new project ‚Äî an all-electric luxury SUV ‚Äî and asked me if I would help spread the word on his car. The problem as I see it with most electric cars is that they only accomplish the basics. They get you from point A to B. They run electric so you don‚Äôt pollute while driving, but that‚Äôs it. They are basically unattractive combustion engine cars that have a battery thrown into them ‚Äî and for most of them, a battery with a limited range. What Fisker does is to try to make every part of the car in a sustainable and attractive way, like a full-length solar roof, recycled floor mats and vegan leather seats. It looks incredibly cool and inviting, with a great 250- to 300-mile range, and at a cost of just under $40,000, it‚Äôs a luxury car affordable to a mass market.

I said yes and even became an investor, not only because it‚Äôs a great car but more importantly, I hope and believe it can inspire other companies to actively incorporate sustainability goals into all aspects of their business. Fisker then had the idea of calling me ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù adviser. Which I am not. Just to be clear. Thanks Henrik, sounds cool, but I am an actor and a citizen, and that‚Äôs really it.

And what about Hollywood? Is our industry changing, are we at the forefront? Looking at social media, you would think so. And things are happening, but usually only when a camera is pointed at people. Remember a few years back when all awards shows only used EVs for the red carpet? We made a difference. We mattered. We showed the way. So cool. So green, so ‚Ä¶ brief. Now it‚Äôs back to the Escalade. But hey, we are not using plastic straws anymore!

To believe that change will come from Hollywood is not really based in reality (when did that stop us?), but we are great at reacting ‚Äî and things around us are changing, and changing us. I have a good friend who loves his SUV. It‚Äôs not electric. But he cannot give up his car. He is a good guy, he‚Äôs works for the U.N., so if he has a problem going electric, we all do. But if he is presented with an alternative that doesn‚Äôt mean a reduction in his quality of life, something like the Fisker SUV, I think he‚Äôd transition to electric in a heartbeat.

The IPO deal values Fisker Inc at US$2.9 billion, with an IPO share price of $10.

On July 30, 2020, Fisker announced plans for a four-vehicle portfolio by 2025. The Fisker Ocean SUV will be joined by a sports sedan based on their previously announced Fisker Emotion concept, a coupe-like SUV, and a lifestyle pickup truck. All will be electric vehicles.

On October 15, 2020, Fisker Inc announced it would be outsourcing vehicle production of its Fisker Ocean electric SUV to Magna Steyr, to reduce the complexities and costs related to the building and operating its own factory. Magna will start building the Fisker Ocean in Europe in 2022.

## Henrik Fisker Interview quotes:

I have people on Twitter saying, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just make the car next month? You have a prototype.‚Äù Most people don‚Äôt understand that it takes 18 months to do long-lead body tooling for high-volume vehicles. Most people don‚Äôt understand it takes two years to do durability tests and do all the engineering certification and everything else.

And on the business model itself, I believe that there is nobody in the near future or the next couple of years that‚Äôs going to make a million EVs on one model. Today, there‚Äôs nobody doing it. Tesla probably has the highest volume of one single model, a couple hundred thousand. But even the big giant established carmakers are not making, right now, a couple hundred thousand vehicles of one model. So the way you get volume, in my view, is if you partner up with other OEMs and share some of the expensive parts of the platform, which in my view is not anymore something that is unique IP or something that is a unique experience to the customer. An aluminum stamped floor or a steel stamped floor really doesn‚Äôt have any brand value anymore.

And obviously, as we move forward, we always start to do some of the things ourselves. But it was really about de-risking in our first vehicle to market. So we‚Äôre going to do another three vehicles, which we can do because we don‚Äôt have to spend all our money and effort on learning how to manufacture a car, for instance.

So we have programmed a lot. We have hired a head of ESG, environmental and social governance, and he is really spearheading developing specific... we kind of put out some goals that we would like to reach with suppliers, and we at least try to bring them in that direction. They are not reaching those goals right now, but they may reach them later. And then we have goals for ourselves. So for instance, we look at transport. Are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs closer to the plant, or are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs on the other side of the planet that way we have to then transport all that stuff. So those are the types of things that we‚Äôre really thinking about now as we‚Äôre nominating suppliers. And finally, materials as well, looking at sustainable materials. We‚Äôve actually picked up a lot of knowledge on that side as well, where we are adding more sustainable materials to our vehicle. So we are actually looking across everything ‚Äî supply chain, where the suppliers are located, what the suppliers are doing for sustainability, and also then of course in the vehicle itself ‚Äî in terms of the type of materials there.

So - let's summarize - prices are rising at their fastest pace in almost 30 years and incomes just plunged by their most ever! We're gonna need more stimmies!""  

Plus  to above; 

Last year, Hirschman Capital noted that since 1821, 98% of sovereigns that hit 130% debt/GDP have defaulted on their sovereign debt.   

The US hit 130% late last year. 

Simple Conclussion : The Fed can‚Äôt go ‚Äúhawkish‚Äù and raise rates without sending markets ‚Äìand economies‚Äìto their knees; by extension, they now have nothing left to ‚Äúcut‚Äù when the current everything bubble implodes.

And that  is a *real problem*.

 There are only two ways for sovereigns to default: 

Inflation or collapse.    

The latter is not an option. 

 As for a solution, what‚Äôs so tragic is that the only option before the Fed is an even bigger problem‚Äîcurrent and inevitably more inflation. 

 That is, if the Fed wants to keep markets (and their job security) breathing, they no longer have the foregoing template of ‚Äúrate-hike-followed-by-rate-cutting‚Äù at their disposal, which means they now have no choice but to dovishly keep rates near the zero-bound indefinitely.

But the only way to keep rates ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù and nailed to the floor of time is to purchase otherwise unwanted bonds to keep their prices elevated and hence yields and rates repressed.

Such bond ‚Äúaccommodation,‚Äù of course, costs money, and as we already know, the only ‚Äúmoney‚Äù the Fed has to spend is the kind they create out of thin air‚Äì the very kind of money (and policy) which leads to the kind of inflation discussed above‚Äînamely, the brutal kind.

 As for that fake money, the evidence of the Fed‚Äôs desperate (and only) direction is now obvious, as the following M2 money supply makes equally clear. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v774ta55sw171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e73c839beb67a67eea9aed7de4ac61d86813840

 

Fed is so embarrassed by this ‚Äúprinting solution‚Äù that they‚Äôve stopped *weekly* reporting of M2 data, and frankly, since March, have even stopped *monthly* reporting of the same.

That, of course, is both telling as well as disgraceful‚Ä¶ The Fed literally has something to hide, and that never bodes well, does it?

&#x200B;

 The correlation to central bank balance sheet (i.e., money supply) expansion and rising markets is now beyond dispute. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sgizb6xcsw171.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=aad2fe681fe0c49ac20368aba77e86c118b22959

 In short‚Äîdo you see the correlation and pattern? Do you see how the Fed‚Äôs market sausage is made? More importantly, do you now see the Fed‚Äôs self-made conundrum? 

 

Given that the Fed bows to the markets not the people, which choice do you think they‚Äôll make?

In other words, expect more money printing and more yield curve control‚Äîand hence more money creation, more inflation, and by extension more fiat currency debasement.

 More money supply to keep rates monetized simply means more currency debasement and rising inflation.",nn51ou,"""Fed's ""Favorite"" #Inflation Indicator (PCE) Explodes At Fastest Rate Since 1992 As Incomes Crash By Record"""

I have leading indicators telling me that there are two concurrent shifts underway when it comes to who is purchasing homes.

\- Massive increase in unmarried people buying houses alone. This used to be somewhat unusual, now it's becoming very common.

\- Massive increase in unmarried men, in particular, buying houses alone. Traditionally, the female-to-male ratio of unmarried homebuyers was about 5 to 1. For the last 3 months, it's been closer to 50/50.

Source is my own closed real estate purchase transactions. Am a mortgage broker (btw this means cash purchases are ""invisible"" to me). It takes 3-6 months for [HMDA data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Mortgage_Disclosure_Act) to become accessible to journalists and academics, and thus ""visible"" to the general public (assuming journalists deem it worthy of commenting on), but I can see the trends live in real time.

How would one go about placing a bet that in about 3 or 6 months, the media, journalists, academics, etc, will pick up on this, publish articles, and potentially cause a lot of people to buy certain stocks. Which stocks would that be? Is there a ""Mancave, Inc"" out there that would potentially get an uptick? Or maybe a company making smart-home stuff that is particularly suited to renting by the room (the single men are not buying 1 bedroom condos, they are buying proper houses with 3 bedrooms, etc)?

EDIT: oh, and to be clear. It's not just an uptick in single men. It's an uptick in women too, but a massive surge from the men.

What did everyone see three months ago with the initial squeeze?

AMC reached the peak of this little run yesterday. Sell now and lock in your money so you actually GAIN something instead of HOPING you will gain something.

(Some context) purchased 1 day calls options expiring on 5/28: 10 26$ calls 10 27$ calls 10 28$. 
Note this was the retard‚Äôs first option trade so he was going bananas seeing all the fucking ü§ë tendies. The retard was bullish and let the stock run until it got smack down. Instead of rolling the calls and taking a profit he was hopeful and waiting for the stock to bounce back up. After AMC dropped to 31 then to 26 he said fuck it let it run till then end hoping for one last minute run.

More sports betting on the Draftkings sportsbook and the Draftkings Daily fantasy will increase earnings for the company which is almost always good for stock growth.

If the shares are counted by votes which is supposed to happen on 6/2/21, then all the Hedgefunds have to do is not vote, right? How does share voting/count work? 

How will they prove that synthetic shares exist if not many people participate in the count? Is it mandatory?

Non-participation defaults to a vote counted in favor of all management recommendations.  So such a thing would have to be counted.

It is rather a matter of if they are recognized as having voting rights in the first place for such shares. This I don't know because I have no idea what you guys mean when you say ""synthetic shares"". If we mean mixes of options held to mimic share behavior then these do not confer voting rights anyway.

But even if whatever you call ""synthetic shares"" is something else that does confer voting rights, the corporation would have to know that they exist first in order for holders of such shares to be counted by the corporation as voters - because remember there is no such thing as not voting, you vote for management by default or against it, or some combination on specific issues.",,

1673,gztkotl,2021-05-29 00:27:09,t1_gztkotl,t3_nnagy5,wallstreetbets,"Unfortunately, you only have a couple of choices. First, if you like the stock and you feel good about its prospects going forward you can double down on the stock at this point which will reduce your cost basis and allow you to sell the stock at a price which is lower than what your initial cost basis would be if you did nothing. Secondly, you can sell some covered calls in the options market for a strike price at or a little higher than where you bought the stock at earlier. This will allow you to collect a premium for your shares which is yours no matter what happens with the stock price. However, if the price of the stock reaches your selected strike price before expiration the buyer of your covered call has the right to have your stock called away but has to pay you for your stock at this given price. So, in the covered call senerio you will collect a premium for your shares and the price of your stock if it gets called away. Hopefully, this would help you at least break even or maybe even make a little money. Also, if the stock never reaches your strike price before expiration you get to keep the premium paid by the buyer and you can do it all over again. Do this on a high volume day which drives the option price higher. Good luck",,

Many people don‚Äôt even realize we are off the gold standard, if things like gold and silver were stop being manipulated, and shoot up in value, it would expose the true value of the dollar, and people would quickly lose confidence in the economy. This would lead to almost a reverse run on the bank, where everyone start buying whatever stores of value aside from the dollar that they can, as fast as they can. Basically what the smart people and large companies are doing now, but when the masses start doing it things get pretty wild. Most average people are so sleepy that they actually think the dollar *is* backed up by *something*, so when they find out it‚Äôs not, and that it‚Äôs failing, they will certainly panic.

Sure, they are in the business to make money.

Only two brokers were willing to reduce their premiums by $1-$2 per oz. If you've seen the recent /SIN21 chart (Silver June 2021), you'll notice a huge increase in volume in May. From what I gathered, there are lots of ""regular folks"" buying tons of physical silver on the rumors of pending inflation. As we all know, markets move on emotion, news, and what the big funds are doing. I don't know what the big funds are doing. I'm not up-to-date about the silver news. But when I see the average person stocking up on physical silver instead of toilet paper, and during all this time CNBC has attacked anyone who mentioned ""inflation"" or ""correction"", then it's a momentum I can't ignore. I'm not saying silver is ""going to $100"" or whatever. I don't trust big funds. I don't trust the news. However I do notice when average people (like me) suddenly change course and make significant changes to their lives. Physical silver may be all the ""rage"" if even for a few months, but it's definitely a rage right now.

For now short interest has gone up and this is strictly FOMO in my opinion and many others. When hedgies short stocks they have to buy the shares back from sellers to cover their position and pocket the difference. If we don't sell then there are no shares for the hedgies to buy. Eventually with strong volume buying the hedgies sh*t their pants because they have to cover at a much higher price and possibly go bankrupt. High interest for borrowed shares also come into play. Point is buy and hold with money you don't need and shoot for the moon. Good luck fellow ape,,

[When we last left our hero,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrly28/the_legend_of_utheemperorofjenks_aka_ornamental/) he had just lost all of his rent money and what he could advance from credit cards on a failed Super Bowl bet, and a YOLO on ‚ÄúRhodium‚Äù that he ordered from a sketchy Slovakian Wish.com ripoff. Alas, it was, of course, fake, and he was broke and depressed. It might have been the first fatal case of autism. He thought to himself ‚ÄúAm I really that retarded?‚Äù Then, he realized ‚ÄúNo, it must be Oklahoma that‚Äôs retarded!‚Äù

So, [after a brief case of violent diarrhea from Oklahoma Grocery Store sushi](https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/lrslbb/psa_do_not_eat_grocery_store_sushi_right_now/), he was ready to hatch his plan! Uruguay! Yes, Uruguay. [He was going to move to Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lh5igx/c%C3%B3mo_se_puede_llegar_a_melo_desde_montevideo_sin/)

His plans for this move could‚Äôve been anyone‚Äôs guess. One possibility he inquired about was [how to be a Tea Blendmaster.](https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/lfga0m/how_does_one_become_a_blendmaster/) [Another was him possibly reconnecting with God.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/lsij6j/agnostic_jew_seeking_faith_in_god/) Yet, he seemed to be asking questions about another topic more often than the others...

[Bees.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lxcnt1/c%C3%B3mo_es_la_legalidad_de_la_apicultura_informal/)

Specifically, beekeeping, a topic he admitted he had no experience in, [as evident from him looking for any book on the subject as an introduction months before.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/)

What he planned on doing with the bees was anyone‚Äôs guess, and I doubt he thought it through that much either. One post **AFTER** he took possession of 200,000 bees (we‚Äôll get to that later,) was [asking Americans if there was a demand for mead in the states.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/) So, was he thinking of importing Uruguayan honey to the US to be made into mead? Was he going to make it himself? Did he move to another continent for no reason? Let‚Äôs all find out!

A little more than 2 months ago, he finally did it. [He moved to Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/m9ejpn/la_paloma/) And about a week after that, [he was driving a truck filled with 200k bees across his new country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/) Based on replies in that thread, he was aiming to have [a monopoly on beekeeping in the country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/gt48gke/) 

And for a while, things were kind ok for our young Autist. [He picked up his hives without complication.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mtkkf3/about_to_upsize_my_apiary_whats_the_best_layout/) [And then he settled into Melo, Uruguay, and set up his apiary ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/n1jnte/my_humble_apiary_near_melo_uruguay/). Life was good.

But, trouble was afoot. According to a reply, [the species he was planning on keeping had literally never been kept by keepers in Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mtkkf3/about_to_upsize_my_apiary_whats_the_best_layout/gv0viej/) And then, disaster struck. [He went to TIFU to post his tale of spreading an invasive species in an industry he knew nothing about.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/nmd69k/tifu_by_importing_bees_to_uruguay/)

Indeed, he had no idea even what a bee was until he stumbled his way through a book, and then decided to YOLO into honey in Uruguay. He somehow got in touch with an ecology professor in Montevideo that would help him set things up in exchange for grad students fucking with them every now and again. Oh, and the bees were from fucking Myanmar. Handshake agreement, of course. Total Chad move.

And like I said before, the rest went without incident for a while. It would take the bees ‚Äúa year‚Äù to make honey, so he just kinda hung out, stayed busy, and tried to find part time work in a foreign country he arrived in 2.5 months earlier.

And then, the professor ghosted him. Just disappeared. Shortly thereafter, government agents come out about this kid from Oklahoma illegally importing a non-native bee to their country. Apparently his bees had been fucking with other apiaries. So, he did probably the smartest thing he‚Äôs ever done.

He ran.

He fucking ran from the Uruguayan government, took a plane to LAX, and arrived with $14 to his name. His friend sent him $100, which wasn‚Äôt enough to go back to Oklahoma, so he took a $75 flight to Seattle, where he is also not from.

His last post is from a train out of the airport, with $39 to his name. I don‚Äôt know what is in store for him, but I know that $39 is as good as spent on urchin futures or whatever market he‚Äôs going to crash up there.

Also AMC to the moon tomorrow for my FDs I bought!! Don't judge me it's just fun to be in on the action on weeks like this.


So you should think of palantir as basically three companies and they actually are very far from unprofitable. 

They developed the really massive government software (gotham) specifically as a result of an interaction that happened to Peter Thiel while he was at paypal. They were losing millions to foreign scammers at paypal and the solution ended up being a high quality algorithm that flagged the most likely scam transactions and then allowed analysts to efficiently double check and verify the real scam transactions.

 It essentially was using what computers are efficient at (sorting through massive amounts of data) and then combining that with what humans are good at (looking at the more complex nuances that at least at that point computer algorithms were incapable of doing) and augmenting the humans ability to make complex decisions by rapidly sorting through the incoming data and bringing everything good to their attention.

They fixed paypals using this method and literally made the company profitable overnight because of fixing how much they were losing in the scam transactions. The FBI contacted PayPal and Thiel about using that initial software. That was literally his inspiration for what would become Palantir. He goes over it in huge detail in his book zero to one. If you make an audible account you can read it for free and find the chapter I'm talking about.

Then for 15 years they perfected the government software into the absolute nearly monopoly it is now in government intelligence augmentation software. The whole time though they reinvested almost everything for the last 10 years into building the commercial software (Foundry). That side of the business has only been live for a VERY short time and initially they literally didn't spend a single dollar on marketing their first commercial clients sought THEM out because of their insane reputation with the government. Foundry helps with supply chains and all kinds of other important data  insights. But if you want a recent example the NIH and the NHS both used Foundry to figure out how to best distribute the vaccine and vaccine distribution in the US and Britain has far outpaced expectations. You think commercial companies aren't going to be interested in using the software that was literally proven on a level like that?

 They're only just now adding huge amounts of people to their sales teams literally in the last six months which if you read Peter thiels book is insane for the stock because they have this crazy long term plan and he literally talks about how when they get to a certain point and start adding sales as a full sector of the company it means that is the company the company plans to BEGIN scaling. Meaning they're this big and they literally only just started on the scaling part. Which they've also said in tons of interviews if you're a die hard Palantirian like me. 



They actually also have the third side of the  business which is their actual like full AI for weaponization and war and defense for the government. Gotham is like helping analysts and commanders lead and even helping police or agents figure out what's going on. This other software is different. It's called Apollo and its only at the beginning too. It's like pure AI machine learning AI handles everything stuff. Go find a video called pentagon head of NSC briefs public on AI I think it's on the PBS channel on YouTube or some shit. Or you can listen to Joe Biden talk about how we're going to double our percentage of gdp spending on AI. The amount of government money that's going to go into AI as a weapon to compete with China DWARFS peoples expectations of how much large the market for the kind of software palantir makes is. 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201001005334/en/U.S.-Army-Research-Lab-Selects-Palantir-Technologies-Inc.-for-91M-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-Development

This is literally the backbone of everything AI that the government is about to invest in. Sure they're going to experiment with other research but if you do research you'll also find Palantir is the ONLY company that does anything remotely like this software that has anywhere near the kind of clearances like what is required for these contracts. They are currently a clearance level 5 and about to be the highest 6. The closest competitors are almost all a 3 or lower I'm not even sure if there's more than a single 4 and that stuff is crazy hard to get. 

But like again I'm an obsessive. I realize why people get so excited about the commercial side scaling and how it's very possible and can make them huge and it will. But I'm actually pretty sure the reason people like Cathy Wood has such a huge boner for them is that she realizes how MASSIVELY. And I mean MASSIVELY underestimated the amount of government revenue they will get from all this AI investing the United States and NATO are about to do. It's literally the next Manhattan project and they're absolutely going to be one of the biggest players developing it if not the biggest. I think it's funny because most people are pretty disinterested in the government stuff for Palantir but i really think the weaponized AI apollo stuff may be as big as anything could ever be. 




Also people got the insider selling stuff very very wrong. Tom Nash (love him or hate him I don't care) has a few really good recent videos where he explains it in basically full detail what was happening. The selling panicked a lot of retail investors during a time when the buying for growth markets had really slowed because of rate hike due to inflation scares and a ton of retail holders got scared and caused more selling and more people got scared because of that and sold and it really just was mass psychology in effect and a LOT of FUD and confusion. 

Basically a few executives karp in particular got billions of dollars worth of options that vest but literally expire so you have to exercise them which means you buy shares of the company at a strike price. Well because it's the company granting shares the strike price is literally 10 cents or something and these automatically have to vest at quarterly increments. So everytime karp was exercising he's actually buying shares. Like over 150 million in total maybe a lot more million SHARES not dollars. shares. And even those when he exercising he's buying shares technically from the company it ALL counts as profit on taxes and ITS NOT LONG TERM CAP GAINS ELIGIBLE. So over the last year plus this year he's essentially getting shares but the literal dollar value of those shares to the government counts as pure profit. So his total income which he's getting taxed at 40% of is in the BILLIONS yes billions. Because that's a lot to handle people that work for them actually automatically schedule sells of shares to cover the taxes so that there's no issue it's not even like him saying sell today and they do this.... TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INSIDER SELLING TO THE SEC. That's why it's automatically happening so no one can ever claim he's timing it. 

So listen cause here's where it gets important. The exercising of the shares counts as almost pure profits but remember he's receiving SHARES not dollars he doesn't actually get billions of dollars. So has to then sell SOME of the shares so he can pays taxes on that. Then when he sells the shares to pay the taxes for exercising he actually owes even more money if they went up from when he exercised. So everytime he's selling low its actually good for him because it's less ADDITIONAL PROFIT that he would owe taxes on.

 If he wasn't selling its because he thought it would go down even further and then he would actually owe less taxes overall. So if he thought it was going to tank he'd wait and actually get a nice fat discount on his taxes. 

I know this seems really crazy but I promise that's how it works you can look it up in detail but yeah shocking that mainstream media and redditors/youtubers who barely do research and have no real understanding of how these billion dollar compensations work would get it wrong. Unbelievable I know. If he had actually sold the massive overall percentage of his shares that some people claim he did the company would be at like $3-6 dollars not low 20s. Retail got confused because of market pressured due to interest rate fears from inflation and sold low (like retail always does) to institutions.",nmofz4,"Palantir DD if you want to understand company and it's history better (also insider ""selling"" explained in detail)"

What is Blue Apron?


Blue Apron (NYSE: APRN) was the forgotten step child, bad luck Brian, IPO of summer 2017 that priced below range and had the misfortune of debuting after Amazon bought Whole Foods. Since it‚Äôs debut, the stock has suffered dropping from nearly $150 per share (adjusted for a 2019 reverse-split necessitated to stay listed) to as low as approximately $2.00!


Why the Drop?


Management. Fucking. Sucked. The prior executive team essentially handed Chad Hello Fresh the keys to the kingdom, when they made the fatal error of betting that the ‚Äúhigh affinity core users‚Äù would be enough to sustain the business. For this reason, they cut marketing to nearly nothing and attempted to realize operating leverage by shrinking the customer base only to its most prolific buyers.

This was stupid. HelloFresh did the opposite, essentially giving away meals, and they used it to stockpile market share. Put a chart up of HelloFresh customers against Blue Apron. You‚Äôll see the two lines converge and a clear indication that HelloFresh stole most of their business. HelloFresh was one of the best trades of the past 5 years. Look at the chart, look at the sales, and look at the margins. They have managed to achieve operating leverage by employing affordable pricing and emphasizing retention.


Blue Apron Might Go Under....


Today the company is in a dire place. Languishing away in Micro Cap hell at an $80M market cap, no one on Wall Street wants to cover these guys. Only their bankers, CG and MS, write them research and neither are overly optimistic. They‚Äôre in a shit spot with a credit line that mandates they keep $15M cash at all times, and they keep their customer base above 300K (thus far, they‚Äôve struggled). They‚Äôre sitting on $29M and burn enough cash per Q that they might go below that $15M level (wouldn‚Äôt be a first). All signs are negative...


But I Think They Might Win


Blue Apron is under new management. Linda Kozlowski, is the former COO of ETSY and an ex-strategist at Alibaba. She believes HelloFresh did things right and she wants to right the ship. Her ballsy-ass plan is to ride the line on cash and go all in on customer growth. She realizes those customers are worth a lot more than income on the P&L, and that she needs to make the pot as big as she can. Thus far, it‚Äôs worked. Customers are up over 20% in the past two periods and retention rates are rising. We are seeing signs of operating leverage, and it opens a big possibility.


My Prediction

Management is buying shares. They know the company is not healthy. The only logic is that they have a plan that‚Äôs working. You can‚Äôt sell a dying business with a shrinking share, but you can certainly sell a growing community, that could be an accretive asset to a better capitalized entity. I think Linda is going either get the business in a position where it can refinance for better terms, or where it can be sold to create shareholder value via a strategic alternative.

If that happen, given this is priced for bankruptcy and ignored by the Street, the returns could easily reach the triple digits. I‚Äôm long and I plan to add on additional weakness.

Everyone is talking about how the squeeze didn't even happen and the shorts didn't cover yet. What I don't understand is why wouldn't that be possible? If short interest is 17%, so let's round up to about 100M shares. Today the volume traded was 700M shares. Couldn't 100M of those 700M have been the shorts covering? And if they didn't cover, today alone 700M shares were traded, why would 100M shares bought by shorts cause a squeeze if today 700M were traded?

I have been having this question for awhile, since I noticed the same with GME. In the days preceding January 28th (when GME reached its peak), the combined volume was several times the amount of float. How come the squeeze happened and why did it happen? If the volume was so high, couldn't the shorts have covered in the days preceding that?

I hope this makes sense and I really hope someone will be kind enough to explain a fellow retard who only knows about crayons what this all means.

The plan includes creating an online ticketing platform by Great British Railways which might have a huge blow on Trainline revenue. However, this platform does not yet exist and will probably take a couple of years to develop. Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed.

In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales.  Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%.

I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time  for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

2250,,2021-05-28 10:41:01,t3_nmuzzi,,wallstreetbets,"Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent of Modernas if not more. Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects) 

Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

Imagine if the spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize one piece to understand the whole picture it and helps modify your DNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates it can still recognize the virus. In contrast to using one portion of the picture as it mutates it's easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine, that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. Not only that but they have had the least amount of side effects of any covid vaccine deeming it the safest covid vaccine.... 

And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein (whole picture) and the safety profile. Also worth a mention is that you could store it in a regular refrigerator, and let it sit out in room temperature while you're vaccinating people instead of a special ultra low temp freeze needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers, this is a majority of the world. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines so other protein competitors will be far behind and they will have an a moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing they teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine. They will be combining flu and covid vaccine by 2025 for possibly double the price of current covid vaccine.

 They are pretty much de-risked at this point. Yes you could buy other  biotechs that can go up 20x but are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up) that has all successful trials done so far, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment to where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place there are no more glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""

They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. Yesterday at market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. 
 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

Future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract in there ( in the link below in another message). It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 

As far as my position I own some $200 July calls along with about 933 shares. I'm all in baby.  Been in since $4.06, I panicked and sold once during February a couple months during the mini bear market we had and got back in a bit too early so got a wash sale üôà but I'm diamond hands all the way to $800 from here.  LFG I expect to turn that into a cool million in a year's time via shares and options based on the DD provided. Just know this isn't all completely my DD some of this is taken from my good friends at the community Nvax community on Stocktwits. They're one of the most hardcore groups that provides excellent DD and are always willing to help each other a hand if anyone's got questions highly recommend to check it out. So my point is this is information collected over the months that is a group consensus on nvax future price. (Check out next link below this paragraph, it has My positions and an amazing DD chart converting contracts to future price and comparing with competitors. My screen name on stovktwits  is the same on there Johnnyknowsbest. Been on there and here since i started with nvax.

Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. This is huge as the combo is going to differentiate them especially since both flu and covid vaccines are first in class.

# SPY SG:

Looks like low volatility day. Play tight.

Note from SG: ""For todays expiration our models show about 15% SPX /30% SPY gamma expiring, which could allow volatility increase a bit into next week. This in turn may free markets for a push up into that 4250 target (Call Wall) area.""

Gamma Index: decreased to -0.1 (A large negative figure indicates volatility may be high. The range is from 4 to ‚Äì4.)

Vol Trigger: Increased to 419 (Important support and resistance level. (above this level = lower volatility and a more stable stock price.)

Abs Gamma Strike: Unchanged

Gamma Notional: Decreased to $-516 (stock has larger put gamma position. A negative gamma position implies higher volatility in the underlying)

Put Wall Support: Increased to 419 (If Put Wall shifts to a higher strike it could be a bearish indication)

Call Wall Strike: Increased to 425 (When this strike is rolled higher it is generally considered bullish)

Gamma Tilt: Decreased to 0.88	 (when decreasing it‚Äôs a bearish signal.)

Net Delta: Increased to 198k (positive delta position infers options market makers have a net long hedge.)

25d risk reversal: Increased to -0.06 (When the ratio shifts towards 0 it indicates call demand)

1) We look to the PTON CFO's statement found in the latest earnings call transcript, for guidance:
""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior.""
2) Being that we do not have access to a 10-K filing for Q4 fiscal '19, we will access other filings that do in fact reference numbers from fiscal '19...
A) 10-K filing dated 9/11/2020
B) 10-Q filing dated 5/6/2020
3) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $223.3M under Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19)
But, that is TOTAL Revenue; we need to find out what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike sales...
4) To calculate what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike Sales, we can use numbers from neighboring Q3 (i.e. Three Months Ended March 31, 2019)...
A) On page 6 of the 10-Q, you will find Revenue of ""Connected Fitness Products"" (aka Bike Sales) to be $261.6M
B) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $316.7M
C) % of Bike Sales per TOTAL Revenue: $261.6M / $316.7M * 100 = 82.6% {""Connected Fitness Products"" Revenue (aka Bike Sales)}
5) Apply 82.6% to the TOTAL Revenue $223.3M for Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19): $223.3M x 0.826 = $184.45M {Bike Sales for Q4 of fiscal '19}
6) Per the CFO, ""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior."":

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote... By mid-July, we‚Äôll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase precious metals  especially silver amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative 

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

Gold rose over 60% in the 1930s as the prices of stocks and real estate crashed. You could buy an entire block with a one ounce gold coin. Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms.

I must address Cramer's statement because he is obviously trying to add fuel to the short-selling fire: When he says ""we're not going natural gas"" he is clearly making a vague and general statement meant to be interpreted in the worst possible way: ""no one is going to buy or use natural gas."" By now, I hope everyone that is interested in this stock understands that CLNE offers an alternative transportation fuel, thus, the investments made by BP and Chevron, and not revolutionary technology like some EV's (but this is mostly hype meant to catapult EVs to the front. What most people do not realize is that driverless technology and such can be placed in Petro vehicles too). Also, unfortunately, the company has done a terrible marketting job. That's why powerful analysts can get away with making vague and unsupported statements. The fact that Cramer explained the stock's decrease over the last month as being due to widespread dissaproval is misleading, at best. Many people do not yet know about the cleanliness and therapeutic effects RNG has on the climate.

The News...

If you haven't read yet it looks like Federal Cannabis legalization my be around the corner. [Here](https://www.mpp.org/policy/federal/the-more-act/) is the House Bill. Supporters seem on board and like the reforms they have done to the bill including rescheduling cannabis. [Last time](https://mjbizdaily.com/key-us-house-lawmaker-reintroduces-federal-marijuana-legalization-bill/) the bill was introduced it cleared the House.   


Personally I think this gets a lot of support especially from a fiscal point of view. With stimulus stalling and a giant debate going on about how to pay for the stimulus I think cannabis offers the easiest way to collect federal revenue. A simple review of the bill and the fiscal benefits to the Fed's can be read [here](https://www.justtherealnews.com/congress/nadler-blumenauer-lee-jackson-lee-jeffries-velazquez-reintroduce-comprehensive-marijuana-reform-legislation/). The bill states a 5% fed tax. Money coming for uncle Sam, right when questions about paying for stimulus.... Personally I think it adds up, but that's for you to decide. 

Okay so that's the hype...

Let's talk about the tickers listed ($SNDL and $TLRY). 

$SNDL

I'll start with the cheaper YOLO, $SNDL. $SNDL short interest isn't high, but the company did issue convertible notes a while back around .7c if my memory is correct. I'm not saying they won't do it again, but they should be in a good place fiscally for now. Float is high with about 1.6B shares out there. However today's volume at the time of writing is over 415M. That's not bad given such a high float. It's about 200% more than the average volume. 

The options chain on $SNDL has me giddy. With over 200,000 options currently in the money on todays move above $1 there is some high potential here for some interesting action. The put to call ratio is just obnoxiously low at .08 it's screaming upwards betting. If we hold above $1 the potential squeeze up could be amazing.   


It's also broken up on the trend lines and out of the downward channel it was in. The regression channel from the peak squeeze back in Feb just broke out today according to my crayons I have laying around. 

$TLRY

$TLRY was the squeeze of a lifetime if you remember it back in 19'. The ticker was just a money printer with it's low float and stupid hype. Then they proceeded to do, like they all do, and issue debt. Shares tumbled since then falling from $120 --> $5. Ouch bag holders.   


Like all the cannabis stocks the Feb bump pushed $TLRY to above $60 in an amazing move. $TLRY has a lower short interest than $SNDL, but it also has a much lower float at about 300M. Compared to $SNDL the volume here isn't as good, but still remains decently above the avg volume around 36M as of right now. 

If we peep the options chain we also see a crazy low P/C ratio around .11. But we don't have the Open Interest in the chain like $SNDL does unless you roll out to Jun 18. Then we finally get some decent OI.   


Personally I am going with $SNDL. The option's chain looks better, the stock is cheaper, and the short interest is a little better. My advice would be to roll out till at least the Jun 11th $1 strike to not get eaten alive by Theta and IV crush. But WSB does what WSB wants and that's why I love you all.   
Do not go above the $2 strikes IMO. You will get crushed by theta unless we get an insane move, which could happen but I don't see the risk / reward there.",nn326f,MORE ACT / CANNABIS / $SNDL & $TLRY Potential

>A corner in the silver market has been tried before - and let's be clear, that is what is being attempted now.  In 1980, a rule change by the government destroyed the corner.  #silverthursday.

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday

>Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers‚Äô attempt to corner the market on the metal.

-
>Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926‚Äì2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers‚Äô Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.

-
>By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged‚ÄîMarch 27‚Äîsilver fell to $10.80, the metal‚Äôs biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, ‚ÄúA billion dollars isn‚Äôt what it used to be,‚Äù the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.

-
>To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R.

Tl;dr

This is an extensive, in-depth due-diligence document, and I realize that ‚Äúain‚Äôt nobody got time for that‚Äù. So I have decided to do God‚Äôs work for him and put the tl;dr at the start, saving you all a couple hours read.

* Henrik Fisker is a God among men in the automotive industry - trust him to do right
* Geeta Gupta-Fisker is a solid Chief Financial Officer with experience in investment banking - she will ensure the shares are valued right
* Henrik has learned from all the mistakes he made with his previous attempt to create Fisker Automotive, and will certainly do everything in his power to avoid that mess again. He has designed systems into the intricacies of the company to avoid failure - meaning Fisker Inc is guaranteed to succeed
* Henrik Fisker on shorting $FSR - ‚ÄúYou will quickly understand that you stand to lose a lot of money if you show it against Fisker‚Äù
* Production of Fisker Ocean expected to start in November 2022
* 250,000+ units a year expected by 2025
* Partnerships with Foxconn and Magna Steyr, both giants in their respective industries, among others
* Large Fleet market in Europe gaining momentum, and 700+ Fisker reservations in this market alone
* 16,000+ reservations already. More than Tesla had 18 months pre-production
* Revenue streams include leasing automotives, servicing, selling emissions credits, selling insurance (like selling the pickaxe to miners, and selling the diamonds to the mine owners too, absolutely genius - Fisker are insuring cars which they own, because the customer is only leasing it)
* High short interest (20%+), high analyst price targets compared to current share price (100%+) and low valuation compared to peers ($3bn market cap currently)
* Designing the first ever all-electric popemobile - Massive, soon to be historic, event!
* I give $FSR (currently $13 a share) a price target of $100 by end of year 2022, if not sooner
* Price Targets: $35 by end of year - Previous ATH. $50 start of next year - European and Chinese debut of prototypes. $100 end of 2022 - start of production (SOP). $150+ 2023
* 2025 Price Targets, calculated using projected data: Bear case - $97 a share, Bull case - $519 a share
* Downside in the short term is capped by the large amount of cash on hand - one third of market cap is cash. Long term, is capped by risk factors, which are almost eligible and affect every automotive startup anyway.

In 2007, Tesla Motors hired Henrik Fisker to perform initial design work on the Tesla Model S electric sedan, which was introduced in 2012.

Fisker stated in 2018 that, with the growth of car-sharing, ride-hailing, and autonomous shuttles, he believes within 10 years private cars will be used for less than half of what they are currently used for.

&#x200B;

## Fisker Automotive

In 2008, Fisker Automotive raised over $90 million from investors including venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. In September 2009, Fisker Automotive was awarded a $528 million loan guarantee by the United States Department of Energy (DOE). The automaker was one of four recipients of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, to encourage the domestic manufacture of electric cars. The funds were to be used to develop the Karma, as well as an affordable family-size plug-in hybrid car. The loan facility was frozen at $192 million in February 2012, after the DOE claimed that Fisker missed its milestones

In December 2011, just as the Fisker Karma was launched, its battery supplier, A123 Systems, recalled all batteries, followed by a second recall in 2012. A123 filed for bankruptcy in October 2012, leaving Fisker Automotive without a battery supplier. After selling approximately 2,000 units, production of the Fisker Karma was suspended in November 2012, in the absence of its battery supplier.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/59vfj5wa8w171.png?width=511&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1c03d1e1254fea00c195776122de2b26099dd35

Henrik Fisker resigned as chairman from Fisker Automotive in March 2013, because of disagreements with management about business strategy. Later that year, the company declared voluntary bankruptcy.Fisker raised and spent more than a billion dollars over its lifetime.The heart of Fisker‚Äôs business model was in that early deal with Quantum. The idea was to design a gorgeous car, and have suppliers like Quantum provide the technology because off-the-shelf parts from suppliers would help keep costs down.

But there were problems with this strategy: Sometimes, those parts had to be custom-made to fit the design vision, which resulted in higher prices for Fisker. Other times, parts were delivered late or, worse, faulty, but Fisker was locked in to those supplier relationships. Sources close to Fisker have also said that many of the parts were owned by the suppliers themselves, so Fisker didn‚Äôt own a lot of the internal technology.

The broker that raised funds for Fisker automotive, by selling their private shares, was Advanced Equities.It wasn‚Äôt until December 2011 and into 2012 that the more dubious efforts of Advanced Equities became clearer to Fisker‚Äôs hundreds of investors. The last few hundred million dollars of Advanced Equities‚Äô fund raising for Fisker, starting with the D-1 round, was what brokers call ‚Äúpay to play.‚Äù As Fisker was running into technical, delivery and political problems, its valuation was quickly declining. But the company still needed more money, so the brokers went back to its current investors and said: Unless you give this more, your current shares will be diluted and your preferred stock will be converted to common stock.

It was essentially a gun to their heads. This is why investor Wray sued Fisker in February 2012, alleging he was on the receiving end of this tactic. In his lawsuit, he says Advanced Equities sent him a letter dated Jan. 18, 2012, stating that he needed to decide if he wanted to invest in Fisker‚Äôs next round, and pay around $84,000 by Jan. 27, 2012 ‚Äî a little over a week from receiving the letter. He also says that Advanced Equities assured him that he would have anti-dilution protection. According to the audio clip from Advanced Equities‚Äô internal sales call in early 2010, Advanced Equity leaders say that the Fisker deal will ‚Äúsuffer no dilution,‚Äù and was ‚Äúa dream scenario.‚Äù

That dream would soon end. In September 2012 after Fisker closed on $1.2 billion in funding, the bulk of it organized by Advanced Equities, the SEC charged the broker with misleading investors when it raised money for another company back in 2009 and 2010 (Bloom Energy). Advanced settled, agreeing to pay $1 million, and its co-founders were personally fined. Two months later Advanced Equities closed up shop.

Later, A123 Systems itself went bankrupt, causing more problems for Fisker. Fisker claimed that A123 Systems owed it $140 million, but a bankruptcy settlement reduced that to a paltry $15 million.

Then there was the just plain terrible luck for the ironically named Karma: Super Storm Sandy wiped out 338 of its Karmas in storage in New Jersey. The cars first drowned, and then caught on fire ‚Äî salt water damage caused a short circuit that was spread to other cars by high winds, Fisker said at the time.

With all of this happening in public ‚Äî and in a presidential election year ‚Äî Fisker‚Äôs struggles became highly politicized. The company was mentioned numerous times in presidential debates and speeches leading up to the election. Republican nominee Romney called Fisker and other DOE-supported companies losers.

The company didn‚Äôt seem to invest substantially in technology innovation or tech IP, and seemed to spend a disproportionate amount on suppliers. For example, numerous sources have said that the company paid upfront for 15,000 of some of the parts for its planned 15,000 Karmas. It ended up only selling around 2,000 of the cars. It has also been said that Fisker paid some funds upfront to have BMW make engines for the 100,000 Nina cars it hoped to produce ‚Äî in the end, Fisker didn‚Äôt deliver a single Nina.

Costs to build each Karma also creeped up because the company missed its volume targets, and because engineering had to change designs around supplier constraints. The company ended up adding $20,000 to its initial sale price.

Expensive hires may also have sucked away chunks of Fisker‚Äôs funding: Sources say that Fisker filled the upper levels of the company with seasoned auto executives from Detroit. At the high point of Fisker, the company had around 300 employees, plus dozens of contract staff. Bringing in a certain amount of the old guard could help a car startup ramp up quickly, and also impress potential investors with ‚Äúindustry names.‚Äù But those people are also used to big auto-industry budgets that included extensive travel and salaries ‚Äî that‚Äôs the opposite life of a tech startup.

## Fisker Inc.

In July 2016, Henrik Fisker expressed interest in designing a fully connected electric car with autonomous driving features and an aesthetically pleasing look. He has pursued battery technology, and hinted at potentially reviving the Fisker name with a pure-electric vehicle using technology that nobody else has. Since then Fisker has talked about delays to the promised solid state battery technology, which he does not expect to be able to be produced in volume until at least 2025. Posing risk for competition from more scientifically experienced future solid state battery producers such as Quantumscape.

***Forbes:*** ‚ÄúNow he‚Äôs back‚Äìand three things are different. First and foremost, he has a vital new partner: his wife, cofounder and Fisker Inc. CFO Geeta Gupta-Fisker. Second, his Los Angeles-based company is public this time around, raising more than $1 billion in an October 2020 IPO. And finally, Fisker‚Äôs stock price, up 56% since its debut, has made both Henrik and Geeta billionaires, each worth about $1.1 billion as of Friday‚Äôs market close. The auto industry has seen father-son and sibling leadership teams, but Fisker Inc.‚Äôs CEO-CFO combo is the fast-changing sector‚Äôs first husband and wife power couple.‚Äù

Wealth isn‚Äôt the purpose of the new company, Henrik says. ‚ÄúI never got into cars because of money. (This shows he is willing to do what is in the best interest of the company because he is not motivated by money, unlike 99% of other CEO‚Äôs)

The couple sought a big stake in the new venture to ensure they can control its fate in a way Fisker couldn‚Äôt with his earlier company.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yzhded6pfw171.png?width=408&format=png&auto=webp&s=54b30259720cf853a8efeacf058f2f74315260b9

Henrik is an auto industry celebrity, but Geeta‚Äôs background is equally impressive. A native of India, she holds multiple degrees in science, including a Ph.D. in biotechnology from Cambridge University where she was also a Research Newton Fellow. From there, she started a career in international investment for Lloyds Banking Group, and then managed investments for a high-net-worth client for several years. (In particular, this is insanely important - Geeta **KNOWS MONEY**! She knows how best to keep a company afloat, organize its share structure, provide value to shareholders, etc. because she has worked in the industry before. She may just be the most important element of Fisker Inc., due to the financial experience she has. At every step of the way, she is likely to make decisions with one sole focus - increasing share price and value).

She met her future husband in 2011 when he was visiting London, just before things started going very wrong at Fisker Automotive. They married in 2012.

‚ÄúWhen I left Fisker Automotive, all I had was my car,‚Äù Henrik remembers. ‚ÄúI'm in a different position, mainly because of Geeta. Because she cuts the deals.‚Äù

To get the new venture off the ground, the Fiskers invested the majority of their life savings‚Äìan enormous financial risk given the fate of Henrik‚Äôs prior company. Then, just as they were locking in plans for the IPO back in July, they were hit by a highly unwelcome complication: Geeta learned she had early-stage breast cancer.

‚ÄúShe got the call (from her doctor) during a call with investors,‚Äù Henrik says. Despite that bombshell, she continued working with banks and investors in the weeks that followed, even as she underwent two surgical procedures and radiation therapy. Her medical therapy concluded in November.

Henrik, who marvels at her fortitude throughout the health crisis says, ‚Äúshe only missed something like one day of work...That's just how she is. She works tirelessly.‚Äù

## Fisker Ocean

The Fisker Ocean will have a nearly 300-mile range with an 80 kWh battery and a solar panel roof as a range extender, adding approximately 1,000 free miles of range per year. Advanced electronics will be housed under the hood, and the vehicle will incorporate recycled and sustainable materials throughout. Deliveries of the Ocean are scheduled to begin in 2022.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s87j6bdsfw171.png?width=438&format=png&auto=webp&s=e40add9ce53319d31db242cce73a303afb03cbab

Fisker has also announced a partnership with Electrify America to ensure Fisker Ocean vehicles will integrate seamlessly with Electrify America charging stations when the e-SUV hits the market. With features such as a solar roof and recycled inner materials, it will be, according to Fisker Inc., the ""world's most sustainable vehicle.""

In 2017, Fisker Inc. announced that it had filed patents on flexible solid-state battery designs. Fisker expected the batteries to be produced on a mass scale around 2020. A prototype of the battery debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018. In October 2018, Fisker announced new funding for battery development through Caterpillar Venture Capital. The solid-state batteries are intended to deliver longer vehicle range and faster charging times.

In 2018, Fisker was named to the board of directors of First Cobalt, a North American cobalt refinery that produces battery materials.

In September 2019, it was announced that Fisker Inc. was partnering with Game of Thrones actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who will serve as a partner and sustainability adviser to Fisker, to work on advanced, affordable, electric mobility models.

&#x200B;

[In addition to being a well-known actor, Coster-Waldau is also the United Nations Development Program Goodwill Ambassador for climate change and other social issues.](https://preview.redd.it/3hssff5vfw171.png?width=451&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebe55e2468c5b63d1bc0ac3c71547219dff5afaa)

Nikolaj wrote this piece about Fisker:

To quote a friend of mine who is a lot smarter than me, architect Bjarke Ingels: ‚ÄúThe idea that sustainability needs to sacrifice quality of life is a flawed one. It‚Äôs a design challenge, a challenge to build something that transforms the idea of sustainability into something that will increase the quality of life for all those around it.‚Äù

One person meeting that challenge is Henrik Fisker, who has designed some of the most iconic cars over the past decades for BMW and others, like the BMW Z8, Aston Martin DB9 and Aston Martin V8 Vantage. He‚Äôs a hero for gas-guzzling supercars. He is a fellow Dane, I am a fan, and we met, of all places, on Twitter.

When we met in person, he described his new project ‚Äî an all-electric luxury SUV ‚Äî and asked me if I would help spread the word on his car. The problem as I see it with most electric cars is that they only accomplish the basics. They get you from point A to B. They run electric so you don‚Äôt pollute while driving, but that‚Äôs it. They are basically unattractive combustion engine cars that have a battery thrown into them ‚Äî and for most of them, a battery with a limited range. What Fisker does is to try to make every part of the car in a sustainable and attractive way, like a full-length solar roof, recycled floor mats and vegan leather seats. It looks incredibly cool and inviting, with a great 250- to 300-mile range, and at a cost of just under $40,000, it‚Äôs a luxury car affordable to a mass market.

I said yes and even became an investor, not only because it‚Äôs a great car but more importantly, I hope and believe it can inspire other companies to actively incorporate sustainability goals into all aspects of their business. Fisker then had the idea of calling me ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù adviser. Which I am not. Just to be clear. Thanks Henrik, sounds cool, but I am an actor and a citizen, and that‚Äôs really it.

And what about Hollywood? Is our industry changing, are we at the forefront? Looking at social media, you would think so. And things are happening, but usually only when a camera is pointed at people. Remember a few years back when all awards shows only used EVs for the red carpet? We made a difference. We mattered. We showed the way. So cool. So green, so ‚Ä¶ brief. Now it‚Äôs back to the Escalade. But hey, we are not using plastic straws anymore!

To believe that change will come from Hollywood is not really based in reality (when did that stop us?), but we are great at reacting ‚Äî and things around us are changing, and changing us. I have a good friend who loves his SUV. It‚Äôs not electric. But he cannot give up his car. He is a good guy, he‚Äôs works for the U.N., so if he has a problem going electric, we all do. But if he is presented with an alternative that doesn‚Äôt mean a reduction in his quality of life, something like the Fisker SUV, I think he‚Äôd transition to electric in a heartbeat.

The IPO deal values Fisker Inc at US$2.9 billion, with an IPO share price of $10.

On July 30, 2020, Fisker announced plans for a four-vehicle portfolio by 2025. The Fisker Ocean SUV will be joined by a sports sedan based on their previously announced Fisker Emotion concept, a coupe-like SUV, and a lifestyle pickup truck. All will be electric vehicles.

On October 15, 2020, Fisker Inc announced it would be outsourcing vehicle production of its Fisker Ocean electric SUV to Magna Steyr, to reduce the complexities and costs related to the building and operating its own factory. Magna will start building the Fisker Ocean in Europe in 2022.

## Henrik Fisker Interview quotes:

I have people on Twitter saying, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just make the car next month? You have a prototype.‚Äù Most people don‚Äôt understand that it takes 18 months to do long-lead body tooling for high-volume vehicles. Most people don‚Äôt understand it takes two years to do durability tests and do all the engineering certification and everything else.

And on the business model itself, I believe that there is nobody in the near future or the next couple of years that‚Äôs going to make a million EVs on one model. Today, there‚Äôs nobody doing it. Tesla probably has the highest volume of one single model, a couple hundred thousand. But even the big giant established carmakers are not making, right now, a couple hundred thousand vehicles of one model. So the way you get volume, in my view, is if you partner up with other OEMs and share some of the expensive parts of the platform, which in my view is not anymore something that is unique IP or something that is a unique experience to the customer. An aluminum stamped floor or a steel stamped floor really doesn‚Äôt have any brand value anymore.

And obviously, as we move forward, we always start to do some of the things ourselves. But it was really about de-risking in our first vehicle to market. So we‚Äôre going to do another three vehicles, which we can do because we don‚Äôt have to spend all our money and effort on learning how to manufacture a car, for instance.

So we have programmed a lot. We have hired a head of ESG, environmental and social governance, and he is really spearheading developing specific... we kind of put out some goals that we would like to reach with suppliers, and we at least try to bring them in that direction. They are not reaching those goals right now, but they may reach them later. And then we have goals for ourselves. So for instance, we look at transport. Are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs closer to the plant, or are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs on the other side of the planet that way we have to then transport all that stuff. So those are the types of things that we‚Äôre really thinking about now as we‚Äôre nominating suppliers. And finally, materials as well, looking at sustainable materials. We‚Äôve actually picked up a lot of knowledge on that side as well, where we are adding more sustainable materials to our vehicle. So we are actually looking across everything ‚Äî supply chain, where the suppliers are located, what the suppliers are doing for sustainability, and also then of course in the vehicle itself ‚Äî in terms of the type of materials there.

So - let's summarize - prices are rising at their fastest pace in almost 30 years and incomes just plunged by their most ever! We're gonna need more stimmies!""  

Plus  to above; 

Last year, Hirschman Capital noted that since 1821, 98% of sovereigns that hit 130% debt/GDP have defaulted on their sovereign debt.   

The US hit 130% late last year. 

Simple Conclussion : The Fed can‚Äôt go ‚Äúhawkish‚Äù and raise rates without sending markets ‚Äìand economies‚Äìto their knees; by extension, they now have nothing left to ‚Äúcut‚Äù when the current everything bubble implodes.

And that  is a *real problem*.

 There are only two ways for sovereigns to default: 

Inflation or collapse.    

The latter is not an option. 

 As for a solution, what‚Äôs so tragic is that the only option before the Fed is an even bigger problem‚Äîcurrent and inevitably more inflation. 

 That is, if the Fed wants to keep markets (and their job security) breathing, they no longer have the foregoing template of ‚Äúrate-hike-followed-by-rate-cutting‚Äù at their disposal, which means they now have no choice but to dovishly keep rates near the zero-bound indefinitely.

But the only way to keep rates ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù and nailed to the floor of time is to purchase otherwise unwanted bonds to keep their prices elevated and hence yields and rates repressed.

Such bond ‚Äúaccommodation,‚Äù of course, costs money, and as we already know, the only ‚Äúmoney‚Äù the Fed has to spend is the kind they create out of thin air‚Äì the very kind of money (and policy) which leads to the kind of inflation discussed above‚Äînamely, the brutal kind.

 As for that fake money, the evidence of the Fed‚Äôs desperate (and only) direction is now obvious, as the following M2 money supply makes equally clear. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v774ta55sw171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e73c839beb67a67eea9aed7de4ac61d86813840

 

Fed is so embarrassed by this ‚Äúprinting solution‚Äù that they‚Äôve stopped *weekly* reporting of M2 data, and frankly, since March, have even stopped *monthly* reporting of the same.

That, of course, is both telling as well as disgraceful‚Ä¶ The Fed literally has something to hide, and that never bodes well, does it?

&#x200B;

 The correlation to central bank balance sheet (i.e., money supply) expansion and rising markets is now beyond dispute. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sgizb6xcsw171.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=aad2fe681fe0c49ac20368aba77e86c118b22959

 In short‚Äîdo you see the correlation and pattern? Do you see how the Fed‚Äôs market sausage is made? More importantly, do you now see the Fed‚Äôs self-made conundrum? 

 

Given that the Fed bows to the markets not the people, which choice do you think they‚Äôll make?

In other words, expect more money printing and more yield curve control‚Äîand hence more money creation, more inflation, and by extension more fiat currency debasement.

 More money supply to keep rates monetized simply means more currency debasement and rising inflation.",nn51ou,"""Fed's ""Favorite"" #Inflation Indicator (PCE) Explodes At Fastest Rate Since 1992 As Incomes Crash By Record"""

2289,,2021-05-28 20:45:08,t3_nn76we,,wallstreetbets,"TLDR:

I have leading indicators telling me that there are two concurrent shifts underway when it comes to who is purchasing homes.

\- Massive increase in unmarried people buying houses alone. This used to be somewhat unusual, now it's becoming very common.

\- Massive increase in unmarried men, in particular, buying houses alone. Traditionally, the female-to-male ratio of unmarried homebuyers was about 5 to 1. For the last 3 months, it's been closer to 50/50.

Source is my own closed real estate purchase transactions. Am a mortgage broker (btw this means cash purchases are ""invisible"" to me). It takes 3-6 months for [HMDA data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Mortgage_Disclosure_Act) to become accessible to journalists and academics, and thus ""visible"" to the general public (assuming journalists deem it worthy of commenting on), but I can see the trends live in real time.

How would one go about placing a bet that in about 3 or 6 months, the media, journalists, academics, etc, will pick up on this, publish articles, and potentially cause a lot of people to buy certain stocks. Which stocks would that be? Is there a ""Mancave, Inc"" out there that would potentially get an uptick? Or maybe a company making smart-home stuff that is particularly suited to renting by the room (the single men are not buying 1 bedroom condos, they are buying proper houses with 3 bedrooms, etc)?

EDIT: oh, and to be clear. It's not just an uptick in single men. It's an uptick in women too, but a massive surge from the men. It used to be that for 15 banana sales, 10 are to married couples, 4 to single women, and 1 to a single man. Now for the same 15 banana sales, it's 6 to married couples, 6 to single women, and 3 to single men, something like that.",nn76we,Homebuyer Demographics Shift towards single and male. How to bet?

I have been doing research and talking to as many people I can that have some sort of experience/knowledge when dealing with the stock market. I heard about the potential to get into AMC and make some serious profit. I invested early on when shares were selling for around $8.00. I kept reading we need to hold until June 2nd and reevaluate. That‚Äôs my current plan, but hey I don‚Äôt know much about the game lol.

My current understanding of why there is a squeeze is because of previous events which backed hedge funds into a corner. Basically the hedge funds have had to borrow shares to pay off debt to companies like GME. When borrowing those shares, hedge fund companies left themselves vulnerable because they have no more money to borrow to pay off their debt. So if everyone buys stock in AMC and holds it, then the hedge fund companies are forced to pay out. The more people that buy and hold their shares then the higher the shares are worth and over time it will pay a profit. 

Like I said, I‚Äôm new to the game and this is just my current understanding of how the masses can manipulate the stock market. Please comment and enlighten me on another view point or correct my understanding. Let‚Äôs all get rich and work together with the power of knowledge!

Fact 1: 450M shares outstanding according to most sources

Fact 2: 536M shares outstanding according to Seeking Alpha

Speculation based on facts 1 and 2: I've heard from a few sources (speculation only, though) that the 86M discrepancy (536M - 450M) is how much is shorted under the table.  This seems reasonable, as Stonk-O-Tracker has been showing ~50-60% dark pool short percentage since it started reporting it.

Fact 3: Visible short shares increased from 87M yesterday to 95M today

Fact 4: 19.25% to 23% is held short according to various sources

Interpretation of math: 20% of 450M is 90M, which coincides with the visible short positions.  95M + 86M = 181M, 40% of the total 450M.

A short squeeze happens as shorts cover their positions, and since short positions have actually increased then this still isn't the short squeeze.  I do believe we had a gamma squeeze this week (market makers hedging ITM call options), which will aid a ton in triggering a short squeeze.

June 2nd (Wednesday) is the share count where they determine who is and isn't a shareholder.  It's also where they have a huge opportunity to crack down on synthetic shares, but I won't hold my breath that it's the big day.

Opinion only!!!
My prediction is that the real short squeeze will start only when the synthetic shares are forcibly returned (may or may not be next week).  Then, the price will go up even more (may dip between now and then), which will make the cost to borrow astronomical because it's based on share price.  Let's not forget that high volume we've been having decreases the days to cover, which decreases the borrow fee rate, so it may look like the cost to borrow went down significantly when it actually didn't.  This first squeeze will be what causes the legit shorts to also be returned or recalled, triggering a squeeze on top of the squeeze.",nnbog8,"I ate a bucket of crayons at the theater, pic in comments"

You have the ‚Äúright‚Äù to push a single dose of narcotics, but when frequent flier comes in weekly with a script for enough norco to put down a pack of elephants 100 times over for an entire month, the pharmacist makes a judgement call not to fill. Even if it‚Äôs a valid real script, if he fills his, he could lose his licenses (Atleast in California). 

Not only that, my friends cvs is next to a pain management clinic, so they have to constantly check the state database to see if a patient has already received a max allotment.  

Occasionally I have lunch with him and so I go into his cvs. Every single time he‚Äôs been in an argument with one person or another because he refuses to fill a narcotic script. Sometimes it‚Äôs because one was filled last week or other times it‚Äôs because he feels that the script is fake and doesn‚Äôt want to deal with liability.

[When we last left our hero,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrly28/the_legend_of_utheemperorofjenks_aka_ornamental/) he had just lost all of his rent money and what he could advance from credit cards on a failed Super Bowl bet, and a YOLO on ‚ÄúRhodium‚Äù that he ordered from a sketchy Slovakian Wish.com ripoff. Alas, it was, of course, fake, and he was broke and depressed. It might have been the first fatal case of autism. He thought to himself ‚ÄúAm I really that retarded?‚Äù Then, he realized ‚ÄúNo, it must be Oklahoma that‚Äôs retarded!‚Äù

So, [after a brief case of violent diarrhea from Oklahoma Grocery Store sushi](https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/lrslbb/psa_do_not_eat_grocery_store_sushi_right_now/), he was ready to hatch his plan! Uruguay! Yes, Uruguay. [He was going to move to Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lh5igx/c%C3%B3mo_se_puede_llegar_a_melo_desde_montevideo_sin/)

His plans for this move could‚Äôve been anyone‚Äôs guess. One possibility he inquired about was [how to be a Tea Blendmaster.](https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/lfga0m/how_does_one_become_a_blendmaster/) [Another was him possibly reconnecting with God.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/lsij6j/agnostic_jew_seeking_faith_in_god/) Yet, he seemed to be asking questions about another topic more often than the others...

[Bees.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lxcnt1/c%C3%B3mo_es_la_legalidad_de_la_apicultura_informal/)

Specifically, beekeeping, a topic he admitted he had no experience in, [as evident from him looking for any book on the subject as an introduction months before.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/)

What he planned on doing with the bees was anyone‚Äôs guess, and I doubt he thought it through that much either. One post **AFTER** he took possession of 200,000 bees (we‚Äôll get to that later,) was [asking Americans if there was a demand for mead in the states.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/) So, was he thinking of importing Uruguayan honey to the US to be made into mead? Was he going to make it himself? Did he move to another continent for no reason? Let‚Äôs all find out!

A little more than 2 months ago, he finally did it. [He moved to Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/m9ejpn/la_paloma/) And about a week after that, [he was driving a truck filled with 200k bees across his new country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/) Based on replies in that thread, he was aiming to have [a monopoly on beekeeping in the country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/gt48gke/) 

And for a while, things were kind ok for our young Autist. [He picked up his hives without complication.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mtkkf3/about_to_upsize_my_apiary_whats_the_best_layout/) [And then he settled into Melo, Uruguay, and set up his apiary ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/n1jnte/my_humble_apiary_near_melo_uruguay/). Life was good.

But, trouble was afoot. According to a reply, [the species he was planning on keeping had literally never been kept by keepers in Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mtkkf3/about_to_upsize_my_apiary_whats_the_best_layout/gv0viej/) And then, disaster struck. [He went to TIFU to post his tale of spreading an invasive species in an industry he knew nothing about.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/nmd69k/tifu_by_importing_bees_to_uruguay/)

Indeed, he had no idea even what a bee was until he stumbled his way through a book, and then decided to YOLO into honey in Uruguay. He somehow got in touch with an ecology professor in Montevideo that would help him set things up in exchange for grad students fucking with them every now and again. Oh, and the bees were from fucking Myanmar. Handshake agreement, of course. Total Chad move.

And like I said before, the rest went without incident for a while. It would take the bees ‚Äúa year‚Äù to make honey, so he just kinda hung out, stayed busy, and tried to find part time work in a foreign country he arrived in 2.5 months earlier.

And then, the professor ghosted him. Just disappeared. Shortly thereafter, government agents come out about this kid from Oklahoma illegally importing a non-native bee to their country. Apparently his bees had been fucking with other apiaries. So, he did probably the smartest thing he‚Äôs ever done.

He ran.

He fucking ran from the Uruguayan government, took a plane to LAX, and arrived with $14 to his name. His friend sent him $100, which wasn‚Äôt enough to go back to Oklahoma, so he took a $75 flight to Seattle, where he is also not from.

His last post is from a train out of the airport, with $39 to his name. I don‚Äôt know what is in store for him, but I know that $39 is as good as spent on urchin futures or whatever market he‚Äôs going to crash up there.

2601,,2021-05-28 03:12:37,t3_nmofz4,,wallstreetbets,"This started as a comment reply but I thought maybe people would like reading it. I've been researching Palantir since literally late November 2020 and I have nearly my entire portfolio in LEAPS expiring January 2023. So I have continually done more research on them this is just the basics to clear up confusion and help people who don't understand it because it's hard to hear all the hype and stuff. Also AMC to the moon tomorrow for my FDs I bought!! Don't judge me it's just fun to be in on the action on weeks like this.


So you should think of palantir as basically three companies and they actually are very far from unprofitable. 

They developed the really massive government software (gotham) specifically as a result of an interaction that happened to Peter Thiel while he was at paypal. They were losing millions to foreign scammers at paypal and the solution ended up being a high quality algorithm that flagged the most likely scam transactions and then allowed analysts to efficiently double check and verify the real scam transactions.

 It essentially was using what computers are efficient at (sorting through massive amounts of data) and then combining that with what humans are good at (looking at the more complex nuances that at least at that point computer algorithms were incapable of doing) and augmenting the humans ability to make complex decisions by rapidly sorting through the incoming data and bringing everything good to their attention.

They fixed paypals using this method and literally made the company profitable overnight because of fixing how much they were losing in the scam transactions. The FBI contacted PayPal and Thiel about using that initial software. That was literally his inspiration for what would become Palantir. He goes over it in huge detail in his book zero to one. If you make an audible account you can read it for free and find the chapter I'm talking about.

Then for 15 years they perfected the government software into the absolute nearly monopoly it is now in government intelligence augmentation software. The whole time though they reinvested almost everything for the last 10 years into building the commercial software (Foundry). That side of the business has only been live for a VERY short time and initially they literally didn't spend a single dollar on marketing their first commercial clients sought THEM out because of their insane reputation with the government. Foundry helps with supply chains and all kinds of other important data  insights. But if you want a recent example the NIH and the NHS both used Foundry to figure out how to best distribute the vaccine and vaccine distribution in the US and Britain has far outpaced expectations. You think commercial companies aren't going to be interested in using the software that was literally proven on a level like that?

 They're only just now adding huge amounts of people to their sales teams literally in the last six months which if you read Peter thiels book is insane for the stock because they have this crazy long term plan and he literally talks about how when they get to a certain point and start adding sales as a full sector of the company it means that is the company the company plans to BEGIN scaling. Meaning they're this big and they literally only just started on the scaling part. Which they've also said in tons of interviews if you're a die hard Palantirian like me. 



They actually also have the third side of the  business which is their actual like full AI for weaponization and war and defense for the government. Gotham is like helping analysts and commanders lead and even helping police or agents figure out what's going on. This other software is different. It's called Apollo and its only at the beginning too. It's like pure AI machine learning AI handles everything stuff. Go find a video called pentagon head of NSC briefs public on AI I think it's on the PBS channel on YouTube or some shit. Or you can listen to Joe Biden talk about how we're going to double our percentage of gdp spending on AI. The amount of government money that's going to go into AI as a weapon to compete with China DWARFS peoples expectations of how much large the market for the kind of software palantir makes is. 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201001005334/en/U.S.-Army-Research-Lab-Selects-Palantir-Technologies-Inc.-for-91M-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-Development

This is literally the backbone of everything AI that the government is about to invest in. Sure they're going to experiment with other research but if you do research you'll also find Palantir is the ONLY company that does anything remotely like this software that has anywhere near the kind of clearances like what is required for these contracts. They are currently a clearance level 5 and about to be the highest 6. The closest competitors are almost all a 3 or lower I'm not even sure if there's more than a single 4 and that stuff is crazy hard to get. 

But like again I'm an obsessive. I realize why people get so excited about the commercial side scaling and how it's very possible and can make them huge and it will. But I'm actually pretty sure the reason people like Cathy Wood has such a huge boner for them is that she realizes how MASSIVELY. And I mean MASSIVELY underestimated the amount of government revenue they will get from all this AI investing the United States and NATO are about to do. It's literally the next Manhattan project and they're absolutely going to be one of the biggest players developing it if not the biggest. I think it's funny because most people are pretty disinterested in the government stuff for Palantir but i really think the weaponized AI apollo stuff may be as big as anything could ever be. 




Also people got the insider selling stuff very very wrong. Tom Nash (love him or hate him I don't care) has a few really good recent videos where he explains it in basically full detail what was happening. The selling panicked a lot of retail investors during a time when the buying for growth markets had really slowed because of rate hike due to inflation scares and a ton of retail holders got scared and caused more selling and more people got scared because of that and sold and it really just was mass psychology in effect and a LOT of FUD and confusion. 

Basically a few executives karp in particular got billions of dollars worth of options that vest but literally expire so you have to exercise them which means you buy shares of the company at a strike price. Well because it's the company granting shares the strike price is literally 10 cents or something and these automatically have to vest at quarterly increments. So everytime karp was exercising he's actually buying shares. Like over 150 million in total maybe a lot more million SHARES not dollars. shares. And even those when he exercising he's buying shares technically from the company it ALL counts as profit on taxes and ITS NOT LONG TERM CAP GAINS ELIGIBLE. So over the last year plus this year he's essentially getting shares but the literal dollar value of those shares to the government counts as pure profit. So his total income which he's getting taxed at 40% of is in the BILLIONS yes billions. Because that's a lot to handle people that work for them actually automatically schedule sells of shares to cover the taxes so that there's no issue it's not even like him saying sell today and they do this.... TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INSIDER SELLING TO THE SEC. That's why it's automatically happening so no one can ever claim he's timing it. 

So listen cause here's where it gets important. The exercising of the shares counts as almost pure profits but remember he's receiving SHARES not dollars he doesn't actually get billions of dollars. So has to then sell SOME of the shares so he can pays taxes on that. Then when he sells the shares to pay the taxes for exercising he actually owes even more money if they went up from when he exercised. So everytime he's selling low its actually good for him because it's less ADDITIONAL PROFIT that he would owe taxes on.

 If he wasn't selling its because he thought it would go down even further and then he would actually owe less taxes overall. So if he thought it was going to tank he'd wait and actually get a nice fat discount on his taxes. 

I know this seems really crazy but I promise that's how it works you can look it up in detail but yeah shocking that mainstream media and redditors/youtubers who barely do research and have no real understanding of how these billion dollar compensations work would get it wrong. Unbelievable I know. If he had actually sold the massive overall percentage of his shares that some people claim he did the company would be at like $3-6 dollars not low 20s. Retail got confused because of market pressured due to interest rate fears from inflation and sold low (like retail always does) to institutions.",nmofz4,"Palantir DD if you want to understand company and it's history better (also insider ""selling"" explained in detail)"

What is Blue Apron?


Blue Apron (NYSE: APRN) was the forgotten step child, bad luck Brian, IPO of summer 2017 that priced below range and had the misfortune of debuting after Amazon bought Whole Foods. Since it‚Äôs debut, the stock has suffered dropping from nearly $150 per share (adjusted for a 2019 reverse-split necessitated to stay listed) to as low as approximately $2.00!


Why the Drop?


Management. Fucking. Sucked. The prior executive team essentially handed Chad Hello Fresh the keys to the kingdom, when they made the fatal error of betting that the ‚Äúhigh affinity core users‚Äù would be enough to sustain the business. For this reason, they cut marketing to nearly nothing and attempted to realize operating leverage by shrinking the customer base only to its most prolific buyers.

This was stupid. HelloFresh did the opposite, essentially giving away meals, and they used it to stockpile market share. Put a chart up of HelloFresh customers against Blue Apron. You‚Äôll see the two lines converge and a clear indication that HelloFresh stole most of their business. HelloFresh was one of the best trades of the past 5 years. Look at the chart, look at the sales, and look at the margins. They have managed to achieve operating leverage by employing affordable pricing and emphasizing retention.


Blue Apron Might Go Under....


Today the company is in a dire place. Languishing away in Micro Cap hell at an $80M market cap, no one on Wall Street wants to cover these guys. Only their bankers, CG and MS, write them research and neither are overly optimistic. They‚Äôre in a shit spot with a credit line that mandates they keep $15M cash at all times, and they keep their customer base above 300K (thus far, they‚Äôve struggled). They‚Äôre sitting on $29M and burn enough cash per Q that they might go below that $15M level (wouldn‚Äôt be a first). All signs are negative...


But I Think They Might Win


Blue Apron is under new management. Linda Kozlowski, is the former COO of ETSY and an ex-strategist at Alibaba. She believes HelloFresh did things right and she wants to right the ship. Her ballsy-ass plan is to ride the line on cash and go all in on customer growth. She realizes those customers are worth a lot more than income on the P&L, and that she needs to make the pot as big as she can. Thus far, it‚Äôs worked. Customers are up over 20% in the past two periods and retention rates are rising. We are seeing signs of operating leverage, and it opens a big possibility.


My Prediction

Management is buying shares. They know the company is not healthy. The only logic is that they have a plan that‚Äôs working. You can‚Äôt sell a dying business with a shrinking share, but you can certainly sell a growing community, that could be an accretive asset to a better capitalized entity. I think Linda is going either get the business in a position where it can refinance for better terms, or where it can be sold to create shareholder value via a strategic alternative.

If that happen, given this is priced for bankruptcy and ignored by the Street, the returns could easily reach the triple digits. I‚Äôm long and I plan to add on additional weakness.

Everyone is talking about how the squeeze didn't even happen and the shorts didn't cover yet. What I don't understand is why wouldn't that be possible? If short interest is 17%, so let's round up to about 100M shares. Today the volume traded was 700M shares. Couldn't 100M of those 700M have been the shorts covering? And if they didn't cover, today alone 700M shares were traded, why would 100M shares bought by shorts cause a squeeze if today 700M were traded?

I have been having this question for awhile, since I noticed the same with GME. In the days preceding January 28th (when GME reached its peak), the combined volume was several times the amount of float. How come the squeeze happened and why did it happen? If the volume was so high, couldn't the shorts have covered in the days preceding that?

The plan includes creating an online ticketing platform by Great British Railways which might have a huge blow on Trainline revenue. However, this platform does not yet exist and will probably take a couple of years to develop. Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed.

In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales.  Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%.

I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time  for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

2629,,2021-05-28 10:41:01,t3_nmuzzi,,wallstreetbets,"Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent of Modernas if not more. Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects) 

Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

Imagine if the spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize one piece to understand the whole picture it and helps modify your DNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates it can still recognize the virus. In contrast to using one portion of the picture as it mutates it's easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine, that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. Not only that but they have had the least amount of side effects of any covid vaccine deeming it the safest covid vaccine.... 

And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein (whole picture) and the safety profile. Also worth a mention is that you could store it in a regular refrigerator, and let it sit out in room temperature while you're vaccinating people instead of a special ultra low temp freeze needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers, this is a majority of the world. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines so other protein competitors will be far behind and they will have an a moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing they teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine. They will be combining flu and covid vaccine by 2025 for possibly double the price of current covid vaccine.

 They are pretty much de-risked at this point. Yes you could buy other  biotechs that can go up 20x but are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up) that has all successful trials done so far, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment to where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place there are no more glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""

They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. Yesterday at market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. 
 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 

As far as my position I own some $200 July calls along with about 933 shares. I'm all in baby.  Been in since $4.06, I panicked and sold once during February a couple months during the mini bear market we had and got back in a bit too early so got a wash sale üôà but I'm diamond hands all the way to $800 from here.  LFG I expect to turn that into a cool million in a year's time via shares and options based on the DD provided. Just know this isn't all completely my DD some of this is taken from my good friends at the community Nvax community on Stocktwits. They're one of the most hardcore groups that provides excellent DD and are always willing to help each other a hand if anyone's got questions highly recommend to check it out. So my point is this is information collected over the months that is a group consensus on nvax future price. (Check out next link below this paragraph, it has My positions and an amazing DD chart converting contracts to future price and comparing with competitors. My screen name on stovktwits  is the same on there Johnnyknowsbest. Been on there and here since i started with nvax.

Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. This is huge as the combo is going to differentiate them especially since both flu and covid vaccines are first in class.

# SPY SG:

Looks like low volatility day. Play tight.

Note from SG: ""For todays expiration our models show about 15% SPX /30% SPY gamma expiring, which could allow volatility increase a bit into next week. This in turn may free markets for a push up into that 4250 target (Call Wall) area.""

Gamma Index: decreased to -0.1 (A large negative figure indicates volatility may be high. The range is from 4 to ‚Äì4.)

Vol Trigger: Increased to 419 (Important support and resistance level. (above this level = lower volatility and a more stable stock price.)

Abs Gamma Strike: Unchanged

Gamma Notional: Decreased to $-516 (stock has larger put gamma position. A negative gamma position implies higher volatility in the underlying)

Put Wall Support: Increased to 419 (If Put Wall shifts to a higher strike it could be a bearish indication)

Call Wall Strike: Increased to 425 (When this strike is rolled higher it is generally considered bullish)

Gamma Tilt: Decreased to 0.88	 (when decreasing it‚Äôs a bearish signal.)

Net Delta: Increased to 198k (positive delta position infers options market makers have a net long hedge.)

25d risk reversal: Increased to -0.06 (When the ratio shifts towards 0 it indicates call demand)

1) We look to the PTON CFO's statement found in the latest earnings call transcript, for guidance:
""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior.""
2) Being that we do not have access to a 10-K filing for Q4 fiscal '19, we will access other filings that do in fact reference numbers from fiscal '19...
A) 10-K filing dated 9/11/2020
B) 10-Q filing dated 5/6/2020
3) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $223.3M under Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19)
But, that is TOTAL Revenue; we need to find out what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike sales...
4) To calculate what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike Sales, we can use numbers from neighboring Q3 (i.e. Three Months Ended March 31, 2019)...
A) On page 6 of the 10-Q, you will find Revenue of ""Connected Fitness Products"" (aka Bike Sales) to be $261.6M
B) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $316.7M
C) % of Bike Sales per TOTAL Revenue: $261.6M / $316.7M * 100 = 82.6% {""Connected Fitness Products"" Revenue (aka Bike Sales)}
5) Apply 82.6% to the TOTAL Revenue $223.3M for Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19): $223.3M x 0.826 = $184.45M {Bike Sales for Q4 of fiscal '19}
6) Per the CFO, ""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior."":

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote... By mid-July, we‚Äôll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase precious metals  especially silver amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative 

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

Gold rose over 60% in the 1930s as the prices of stocks and real estate crashed. You could buy an entire block with a one ounce gold coin. Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms.

I must address Cramer's statement because he is obviously trying to add fuel to the short-selling fire: When he says ""we're not going natural gas"" he is clearly making a vague and general statement meant to be interpreted in the worst possible way: ""no one is going to buy or use natural gas."" By now, I hope everyone that is interested in this stock understands that CLNE offers an alternative transportation fuel, thus, the investments made by BP and Chevron, and not revolutionary technology like some EV's (but this is mostly hype meant to catapult EVs to the front. What most people do not realize is that driverless technology and such can be placed in Petro vehicles too). Also, unfortunately, the company has done a terrible marketting job. That's why powerful analysts can get away with making vague and unsupported statements. The fact that Cramer explained the stock's decrease over the last month as being due to widespread dissaproval is misleading, at best. Many people do not yet know about the cleanliness and therapeutic effects RNG has on the climate.

The News...

If you haven't read yet it looks like Federal Cannabis legalization my be around the corner. [Here](https://www.mpp.org/policy/federal/the-more-act/) is the House Bill. Supporters seem on board and like the reforms they have done to the bill including rescheduling cannabis. [Last time](https://mjbizdaily.com/key-us-house-lawmaker-reintroduces-federal-marijuana-legalization-bill/) the bill was introduced it cleared the House.   


Personally I think this gets a lot of support especially from a fiscal point of view. With stimulus stalling and a giant debate going on about how to pay for the stimulus I think cannabis offers the easiest way to collect federal revenue. A simple review of the bill and the fiscal benefits to the Fed's can be read [here](https://www.justtherealnews.com/congress/nadler-blumenauer-lee-jackson-lee-jeffries-velazquez-reintroduce-comprehensive-marijuana-reform-legislation/). The bill states a 5% fed tax. Money coming for uncle Sam, right when questions about paying for stimulus.... Personally I think it adds up, but that's for you to decide. 

Okay so that's the hype...

Let's talk about the tickers listed ($SNDL and $TLRY). 

$SNDL

I'll start with the cheaper YOLO, $SNDL. $SNDL short interest isn't high, but the company did issue convertible notes a while back around .7c if my memory is correct. I'm not saying they won't do it again, but they should be in a good place fiscally for now. Float is high with about 1.6B shares out there. However today's volume at the time of writing is over 415M. That's not bad given such a high float. It's about 200% more than the average volume. 

The options chain on $SNDL has me giddy. With over 200,000 options currently in the money on todays move above $1 there is some high potential here for some interesting action. The put to call ratio is just obnoxiously low at .08 it's screaming upwards betting. If we hold above $1 the potential squeeze up could be amazing.   


It's also broken up on the trend lines and out of the downward channel it was in. The regression channel from the peak squeeze back in Feb just broke out today according to my crayons I have laying around. 

$TLRY

$TLRY was the squeeze of a lifetime if you remember it back in 19'. The ticker was just a money printer with it's low float and stupid hype. Then they proceeded to do, like they all do, and issue debt. Shares tumbled since then falling from $120 --> $5. Ouch bag holders.   


Like all the cannabis stocks the Feb bump pushed $TLRY to above $60 in an amazing move. $TLRY has a lower short interest than $SNDL, but it also has a much lower float at about 300M. Compared to $SNDL the volume here isn't as good, but still remains decently above the avg volume around 36M as of right now. 

If we peep the options chain we also see a crazy low P/C ratio around .11. But we don't have the Open Interest in the chain like $SNDL does unless you roll out to Jun 18. Then we finally get some decent OI.   


Personally I am going with $SNDL. The option's chain looks better, the stock is cheaper, and the short interest is a little better. My advice would be to roll out till at least the Jun 11th $1 strike to not get eaten alive by Theta and IV crush. But WSB does what WSB wants and that's why I love you all.   
Do not go above the $2 strikes IMO. You will get crushed by theta unless we get an insane move, which could happen but I don't see the risk / reward there.",nn326f,MORE ACT / CANNABIS / $SNDL & $TLRY Potential

>A corner in the silver market has been tried before - and let's be clear, that is what is being attempted now.  In 1980, a rule change by the government destroyed the corner.  #silverthursday.

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday

>Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers‚Äô attempt to corner the market on the metal.

-
>Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926‚Äì2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers‚Äô Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.

-
>By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged‚ÄîMarch 27‚Äîsilver fell to $10.80, the metal‚Äôs biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, ‚ÄúA billion dollars isn‚Äôt what it used to be,‚Äù the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.

-
>To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978‚Äì91) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities.",nn36fw,There is no silver short squeeze happening.

Tl;dr

This is an extensive, in-depth due-diligence document, and I realize that ‚Äúain‚Äôt nobody got time for that‚Äù. So I have decided to do God‚Äôs work for him and put the tl;dr at the start, saving you all a couple hours read.

* Henrik Fisker is a God among men in the automotive industry - trust him to do right
* Geeta Gupta-Fisker is a solid Chief Financial Officer with experience in investment banking - she will ensure the shares are valued right
* Henrik has learned from all the mistakes he made with his previous attempt to create Fisker Automotive, and will certainly do everything in his power to avoid that mess again. He has designed systems into the intricacies of the company to avoid failure - meaning Fisker Inc is guaranteed to succeed
* Henrik Fisker on shorting $FSR - ‚ÄúYou will quickly understand that you stand to lose a lot of money if you show it against Fisker‚Äù
* Production of Fisker Ocean expected to start in November 2022
* 250,000+ units a year expected by 2025
* Partnerships with Foxconn and Magna Steyr, both giants in their respective industries, among others
* Large Fleet market in Europe gaining momentum, and 700+ Fisker reservations in this market alone
* 16,000+ reservations already. More than Tesla had 18 months pre-production
* Revenue streams include leasing automotives, servicing, selling emissions credits, selling insurance (like selling the pickaxe to miners, and selling the diamonds to the mine owners too, absolutely genius - Fisker are insuring cars which they own, because the customer is only leasing it)
* High short interest (20%+), high analyst price targets compared to current share price (100%+) and low valuation compared to peers ($3bn market cap currently)
* Designing the first ever all-electric popemobile - Massive, soon to be historic, event!
* I give $FSR (currently $13 a share) a price target of $100 by end of year 2022, if not sooner
* Price Targets: $35 by end of year - Previous ATH. $50 start of next year - European and Chinese debut of prototypes. $100 end of 2022 - start of production (SOP). $150+ 2023
* 2025 Price Targets, calculated using projected data: Bear case - $97 a share, Bull case - $519 a share
* Downside in the short term is capped by the large amount of cash on hand - one third of market cap is cash. Long term, is capped by risk factors, which are almost eligible and affect every automotive startup anyway.

In 2007, Tesla Motors hired Henrik Fisker to perform initial design work on the Tesla Model S electric sedan, which was introduced in 2012.

Fisker stated in 2018 that, with the growth of car-sharing, ride-hailing, and autonomous shuttles, he believes within 10 years private cars will be used for less than half of what they are currently used for.

&#x200B;

## Fisker Automotive

In 2008, Fisker Automotive raised over $90 million from investors including venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. In September 2009, Fisker Automotive was awarded a $528 million loan guarantee by the United States Department of Energy (DOE). The automaker was one of four recipients of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, to encourage the domestic manufacture of electric cars. The funds were to be used to develop the Karma, as well as an affordable family-size plug-in hybrid car. The loan facility was frozen at $192 million in February 2012, after the DOE claimed that Fisker missed its milestones

In December 2011, just as the Fisker Karma was launched, its battery supplier, A123 Systems, recalled all batteries, followed by a second recall in 2012. A123 filed for bankruptcy in October 2012, leaving Fisker Automotive without a battery supplier. After selling approximately 2,000 units, production of the Fisker Karma was suspended in November 2012, in the absence of its battery supplier.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/59vfj5wa8w171.png?width=511&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1c03d1e1254fea00c195776122de2b26099dd35

Henrik Fisker resigned as chairman from Fisker Automotive in March 2013, because of disagreements with management about business strategy. Later that year, the company declared voluntary bankruptcy.Fisker raised and spent more than a billion dollars over its lifetime.The heart of Fisker‚Äôs business model was in that early deal with Quantum. The idea was to design a gorgeous car, and have suppliers like Quantum provide the technology because off-the-shelf parts from suppliers would help keep costs down.

But there were problems with this strategy: Sometimes, those parts had to be custom-made to fit the design vision, which resulted in higher prices for Fisker. Other times, parts were delivered late or, worse, faulty, but Fisker was locked in to those supplier relationships. Sources close to Fisker have also said that many of the parts were owned by the suppliers themselves, so Fisker didn‚Äôt own a lot of the internal technology.

The broker that raised funds for Fisker automotive, by selling their private shares, was Advanced Equities.It wasn‚Äôt until December 2011 and into 2012 that the more dubious efforts of Advanced Equities became clearer to Fisker‚Äôs hundreds of investors. The last few hundred million dollars of Advanced Equities‚Äô fund raising for Fisker, starting with the D-1 round, was what brokers call ‚Äúpay to play.‚Äù As Fisker was running into technical, delivery and political problems, its valuation was quickly declining. But the company still needed more money, so the brokers went back to its current investors and said: Unless you give this more, your current shares will be diluted and your preferred stock will be converted to common stock.

It was essentially a gun to their heads. This is why investor Wray sued Fisker in February 2012, alleging he was on the receiving end of this tactic. In his lawsuit, he says Advanced Equities sent him a letter dated Jan. 18, 2012, stating that he needed to decide if he wanted to invest in Fisker‚Äôs next round, and pay around $84,000 by Jan. 27, 2012 ‚Äî a little over a week from receiving the letter. He also says that Advanced Equities assured him that he would have anti-dilution protection. According to the audio clip from Advanced Equities‚Äô internal sales call in early 2010, Advanced Equity leaders say that the Fisker deal will ‚Äúsuffer no dilution,‚Äù and was ‚Äúa dream scenario.‚Äù

That dream would soon end. In September 2012 after Fisker closed on $1.2 billion in funding, the bulk of it organized by Advanced Equities, the SEC charged the broker with misleading investors when it raised money for another company back in 2009 and 2010 (Bloom Energy). Advanced settled, agreeing to pay $1 million, and its co-founders were personally fined. Two months later Advanced Equities closed up shop.

Later, A123 Systems itself went bankrupt, causing more problems for Fisker. Fisker claimed that A123 Systems owed it $140 million, but a bankruptcy settlement reduced that to a paltry $15 million.

Then there was the just plain terrible luck for the ironically named Karma: Super Storm Sandy wiped out 338 of its Karmas in storage in New Jersey. The cars first drowned, and then caught on fire ‚Äî salt water damage caused a short circuit that was spread to other cars by high winds, Fisker said at the time.

With all of this happening in public ‚Äî and in a presidential election year ‚Äî Fisker‚Äôs struggles became highly politicized. The company was mentioned numerous times in presidential debates and speeches leading up to the election. Republican nominee Romney called Fisker and other DOE-supported companies losers.

The company didn‚Äôt seem to invest substantially in technology innovation or tech IP, and seemed to spend a disproportionate amount on suppliers. For example, numerous sources have said that the company paid upfront for 15,000 of some of the parts for its planned 15,000 Karmas. It ended up only selling around 2,000 of the cars. It has also been said that Fisker paid some funds upfront to have BMW make engines for the 100,000 Nina cars it hoped to produce ‚Äî in the end, Fisker didn‚Äôt deliver a single Nina.

Costs to build each Karma also creeped up because the company missed its volume targets, and because engineering had to change designs around supplier constraints. The company ended up adding $20,000 to its initial sale price.

Expensive hires may also have sucked away chunks of Fisker‚Äôs funding: Sources say that Fisker filled the upper levels of the company with seasoned auto executives from Detroit. At the high point of Fisker, the company had around 300 employees, plus dozens of contract staff. Bringing in a certain amount of the old guard could help a car startup ramp up quickly, and also impress potential investors with ‚Äúindustry names.‚Äù But those people are also used to big auto-industry budgets that included extensive travel and salaries ‚Äî that‚Äôs the opposite life of a tech startup.

## Fisker Inc.

In July 2016, Henrik Fisker expressed interest in designing a fully connected electric car with autonomous driving features and an aesthetically pleasing look. He has pursued battery technology, and hinted at potentially reviving the Fisker name with a pure-electric vehicle using technology that nobody else has. Since then Fisker has talked about delays to the promised solid state battery technology, which he does not expect to be able to be produced in volume until at least 2025. Posing risk for competition from more scientifically experienced future solid state battery producers such as Quantumscape.

***Forbes:*** ‚ÄúNow he‚Äôs back‚Äìand three things are different. First and foremost, he has a vital new partner: his wife, cofounder and Fisker Inc. CFO Geeta Gupta-Fisker. Second, his Los Angeles-based company is public this time around, raising more than $1 billion in an October 2020 IPO. And finally, Fisker‚Äôs stock price, up 56% since its debut, has made both Henrik and Geeta billionaires, each worth about $1.1 billion as of Friday‚Äôs market close. The auto industry has seen father-son and sibling leadership teams, but Fisker Inc.‚Äôs CEO-CFO combo is the fast-changing sector‚Äôs first husband and wife power couple.‚Äù

Wealth isn‚Äôt the purpose of the new company, Henrik says. ‚ÄúI never got into cars because of money. (This shows he is willing to do what is in the best interest of the company because he is not motivated by money, unlike 99% of other CEO‚Äôs)

The couple sought a big stake in the new venture to ensure they can control its fate in a way Fisker couldn‚Äôt with his earlier company.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yzhded6pfw171.png?width=408&format=png&auto=webp&s=54b30259720cf853a8efeacf058f2f74315260b9

Henrik is an auto industry celebrity, but Geeta‚Äôs background is equally impressive. A native of India, she holds multiple degrees in science, including a Ph.D. in biotechnology from Cambridge University where she was also a Research Newton Fellow. From there, she started a career in international investment for Lloyds Banking Group, and then managed investments for a high-net-worth client for several years. (In particular, this is insanely important - Geeta **KNOWS MONEY**! She knows how best to keep a company afloat, organize its share structure, provide value to shareholders, etc. because she has worked in the industry before. She may just be the most important element of Fisker Inc., due to the financial experience she has. At every step of the way, she is likely to make decisions with one sole focus - increasing share price and value).

She met her future husband in 2011 when he was visiting London, just before things started going very wrong at Fisker Automotive. They married in 2012.

‚ÄúWhen I left Fisker Automotive, all I had was my car,‚Äù Henrik remembers. ‚ÄúI'm in a different position, mainly because of Geeta. Because she cuts the deals.‚Äù

To get the new venture off the ground, the Fiskers invested the majority of their life savings‚Äìan enormous financial risk given the fate of Henrik‚Äôs prior company. Then, just as they were locking in plans for the IPO back in July, they were hit by a highly unwelcome complication: Geeta learned she had early-stage breast cancer.

‚ÄúShe got the call (from her doctor) during a call with investors,‚Äù Henrik says. Despite that bombshell, she continued working with banks and investors in the weeks that followed, even as she underwent two surgical procedures and radiation therapy. Her medical therapy concluded in November.

Henrik, who marvels at her fortitude throughout the health crisis says, ‚Äúshe only missed something like one day of work...That's just how she is. She works tirelessly.‚Äù

## Fisker Ocean

The Fisker Ocean will have a nearly 300-mile range with an 80 kWh battery and a solar panel roof as a range extender, adding approximately 1,000 free miles of range per year. Advanced electronics will be housed under the hood, and the vehicle will incorporate recycled and sustainable materials throughout. Deliveries of the Ocean are scheduled to begin in 2022.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s87j6bdsfw171.png?width=438&format=png&auto=webp&s=e40add9ce53319d31db242cce73a303afb03cbab

Fisker has also announced a partnership with Electrify America to ensure Fisker Ocean vehicles will integrate seamlessly with Electrify America charging stations when the e-SUV hits the market. With features such as a solar roof and recycled inner materials, it will be, according to Fisker Inc., the ""world's most sustainable vehicle.""

In 2017, Fisker Inc. announced that it had filed patents on flexible solid-state battery designs. Fisker expected the batteries to be produced on a mass scale around 2020. A prototype of the battery debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018. In October 2018, Fisker announced new funding for battery development through Caterpillar Venture Capital. The solid-state batteries are intended to deliver longer vehicle range and faster charging times.

In 2018, Fisker was named to the board of directors of First Cobalt, a North American cobalt refinery that produces battery materials.

In September 2019, it was announced that Fisker Inc. was partnering with Game of Thrones actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who will serve as a partner and sustainability adviser to Fisker, to work on advanced, affordable, electric mobility models.

&#x200B;

[In addition to being a well-known actor, Coster-Waldau is also the United Nations Development Program Goodwill Ambassador for climate change and other social issues.](https://preview.redd.it/3hssff5vfw171.png?width=451&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebe55e2468c5b63d1bc0ac3c71547219dff5afaa)

Nikolaj wrote this piece about Fisker:

To quote a friend of mine who is a lot smarter than me, architect Bjarke Ingels: ‚ÄúThe idea that sustainability needs to sacrifice quality of life is a flawed one. It‚Äôs a design challenge, a challenge to build something that transforms the idea of sustainability into something that will increase the quality of life for all those around it.‚Äù

One person meeting that challenge is Henrik Fisker, who has designed some of the most iconic cars over the past decades for BMW and others, like the BMW Z8, Aston Martin DB9 and Aston Martin V8 Vantage. He‚Äôs a hero for gas-guzzling supercars. He is a fellow Dane, I am a fan, and we met, of all places, on Twitter.

When we met in person, he described his new project ‚Äî an all-electric luxury SUV ‚Äî and asked me if I would help spread the word on his car. The problem as I see it with most electric cars is that they only accomplish the basics. They get you from point A to B. They run electric so you don‚Äôt pollute while driving, but that‚Äôs it. They are basically unattractive combustion engine cars that have a battery thrown into them ‚Äî and for most of them, a battery with a limited range. What Fisker does is to try to make every part of the car in a sustainable and attractive way, like a full-length solar roof, recycled floor mats and vegan leather seats. It looks incredibly cool and inviting, with a great 250- to 300-mile range, and at a cost of just under $40,000, it‚Äôs a luxury car affordable to a mass market.

I said yes and even became an investor, not only because it‚Äôs a great car but more importantly, I hope and believe it can inspire other companies to actively incorporate sustainability goals into all aspects of their business. Fisker then had the idea of calling me ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù adviser. Which I am not. Just to be clear. Thanks Henrik, sounds cool, but I am an actor and a citizen, and that‚Äôs really it.

And what about Hollywood? Is our industry changing, are we at the forefront? Looking at social media, you would think so. And things are happening, but usually only when a camera is pointed at people. Remember a few years back when all awards shows only used EVs for the red carpet? We made a difference. We mattered. We showed the way. So cool. So green, so ‚Ä¶ brief. Now it‚Äôs back to the Escalade. But hey, we are not using plastic straws anymore!

To believe that change will come from Hollywood is not really based in reality (when did that stop us?), but we are great at reacting ‚Äî and things around us are changing, and changing us. I have a good friend who loves his SUV. It‚Äôs not electric. But he cannot give up his car. He is a good guy, he‚Äôs works for the U.N., so if he has a problem going electric, we all do. But if he is presented with an alternative that doesn‚Äôt mean a reduction in his quality of life, something like the Fisker SUV, I think he‚Äôd transition to electric in a heartbeat.

The IPO deal values Fisker Inc at US$2.9 billion, with an IPO share price of $10.

On July 30, 2020, Fisker announced plans for a four-vehicle portfolio by 2025. The Fisker Ocean SUV will be joined by a sports sedan based on their previously announced Fisker Emotion concept, a coupe-like SUV, and a lifestyle pickup truck. All will be electric vehicles.

On October 15, 2020, Fisker Inc announced it would be outsourcing vehicle production of its Fisker Ocean electric SUV to Magna Steyr, to reduce the complexities and costs related to the building and operating its own factory. Magna will start building the Fisker Ocean in Europe in 2022.

## Henrik Fisker Interview quotes:

I have people on Twitter saying, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just make the car next month? You have a prototype.‚Äù Most people don‚Äôt understand that it takes 18 months to do long-lead body tooling for high-volume vehicles. Most people don‚Äôt understand it takes two years to do durability tests and do all the engineering certification and everything else.

And on the business model itself, I believe that there is nobody in the near future or the next couple of years that‚Äôs going to make a million EVs on one model. Today, there‚Äôs nobody doing it. Tesla probably has the highest volume of one single model, a couple hundred thousand. But even the big giant established carmakers are not making, right now, a couple hundred thousand vehicles of one model. So the way you get volume, in my view, is if you partner up with other OEMs and share some of the expensive parts of the platform, which in my view is not anymore something that is unique IP or something that is a unique experience to the customer. An aluminum stamped floor or a steel stamped floor really doesn‚Äôt have any brand value anymore.

And obviously, as we move forward, we always start to do some of the things ourselves. But it was really about de-risking in our first vehicle to market. So we‚Äôre going to do another three vehicles, which we can do because we don‚Äôt have to spend all our money and effort on learning how to manufacture a car, for instance.

So we have programmed a lot. We have hired a head of ESG, environmental and social governance, and he is really spearheading developing specific... we kind of put out some goals that we would like to reach with suppliers, and we at least try to bring them in that direction. They are not reaching those goals right now, but they may reach them later. And then we have goals for ourselves. So for instance, we look at transport. Are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs closer to the plant, or are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs on the other side of the planet that way we have to then transport all that stuff. So those are the types of things that we‚Äôre really thinking about now as we‚Äôre nominating suppliers. And finally, materials as well, looking at sustainable materials. We‚Äôve actually picked up a lot of knowledge on that side as well, where we are adding more sustainable materials to our vehicle. So we are actually looking across everything ‚Äî supply chain, where the suppliers are located, what the suppliers are doing for sustainability, and also then of course in the vehicle itself ‚Äî in terms of the type of materials there.

So - let's summarize - prices are rising at their fastest pace in almost 30 years and incomes just plunged by their most ever! We're gonna need more stimmies!""  

Plus  to above; 

Last year, Hirschman Capital noted that since 1821, 98% of sovereigns that hit 130% debt/GDP have defaulted on their sovereign debt.   

The US hit 130% late last year. 

Simple Conclussion : The Fed can‚Äôt go ‚Äúhawkish‚Äù and raise rates without sending markets ‚Äìand economies‚Äìto their knees; by extension, they now have nothing left to ‚Äúcut‚Äù when the current everything bubble implodes.

And that  is a *real problem*.

 There are only two ways for sovereigns to default: 

Inflation or collapse.    

The latter is not an option. 

 As for a solution, what‚Äôs so tragic is that the only option before the Fed is an even bigger problem‚Äîcurrent and inevitably more inflation. 

 That is, if the Fed wants to keep markets (and their job security) breathing, they no longer have the foregoing template of ‚Äúrate-hike-followed-by-rate-cutting‚Äù at their disposal, which means they now have no choice but to dovishly keep rates near the zero-bound indefinitely.

But the only way to keep rates ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù and nailed to the floor of time is to purchase otherwise unwanted bonds to keep their prices elevated and hence yields and rates repressed.

Such bond ‚Äúaccommodation,‚Äù of course, costs money, and as we already know, the only ‚Äúmoney‚Äù the Fed has to spend is the kind they create out of thin air‚Äì the very kind of money (and policy) which leads to the kind of inflation discussed above‚Äînamely, the brutal kind.

 As for that fake money, the evidence of the Fed‚Äôs desperate (and only) direction is now obvious, as the following M2 money supply makes equally clear. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v774ta55sw171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e73c839beb67a67eea9aed7de4ac61d86813840

 

Fed is so embarrassed by this ‚Äúprinting solution‚Äù that they‚Äôve stopped *weekly* reporting of M2 data, and frankly, since March, have even stopped *monthly* reporting of the same.

That, of course, is both telling as well as disgraceful‚Ä¶ The Fed literally has something to hide, and that never bodes well, does it?

&#x200B;

 The correlation to central bank balance sheet (i.e., money supply) expansion and rising markets is now beyond dispute. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sgizb6xcsw171.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=aad2fe681fe0c49ac20368aba77e86c118b22959

 In short‚Äîdo you see the correlation and pattern? Do you see how the Fed‚Äôs market sausage is made? More importantly, do you now see the Fed‚Äôs self-made conundrum? 

 

Given that the Fed bows to the markets not the people, which choice do you think they‚Äôll make?

In other words, expect more money printing and more yield curve control‚Äîand hence more money creation, more inflation, and by extension more fiat currency debasement.

 More money supply to keep rates monetized simply means more currency debasement and rising inflation.",nn51ou,"""Fed's ""Favorite"" #Inflation Indicator (PCE) Explodes At Fastest Rate Since 1992 As Incomes Crash By Record"""

2668,,2021-05-28 20:45:08,t3_nn76we,,wallstreetbets,"TLDR:

I have leading indicators telling me that there are two concurrent shifts underway when it comes to who is purchasing homes.

\- Massive increase in unmarried people buying houses alone. This used to be somewhat unusual, now it's becoming very common.

\- Massive increase in unmarried men, in particular, buying houses alone. Traditionally, the female-to-male ratio of unmarried homebuyers was about 5 to 1. For the last 3 months, it's been closer to 50/50.

Source is my own closed real estate purchase transactions. Am a mortgage broker (btw this means cash purchases are ""invisible"" to me). It takes 3-6 months for [HMDA data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Mortgage_Disclosure_Act) to become accessible to journalists and academics, and thus ""visible"" to the general public (assuming journalists deem it worthy of commenting on), but I can see the trends live in real time.

How would one go about placing a bet that in about 3 or 6 months, the media, journalists, academics, etc, will pick up on this, publish articles, and potentially cause a lot of people to buy certain stocks. Which stocks would that be? Is there a ""Mancave, Inc"" out there that would potentially get an uptick? Or maybe a company making smart-home stuff that is particularly suited to renting by the room (the single men are not buying 1 bedroom condos, they are buying proper houses with 3 bedrooms, etc)?

EDIT: oh, and to be clear. It's not just an uptick in single men. It's an uptick in women too, but a massive surge from the men. It used to be that for 15 banana sales, 10 are to married couples, 4 to single women, and 1 to a single man. Now for the same 15 banana sales, it's 6 to married couples, 6 to single women, and 3 to single men, something like that.",nn76we,Homebuyer Demographics Shift towards single and male. How to bet?

I have been doing research and talking to as many people I can that have some sort of experience/knowledge when dealing with the stock market. I heard about the potential to get into AMC and make some serious profit. I invested early on when shares were selling for around $8.00. I kept reading we need to hold until June 2nd and reevaluate. That‚Äôs my current plan, but hey I don‚Äôt know much about the game lol.

My current understanding of why there is a squeeze is because of previous events which backed hedge funds into a corner. Basically the hedge funds have had to borrow shares to pay off debt to companies like GME. When borrowing those shares, hedge fund companies left themselves vulnerable because they have no more money to borrow to pay off their debt. So if everyone buys stock in AMC and holds it, then the hedge fund companies are forced to pay out. The more people that buy and hold their shares then the higher the shares are worth and over time it will pay a profit. 

Like I said, I‚Äôm new to the game and this is just my current understanding of how the masses can manipulate the stock market. Please comment and enlighten me on another view point or correct my understanding. Let‚Äôs all get rich and work together with the power of knowledge!

Fact 1: 450M shares outstanding according to most sources

Fact 2: 536M shares outstanding according to Seeking Alpha

Speculation based on facts 1 and 2: I've heard from a few sources (speculation only, though) that the 86M discrepancy (536M - 450M) is how much is shorted under the table.  This seems reasonable, as Stonk-O-Tracker has been showing ~50-60% dark pool short percentage since it started reporting it.

Fact 3: Visible short shares increased from 87M yesterday to 95M today

Fact 4: 19.25% to 23% is held short according to various sources

Interpretation of math: 20% of 450M is 90M, which coincides with the visible short positions.  95M + 86M = 181M, 40% of the total 450M.

A short squeeze happens as shorts cover their positions, and since short positions have actually increased then this still isn't the short squeeze.  I do believe we had a gamma squeeze this week (market makers hedging ITM call options), which will aid a ton in triggering a short squeeze.

June 2nd (Wednesday) is the share count where they determine who is and isn't a shareholder.  It's also where they have a huge opportunity to crack down on synthetic shares, but I won't hold my breath that it's the big day.

Opinion only!!!
My prediction is that the real short squeeze will start only when the synthetic shares are forcibly returned (may or may not be next week).  Then, the price will go up even more (may dip between now and then), which will make the cost to borrow astronomical because it's based on share price.  Let's not forget that high volume we've been having decreases the days to cover, which decreases the borrow fee rate, so it may look like the cost to borrow went down significantly when it actually didn't.  This first squeeze will be what causes the legit shorts to also be returned or recalled, triggering a squeeze on top of the squeeze.",nnbog8,"I ate a bucket of crayons at the theater, pic in comments"

Thank you so much to clutchmaster and other people in discord - even though they are not telling financial advise (due to legal constraints) - they are helping hopeless people in a way to trade properly by live streaming (just don't put expiring today in call options; 30 to 60 days is safer for new call option traders)....  


Let's eat short hedge funds shorts.

If you are reading this: Try to comment on every 'youtuber or journal site - comment section below' (especially if it shows on your search engine algorithm) or trading platform like webull comment section to prevent people that are spreading FUD FOMO resistance limit forcing them to sell AMC/GME/NOK- COMMENT SO NEW TRADERS/INVESTORS COULD READ TO NOT SELL AMC / GME at a loss; and just hold to break 35. 

&#x200B;

\-----------------------------------

note: this is not a financial advise in anyway (legal) -

since there is a chance short hedge funds leveraged through banks just start another market crash due to spreading FUD FOMO; when all governments are just printing money  like there's no tomorrow -reinvesting to companies or bonds - to create jobs and let people work the economy for their favor or for their fat officials or higher-up exec pockets (some humans are corrupt - it's a given)

To new investors without knowledge:  


Don't do call options at first; trade only; wait for weeks/month to do 'options' trading.  


My choice is: $TSLA (Tesla Motors, Inc.) $NOK (Nokia Oyj) $AMC (AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc) $GME (GameStop Corp New) $LMT (Lockheed Martin Corporation) $PLTR (Palantir Technologies Inc.)  $NOK $SNDL $BB  


If you are poor asf, trade in large trading volumes like AMC GME.   
go to marketwatch and thinkorswim is free.

do a real technical analysis EV EBITA, news, sentiment of normal populace vs hedge funds, macroeconomics, life of employees, purpose of a company, assets of a company, revenue, turn-around of revenue after a collapse; not just based of lines or resistance or some measure or some analyst advise - time and time again many analysts they have failed to predict the market (like what they forecasted back with AMZN); if I had money when I was very young and I was exchanged places with my relatives in US = I would have invested a lot in fb amazon google lol (why? because I use it and people here use it - no matter what the analysts say)  


If you have large deposit funds - and want a kind of real safe investment and not lose all of your future retirement life-saving funds within 5-10 years (instead of investing in potentially crashing biotech companies - its needs a bio degree or hard research / excel spread sheets  insider knowledge drugs laws etc. like  [***Martin*** ***Shkreli***](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHBF_enPH722PH722&q=Martin+Shkreli&spell=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjh5P-X0u3wAhWHN5QKHZmEDkAQkeECKAB6BAgBEDE)  \- or VULs or making it inactive in the bank with bad less than 5% annual interest) diversify a part of investment in $TSLA $AMZN (Amazon) $GOOG (Alphabet) $FB (Facebook) $MSFT (Microsoft)  \[known as the top stable companies in this era - TFAANGM\] (just read the news from time to time incase some executive/s insiders really did an illegal boo boo; making all investors or insiders sell the stock to plummet for no reason at all; but hold still unless it's really the end of the company - which is unlikely)  


$LMT $PLTR and other defense stocks are a very long run investment or a scenario-turn  based investment; I'm seeing some Filipinos and Asians investing in stocks that expect a fast return or up (don't expect or get mad or question it - if it drops a lot - since employees / execs are taking shares stocks part of their salary + R&D) 

&#x200B;

P.S.:   
I'm currently at a loss negative with AMC and GME by stupidly buying at the top; and not having a day trade, but I will always hold and trust r/wallstreetbets users that are holding and did technical analysis and DD.

I was about to commit su1cide (like Bizonacci?) did - knowing I just got cr8pto scammed and due to being just exploited by Fortune 500 related company knowing that their pay isn't well even though they're a top company. But, thanks to wallstreetbets you technically saved 6 lives including mine :).  


to mods: Never mind my bad karma, I was dealing with subreddit pertaining to nembutal and as such back then... you'll understand... anyways I'm not happy with my life and have found a way to cope, thanks to you guys.",nnbwrs,AMC to 50; GME to 300 by end of 2022 :) Pick up the phone and call your friends relatives classmates; sign up for trading to this stocks. especially those who are only having small spare money left unemployed and almost out of hope or purpose in life. Thank you r/wallstreetbets. Thanks to discord VC

Consider X number of shares permanently locked up. X number of shares that will never be sold. 

Sure they factor into the market cap, but when it comes to actually determining the price, they're out of the equation. You need far less money to move what is still in play.

I get what you're saying but having an insane % of the float locked up is for sure a driver of volatility.",,

Everyone is talking about how the squeeze didn't even happen and the shorts didn't cover yet. What I don't understand is why wouldn't that be possible? If short interest is 17%, so let's round up to about 100M shares. Today the volume traded was 700M shares. Couldn't 100M of those 700M have been the shorts covering? And if they didn't cover, today alone 700M shares were traded, why would 100M shares bought by shorts cause a squeeze if today 700M were traded?

I have been having this question for awhile, since I noticed the same with GME. In the days preceding January 28th (when GME reached its peak), the combined volume was several times the amount of float. How come the squeeze happened and why did it happen? If the volume was so high, couldn't the shorts have covered in the days preceding that?

I hope this makes sense and I really hope someone will be kind enough to explain a fellow retard who only knows about crayons what this all means.

Everything looked to have gone off successfully. We are now waiting on the data and craft to be analysed and inspected. This will take a few weeks according to Michael Colglazier.
That being said he had already outlined the test schedule in the earnings zoom call.

1st test flight - may 
2nd crewed flight - June 
3rd flight with R Branson on board late June/July 

4th flight this will be taking the Italian airforce on a training mission (600k a seat) late July


On the run in to the first test flight some possible maintenance issues appeared with the carrier plane White knight 2‚Ä¶. 
This indeed could have gone either way , after 2 weeks inspections it was decided that WK2 did not need to delay testing no maintenance was needed at this point. Scheduled Maintenance will commence in the fall after all tests have been completed.
Upon this news it is my opinion that the testing programme will go ahead as planned.

The market has responded accordingly and the stock is now up from $17-‚Ç¨31

With all these catalysts lined up before the end of the year and commercial operations looming for early 2022 things are looking up for Virgin Galactic.The success of the last test flight the company have now proven tech and concept.

I had a look at $BB and assume that we finally formed the bottom. In the last few days we saw a sharp rise which might continue in the next weeks. If we can break the 12$ resistance, the next targets would be aroung 25-28$. 

Using Elliot wave theory we are probably at the end of the correction wave 4 and now began with the bullish wave 5.

Price targets:

3065,,2021-05-28 09:17:32,t3_nmtt43,,wallstreetbets,"Trainline has taken a huge dip since the UK government's announcement of the plan to nationalise the railway network. The plan includes creating an online ticketing platform by Great British Railways which might have a huge blow on Trainline revenue. However, this platform does not yet exist and will probably take a couple of years to develop. Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed.

In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales.  Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%.

I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time  for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

3070,,2021-05-28 10:41:01,t3_nmuzzi,,wallstreetbets,"Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent of Modernas if not more. Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects) 

Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

Imagine if the spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize one piece to understand the whole picture it and helps modify your DNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates it can still recognize the virus. In contrast to using one portion of the picture as it mutates it's easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine, that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. Not only that but they have had the least amount of side effects of any covid vaccine deeming it the safest covid vaccine.... 

And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein (whole picture) and the safety profile. Also worth a mention is that you could store it in a regular refrigerator, and let it sit out in room temperature while you're vaccinating people instead of a special ultra low temp freeze needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers, this is a majority of the world. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines so other protein competitors will be far behind and they will have an a moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing they teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine. They will be combining flu and covid vaccine by 2025 for possibly double the price of current covid vaccine.

 They are pretty much de-risked at this point. Yes you could buy other  biotechs that can go up 20x but are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up) that has all successful trials done so far, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment to where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place there are no more glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""

They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. Yesterday at market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. 
 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

Future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract in there ( in the link below in another message). It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 

As far as my position I own some $200 July calls along with about 933 shares. I'm all in baby.  Been in since $4.06, I panicked and sold once during February a couple months during the mini bear market we had and got back in a bit too early so got a wash sale üôà but I'm diamond hands all the way to $800 from here.  LFG I expect to turn that into a cool million in a year's time via shares and options based on the DD provided. Just know this isn't all completely my DD some of this is taken from my good friends at the community Nvax community on Stocktwits. They're one of the most hardcore groups that provides excellent DD and are always willing to help each other a hand if anyone's got questions highly recommend to check it out. So my point is this is information collected over the months that is a group consensus on nvax future price. (Check out next link below this paragraph, it has My positions and an amazing DD chart converting contracts to future price and comparing with competitors. My screen name on stovktwits  is the same on there Johnnyknowsbest. Been on there and here since i started with nvax.

Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. This is huge as the combo is going to differentiate them especially since both flu and covid vaccines are first in class.

# SPY SG:

Looks like low volatility day. Play tight.

Note from SG: ""For todays expiration our models show about 15% SPX /30% SPY gamma expiring, which could allow volatility increase a bit into next week. This in turn may free markets for a push up into that 4250 target (Call Wall) area.""

Gamma Index: decreased to -0.1 (A large negative figure indicates volatility may be high. The range is from 4 to ‚Äì4.)

Vol Trigger: Increased to 419 (Important support and resistance level. (above this level = lower volatility and a more stable stock price.)

Abs Gamma Strike: Unchanged

Gamma Notional: Decreased to $-516 (stock has larger put gamma position. A negative gamma position implies higher volatility in the underlying)

Put Wall Support: Increased to 419 (If Put Wall shifts to a higher strike it could be a bearish indication)

Call Wall Strike: Increased to 425 (When this strike is rolled higher it is generally considered bullish)

Gamma Tilt: Decreased to 0.88	 (when decreasing it‚Äôs a bearish signal.)

Net Delta: Increased to 198k (positive delta position infers options market makers have a net long hedge.)

25d risk reversal: Increased to -0.06 (When the ratio shifts towards 0 it indicates call demand)

1) We look to the PTON CFO's statement found in the latest earnings call transcript, for guidance:
""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior.""
2) Being that we do not have access to a 10-K filing for Q4 fiscal '19, we will access other filings that do in fact reference numbers from fiscal '19...
A) 10-K filing dated 9/11/2020
B) 10-Q filing dated 5/6/2020
3) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $223.3M under Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19)
But, that is TOTAL Revenue; we need to find out what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike sales...
4) To calculate what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike Sales, we can use numbers from neighboring Q3 (i.e. Three Months Ended March 31, 2019)...
A) On page 6 of the 10-Q, you will find Revenue of ""Connected Fitness Products"" (aka Bike Sales) to be $261.6M
B) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $316.7M
C) % of Bike Sales per TOTAL Revenue: $261.6M / $316.7M * 100 = 82.6% {""Connected Fitness Products"" Revenue (aka Bike Sales)}
5) Apply 82.6% to the TOTAL Revenue $223.3M for Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19): $223.3M x 0.826 = $184.45M {Bike Sales for Q4 of fiscal '19}
6) Per the CFO, ""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior."":

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote... By mid-July, we‚Äôll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase precious metals  especially silver amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative 

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

Gold rose over 60% in the 1930s as the prices of stocks and real estate crashed. You could buy an entire block with a one ounce gold coin. Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms.

I must address Cramer's statement because he is obviously trying to add fuel to the short-selling fire: When he says ""we're not going natural gas"" he is clearly making a vague and general statement meant to be interpreted in the worst possible way: ""no one is going to buy or use natural gas."" By now, I hope everyone that is interested in this stock understands that CLNE offers an alternative transportation fuel, thus, the investments made by BP and Chevron, and not revolutionary technology like some EV's (but this is mostly hype meant to catapult EVs to the front. What most people do not realize is that driverless technology and such can be placed in Petro vehicles too). Also, unfortunately, the company has done a terrible marketting job. That's why powerful analysts can get away with making vague and unsupported statements. The fact that Cramer explained the stock's decrease over the last month as being due to widespread dissaproval is misleading, at best. Many people do not yet know about the cleanliness and therapeutic effects RNG has on the climate.

The News...

If you haven't read yet it looks like Federal Cannabis legalization my be around the corner. [Here](https://www.mpp.org/policy/federal/the-more-act/) is the House Bill. Supporters seem on board and like the reforms they have done to the bill including rescheduling cannabis. [Last time](https://mjbizdaily.com/key-us-house-lawmaker-reintroduces-federal-marijuana-legalization-bill/) the bill was introduced it cleared the House.   


Personally I think this gets a lot of support especially from a fiscal point of view. With stimulus stalling and a giant debate going on about how to pay for the stimulus I think cannabis offers the easiest way to collect federal revenue. A simple review of the bill and the fiscal benefits to the Fed's can be read [here](https://www.justtherealnews.com/congress/nadler-blumenauer-lee-jackson-lee-jeffries-velazquez-reintroduce-comprehensive-marijuana-reform-legislation/). The bill states a 5% fed tax. Money coming for uncle Sam, right when questions about paying for stimulus.... Personally I think it adds up, but that's for you to decide. 

Okay so that's the hype...

Let's talk about the tickers listed ($SNDL and $TLRY). 

$SNDL

I'll start with the cheaper YOLO, $SNDL. $SNDL short interest isn't high, but the company did issue convertible notes a while back around .7c if my memory is correct. I'm not saying they won't do it again, but they should be in a good place fiscally for now. Float is high with about 1.6B shares out there. However today's volume at the time of writing is over 415M. That's not bad given such a high float. It's about 200% more than the average volume. 

The options chain on $SNDL has me giddy. With over 200,000 options currently in the money on todays move above $1 there is some high potential here for some interesting action. The put to call ratio is just obnoxiously low at .08 it's screaming upwards betting. If we hold above $1 the potential squeeze up could be amazing.   


It's also broken up on the trend lines and out of the downward channel it was in. The regression channel from the peak squeeze back in Feb just broke out today according to my crayons I have laying around. 

$TLRY

$TLRY was the squeeze of a lifetime if you remember it back in 19'. The ticker was just a money printer with it's low float and stupid hype. Then they proceeded to do, like they all do, and issue debt. Shares tumbled since then falling from $120 --> $5. Ouch bag holders.   


Like all the cannabis stocks the Feb bump pushed $TLRY to above $60 in an amazing move. $TLRY has a lower short interest than $SNDL, but it also has a much lower float at about 300M. Compared to $SNDL the volume here isn't as good, but still remains decently above the avg volume around 36M as of right now. 

If we peep the options chain we also see a crazy low P/C ratio around .11. But we don't have the Open Interest in the chain like $SNDL does unless you roll out to Jun 18. Then we finally get some decent OI.   


Personally I am going with $SNDL. The option's chain looks better, the stock is cheaper, and the short interest is a little better. My advice would be to roll out till at least the Jun 11th $1 strike to not get eaten alive by Theta and IV crush. But WSB does what WSB wants and that's why I love you all.   
Do not go above the $2 strikes IMO. You will get crushed by theta unless we get an insane move, which could happen but I don't see the risk / reward there.",nn326f,MORE ACT / CANNABIS / $SNDL & $TLRY Potential

>A corner in the silver market has been tried before - and let's be clear, that is what is being attempted now.  In 1980, a rule change by the government destroyed the corner.  #silverthursday.

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday

>Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers‚Äô attempt to corner the market on the metal.

-
>Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926‚Äì2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers‚Äô Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.

-
>By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver.

Tl;dr

This is an extensive, in-depth due-diligence document, and I realize that ‚Äúain‚Äôt nobody got time for that‚Äù. So I have decided to do God‚Äôs work for him and put the tl;dr at the start, saving you all a couple hours read.

* Henrik Fisker is a God among men in the automotive industry - trust him to do right
* Geeta Gupta-Fisker is a solid Chief Financial Officer with experience in investment banking - she will ensure the shares are valued right
* Henrik has learned from all the mistakes he made with his previous attempt to create Fisker Automotive, and will certainly do everything in his power to avoid that mess again. He has designed systems into the intricacies of the company to avoid failure - meaning Fisker Inc is guaranteed to succeed
* Henrik Fisker on shorting $FSR - ‚ÄúYou will quickly understand that you stand to lose a lot of money if you show it against Fisker‚Äù
* Production of Fisker Ocean expected to start in November 2022
* 250,000+ units a year expected by 2025
* Partnerships with Foxconn and Magna Steyr, both giants in their respective industries, among others
* Large Fleet market in Europe gaining momentum, and 700+ Fisker reservations in this market alone
* 16,000+ reservations already. More than Tesla had 18 months pre-production
* Revenue streams include leasing automotives, servicing, selling emissions credits, selling insurance (like selling the pickaxe to miners, and selling the diamonds to the mine owners too, absolutely genius - Fisker are insuring cars which they own, because the customer is only leasing it)
* High short interest (20%+), high analyst price targets compared to current share price (100%+) and low valuation compared to peers ($3bn market cap currently)
* Designing the first ever all-electric popemobile - Massive, soon to be historic, event!
* I give $FSR (currently $13 a share) a price target of $100 by end of year 2022, if not sooner
* Price Targets: $35 by end of year - Previous ATH. $50 start of next year - European and Chinese debut of prototypes. $100 end of 2022 - start of production (SOP). $150+ 2023
* 2025 Price Targets, calculated using projected data: Bear case - $97 a share, Bull case - $519 a share
* Downside in the short term is capped by the large amount of cash on hand - one third of market cap is cash. Long term, is capped by risk factors, which are almost eligible and affect every automotive startup anyway.

In 2007, Tesla Motors hired Henrik Fisker to perform initial design work on the Tesla Model S electric sedan, which was introduced in 2012.

Fisker stated in 2018 that, with the growth of car-sharing, ride-hailing, and autonomous shuttles, he believes within 10 years private cars will be used for less than half of what they are currently used for.

&#x200B;

## Fisker Automotive

In 2008, Fisker Automotive raised over $90 million from investors including venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. In September 2009, Fisker Automotive was awarded a $528 million loan guarantee by the United States Department of Energy (DOE). The automaker was one of four recipients of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, to encourage the domestic manufacture of electric cars. The funds were to be used to develop the Karma, as well as an affordable family-size plug-in hybrid car. The loan facility was frozen at $192 million in February 2012, after the DOE claimed that Fisker missed its milestones

In December 2011, just as the Fisker Karma was launched, its battery supplier, A123 Systems, recalled all batteries, followed by a second recall in 2012. A123 filed for bankruptcy in October 2012, leaving Fisker Automotive without a battery supplier. After selling approximately 2,000 units, production of the Fisker Karma was suspended in November 2012, in the absence of its battery supplier.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/59vfj5wa8w171.png?width=511&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1c03d1e1254fea00c195776122de2b26099dd35

Henrik Fisker resigned as chairman from Fisker Automotive in March 2013, because of disagreements with management about business strategy. Later that year, the company declared voluntary bankruptcy.Fisker raised and spent more than a billion dollars over its lifetime.The heart of Fisker‚Äôs business model was in that early deal with Quantum. The idea was to design a gorgeous car, and have suppliers like Quantum provide the technology because off-the-shelf parts from suppliers would help keep costs down.

But there were problems with this strategy: Sometimes, those parts had to be custom-made to fit the design vision, which resulted in higher prices for Fisker. Other times, parts were delivered late or, worse, faulty, but Fisker was locked in to those supplier relationships. Sources close to Fisker have also said that many of the parts were owned by the suppliers themselves, so Fisker didn‚Äôt own a lot of the internal technology.

The broker that raised funds for Fisker automotive, by selling their private shares, was Advanced Equities.It wasn‚Äôt until December 2011 and into 2012 that the more dubious efforts of Advanced Equities became clearer to Fisker‚Äôs hundreds of investors. The last few hundred million dollars of Advanced Equities‚Äô fund raising for Fisker, starting with the D-1 round, was what brokers call ‚Äúpay to play.‚Äù As Fisker was running into technical, delivery and political problems, its valuation was quickly declining. But the company still needed more money, so the brokers went back to its current investors and said: Unless you give this more, your current shares will be diluted and your preferred stock will be converted to common stock.

It was essentially a gun to their heads. This is why investor Wray sued Fisker in February 2012, alleging he was on the receiving end of this tactic. In his lawsuit, he says Advanced Equities sent him a letter dated Jan. 18, 2012, stating that he needed to decide if he wanted to invest in Fisker‚Äôs next round, and pay around $84,000 by Jan. 27, 2012 ‚Äî a little over a week from receiving the letter. He also says that Advanced Equities assured him that he would have anti-dilution protection. According to the audio clip from Advanced Equities‚Äô internal sales call in early 2010, Advanced Equity leaders say that the Fisker deal will ‚Äúsuffer no dilution,‚Äù and was ‚Äúa dream scenario.‚Äù

That dream would soon end. In September 2012 after Fisker closed on $1.2 billion in funding, the bulk of it organized by Advanced Equities, the SEC charged the broker with misleading investors when it raised money for another company back in 2009 and 2010 (Bloom Energy). Advanced settled, agreeing to pay $1 million, and its co-founders were personally fined. Two months later Advanced Equities closed up shop.

Later, A123 Systems itself went bankrupt, causing more problems for Fisker. Fisker claimed that A123 Systems owed it $140 million, but a bankruptcy settlement reduced that to a paltry $15 million.

Then there was the just plain terrible luck for the ironically named Karma: Super Storm Sandy wiped out 338 of its Karmas in storage in New Jersey. The cars first drowned, and then caught on fire ‚Äî salt water damage caused a short circuit that was spread to other cars by high winds, Fisker said at the time.

With all of this happening in public ‚Äî and in a presidential election year ‚Äî Fisker‚Äôs struggles became highly politicized. The company was mentioned numerous times in presidential debates and speeches leading up to the election. Republican nominee Romney called Fisker and other DOE-supported companies losers.

The company didn‚Äôt seem to invest substantially in technology innovation or tech IP, and seemed to spend a disproportionate amount on suppliers. For example, numerous sources have said that the company paid upfront for 15,000 of some of the parts for its planned 15,000 Karmas. It ended up only selling around 2,000 of the cars. It has also been said that Fisker paid some funds upfront to have BMW make engines for the 100,000 Nina cars it hoped to produce ‚Äî in the end, Fisker didn‚Äôt deliver a single Nina.

Costs to build each Karma also creeped up because the company missed its volume targets, and because engineering had to change designs around supplier constraints. The company ended up adding $20,000 to its initial sale price.

Expensive hires may also have sucked away chunks of Fisker‚Äôs funding: Sources say that Fisker filled the upper levels of the company with seasoned auto executives from Detroit. At the high point of Fisker, the company had around 300 employees, plus dozens of contract staff. Bringing in a certain amount of the old guard could help a car startup ramp up quickly, and also impress potential investors with ‚Äúindustry names.‚Äù But those people are also used to big auto-industry budgets that included extensive travel and salaries ‚Äî that‚Äôs the opposite life of a tech startup.

## Fisker Inc.

In July 2016, Henrik Fisker expressed interest in designing a fully connected electric car with autonomous driving features and an aesthetically pleasing look. He has pursued battery technology, and hinted at potentially reviving the Fisker name with a pure-electric vehicle using technology that nobody else has. Since then Fisker has talked about delays to the promised solid state battery technology, which he does not expect to be able to be produced in volume until at least 2025. Posing risk for competition from more scientifically experienced future solid state battery producers such as Quantumscape.

***Forbes:*** ‚ÄúNow he‚Äôs back‚Äìand three things are different. First and foremost, he has a vital new partner: his wife, cofounder and Fisker Inc. CFO Geeta Gupta-Fisker. Second, his Los Angeles-based company is public this time around, raising more than $1 billion in an October 2020 IPO. And finally, Fisker‚Äôs stock price, up 56% since its debut, has made both Henrik and Geeta billionaires, each worth about $1.1 billion as of Friday‚Äôs market close. The auto industry has seen father-son and sibling leadership teams, but Fisker Inc.‚Äôs CEO-CFO combo is the fast-changing sector‚Äôs first husband and wife power couple.‚Äù

Wealth isn‚Äôt the purpose of the new company, Henrik says. ‚ÄúI never got into cars because of money. (This shows he is willing to do what is in the best interest of the company because he is not motivated by money, unlike 99% of other CEO‚Äôs)

The couple sought a big stake in the new venture to ensure they can control its fate in a way Fisker couldn‚Äôt with his earlier company.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yzhded6pfw171.png?width=408&format=png&auto=webp&s=54b30259720cf853a8efeacf058f2f74315260b9

Henrik is an auto industry celebrity, but Geeta‚Äôs background is equally impressive. A native of India, she holds multiple degrees in science, including a Ph.D. in biotechnology from Cambridge University where she was also a Research Newton Fellow. From there, she started a career in international investment for Lloyds Banking Group, and then managed investments for a high-net-worth client for several years. (In particular, this is insanely important - Geeta **KNOWS MONEY**! She knows how best to keep a company afloat, organize its share structure, provide value to shareholders, etc. because she has worked in the industry before. She may just be the most important element of Fisker Inc., due to the financial experience she has. At every step of the way, she is likely to make decisions with one sole focus - increasing share price and value).

She met her future husband in 2011 when he was visiting London, just before things started going very wrong at Fisker Automotive. They married in 2012.

‚ÄúWhen I left Fisker Automotive, all I had was my car,‚Äù Henrik remembers. ‚ÄúI'm in a different position, mainly because of Geeta. Because she cuts the deals.‚Äù

To get the new venture off the ground, the Fiskers invested the majority of their life savings‚Äìan enormous financial risk given the fate of Henrik‚Äôs prior company. Then, just as they were locking in plans for the IPO back in July, they were hit by a highly unwelcome complication: Geeta learned she had early-stage breast cancer.

‚ÄúShe got the call (from her doctor) during a call with investors,‚Äù Henrik says. Despite that bombshell, she continued working with banks and investors in the weeks that followed, even as she underwent two surgical procedures and radiation therapy. Her medical therapy concluded in November.

Henrik, who marvels at her fortitude throughout the health crisis says, ‚Äúshe only missed something like one day of work...That's just how she is. She works tirelessly.‚Äù

## Fisker Ocean

The Fisker Ocean will have a nearly 300-mile range with an 80 kWh battery and a solar panel roof as a range extender, adding approximately 1,000 free miles of range per year. Advanced electronics will be housed under the hood, and the vehicle will incorporate recycled and sustainable materials throughout. Deliveries of the Ocean are scheduled to begin in 2022.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s87j6bdsfw171.png?width=438&format=png&auto=webp&s=e40add9ce53319d31db242cce73a303afb03cbab

Fisker has also announced a partnership with Electrify America to ensure Fisker Ocean vehicles will integrate seamlessly with Electrify America charging stations when the e-SUV hits the market. With features such as a solar roof and recycled inner materials, it will be, according to Fisker Inc., the ""world's most sustainable vehicle.""

In 2017, Fisker Inc. announced that it had filed patents on flexible solid-state battery designs. Fisker expected the batteries to be produced on a mass scale around 2020. A prototype of the battery debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018. In October 2018, Fisker announced new funding for battery development through Caterpillar Venture Capital. The solid-state batteries are intended to deliver longer vehicle range and faster charging times.

In 2018, Fisker was named to the board of directors of First Cobalt, a North American cobalt refinery that produces battery materials.

In September 2019, it was announced that Fisker Inc. was partnering with Game of Thrones actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who will serve as a partner and sustainability adviser to Fisker, to work on advanced, affordable, electric mobility models.

&#x200B;

[In addition to being a well-known actor, Coster-Waldau is also the United Nations Development Program Goodwill Ambassador for climate change and other social issues.](https://preview.redd.it/3hssff5vfw171.png?width=451&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebe55e2468c5b63d1bc0ac3c71547219dff5afaa)

Nikolaj wrote this piece about Fisker:

To quote a friend of mine who is a lot smarter than me, architect Bjarke Ingels: ‚ÄúThe idea that sustainability needs to sacrifice quality of life is a flawed one. It‚Äôs a design challenge, a challenge to build something that transforms the idea of sustainability into something that will increase the quality of life for all those around it.‚Äù

One person meeting that challenge is Henrik Fisker, who has designed some of the most iconic cars over the past decades for BMW and others, like the BMW Z8, Aston Martin DB9 and Aston Martin V8 Vantage. He‚Äôs a hero for gas-guzzling supercars. He is a fellow Dane, I am a fan, and we met, of all places, on Twitter.

When we met in person, he described his new project ‚Äî an all-electric luxury SUV ‚Äî and asked me if I would help spread the word on his car. The problem as I see it with most electric cars is that they only accomplish the basics. They get you from point A to B. They run electric so you don‚Äôt pollute while driving, but that‚Äôs it. They are basically unattractive combustion engine cars that have a battery thrown into them ‚Äî and for most of them, a battery with a limited range. What Fisker does is to try to make every part of the car in a sustainable and attractive way, like a full-length solar roof, recycled floor mats and vegan leather seats. It looks incredibly cool and inviting, with a great 250- to 300-mile range, and at a cost of just under $40,000, it‚Äôs a luxury car affordable to a mass market.

I said yes and even became an investor, not only because it‚Äôs a great car but more importantly, I hope and believe it can inspire other companies to actively incorporate sustainability goals into all aspects of their business. Fisker then had the idea of calling me ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù adviser. Which I am not. Just to be clear. Thanks Henrik, sounds cool, but I am an actor and a citizen, and that‚Äôs really it.

And what about Hollywood? Is our industry changing, are we at the forefront? Looking at social media, you would think so. And things are happening, but usually only when a camera is pointed at people. Remember a few years back when all awards shows only used EVs for the red carpet? We made a difference. We mattered. We showed the way. So cool. So green, so ‚Ä¶ brief. Now it‚Äôs back to the Escalade. But hey, we are not using plastic straws anymore!

To believe that change will come from Hollywood is not really based in reality (when did that stop us?), but we are great at reacting ‚Äî and things around us are changing, and changing us. I have a good friend who loves his SUV. It‚Äôs not electric. But he cannot give up his car. He is a good guy, he‚Äôs works for the U.N., so if he has a problem going electric, we all do. But if he is presented with an alternative that doesn‚Äôt mean a reduction in his quality of life, something like the Fisker SUV, I think he‚Äôd transition to electric in a heartbeat.

The IPO deal values Fisker Inc at US$2.9 billion, with an IPO share price of $10.

On July 30, 2020, Fisker announced plans for a four-vehicle portfolio by 2025. The Fisker Ocean SUV will be joined by a sports sedan based on their previously announced Fisker Emotion concept, a coupe-like SUV, and a lifestyle pickup truck. All will be electric vehicles.

On October 15, 2020, Fisker Inc announced it would be outsourcing vehicle production of its Fisker Ocean electric SUV to Magna Steyr, to reduce the complexities and costs related to the building and operating its own factory. Magna will start building the Fisker Ocean in Europe in 2022.

## Henrik Fisker Interview quotes:

I have people on Twitter saying, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just make the car next month? You have a prototype.‚Äù Most people don‚Äôt understand that it takes 18 months to do long-lead body tooling for high-volume vehicles. Most people don‚Äôt understand it takes two years to do durability tests and do all the engineering certification and everything else.

And on the business model itself, I believe that there is nobody in the near future or the next couple of years that‚Äôs going to make a million EVs on one model. Today, there‚Äôs nobody doing it. Tesla probably has the highest volume of one single model, a couple hundred thousand. But even the big giant established carmakers are not making, right now, a couple hundred thousand vehicles of one model. So the way you get volume, in my view, is if you partner up with other OEMs and share some of the expensive parts of the platform, which in my view is not anymore something that is unique IP or something that is a unique experience to the customer. An aluminum stamped floor or a steel stamped floor really doesn‚Äôt have any brand value anymore.

And obviously, as we move forward, we always start to do some of the things ourselves. But it was really about de-risking in our first vehicle to market. So we‚Äôre going to do another three vehicles, which we can do because we don‚Äôt have to spend all our money and effort on learning how to manufacture a car, for instance.

So we have programmed a lot. We have hired a head of ESG, environmental and social governance, and he is really spearheading developing specific... we kind of put out some goals that we would like to reach with suppliers, and we at least try to bring them in that direction. They are not reaching those goals right now, but they may reach them later. And then we have goals for ourselves. So for instance, we look at transport. Are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs closer to the plant, or are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs on the other side of the planet that way we have to then transport all that stuff. So those are the types of things that we‚Äôre really thinking about now as we‚Äôre nominating suppliers. And finally, materials as well, looking at sustainable materials. We‚Äôve actually picked up a lot of knowledge on that side as well, where we are adding more sustainable materials to our vehicle. So we are actually looking across everything ‚Äî supply chain, where the suppliers are located, what the suppliers are doing for sustainability, and also then of course in the vehicle itself ‚Äî in terms of the type of materials there.

So - let's summarize - prices are rising at their fastest pace in almost 30 years and incomes just plunged by their most ever! We're gonna need more stimmies!""  

Plus  to above; 

Last year, Hirschman Capital noted that since 1821, 98% of sovereigns that hit 130% debt/GDP have defaulted on their sovereign debt.   

The US hit 130% late last year. 

Simple Conclussion : The Fed can‚Äôt go ‚Äúhawkish‚Äù and raise rates without sending markets ‚Äìand economies‚Äìto their knees; by extension, they now have nothing left to ‚Äúcut‚Äù when the current everything bubble implodes.

And that  is a *real problem*.

 There are only two ways for sovereigns to default: 

Inflation or collapse.    

The latter is not an option. 

 As for a solution, what‚Äôs so tragic is that the only option before the Fed is an even bigger problem‚Äîcurrent and inevitably more inflation. 

 That is, if the Fed wants to keep markets (and their job security) breathing, they no longer have the foregoing template of ‚Äúrate-hike-followed-by-rate-cutting‚Äù at their disposal, which means they now have no choice but to dovishly keep rates near the zero-bound indefinitely.

But the only way to keep rates ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù and nailed to the floor of time is to purchase otherwise unwanted bonds to keep their prices elevated and hence yields and rates repressed.

Such bond ‚Äúaccommodation,‚Äù of course, costs money, and as we already know, the only ‚Äúmoney‚Äù the Fed has to spend is the kind they create out of thin air‚Äì the very kind of money (and policy) which leads to the kind of inflation discussed above‚Äînamely, the brutal kind.

 As for that fake money, the evidence of the Fed‚Äôs desperate (and only) direction is now obvious, as the following M2 money supply makes equally clear. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v774ta55sw171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e73c839beb67a67eea9aed7de4ac61d86813840

 

Fed is so embarrassed by this ‚Äúprinting solution‚Äù that they‚Äôve stopped *weekly* reporting of M2 data, and frankly, since March, have even stopped *monthly* reporting of the same.

That, of course, is both telling as well as disgraceful‚Ä¶ The Fed literally has something to hide, and that never bodes well, does it?

&#x200B;

 The correlation to central bank balance sheet (i.e., money supply) expansion and rising markets is now beyond dispute. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sgizb6xcsw171.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=aad2fe681fe0c49ac20368aba77e86c118b22959

 In short‚Äîdo you see the correlation and pattern? Do you see how the Fed‚Äôs market sausage is made? More importantly, do you now see the Fed‚Äôs self-made conundrum? 

 

Given that the Fed bows to the markets not the people, which choice do you think they‚Äôll make?

In other words, expect more money printing and more yield curve control‚Äîand hence more money creation, more inflation, and by extension more fiat currency debasement.

 More money supply to keep rates monetized simply means more currency debasement and rising inflation.",nn51ou,"""Fed's ""Favorite"" #Inflation Indicator (PCE) Explodes At Fastest Rate Since 1992 As Incomes Crash By Record"""

3109,,2021-05-28 20:45:08,t3_nn76we,,wallstreetbets,"TLDR:

I have leading indicators telling me that there are two concurrent shifts underway when it comes to who is purchasing homes.

\- Massive increase in unmarried people buying houses alone. This used to be somewhat unusual, now it's becoming very common.

\- Massive increase in unmarried men, in particular, buying houses alone. Traditionally, the female-to-male ratio of unmarried homebuyers was about 5 to 1. For the last 3 months, it's been closer to 50/50.

Source is my own closed real estate purchase transactions. Am a mortgage broker (btw this means cash purchases are ""invisible"" to me). It takes 3-6 months for [HMDA data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Mortgage_Disclosure_Act) to become accessible to journalists and academics, and thus ""visible"" to the general public (assuming journalists deem it worthy of commenting on), but I can see the trends live in real time.

How would one go about placing a bet that in about 3 or 6 months, the media, journalists, academics, etc, will pick up on this, publish articles, and potentially cause a lot of people to buy certain stocks. Which stocks would that be? Is there a ""Mancave, Inc"" out there that would potentially get an uptick? Or maybe a company making smart-home stuff that is particularly suited to renting by the room (the single men are not buying 1 bedroom condos, they are buying proper houses with 3 bedrooms, etc)?

EDIT: oh, and to be clear. It's not just an uptick in single men. It's an uptick in women too, but a massive surge from the men. It used to be that for 15 banana sales, 10 are to married couples, 4 to single women, and 1 to a single man. Now for the same 15 banana sales, it's 6 to married couples, 6 to single women, and 3 to single men, something like that.",nn76we,Homebuyer Demographics Shift towards single and male. How to bet?

I have been doing research and talking to as many people I can that have some sort of experience/knowledge when dealing with the stock market. I heard about the potential to get into AMC and make some serious profit. I invested early on when shares were selling for around $8.00. I kept reading we need to hold until June 2nd and reevaluate. That‚Äôs my current plan, but hey I don‚Äôt know much about the game lol.

My current understanding of why there is a squeeze is because of previous events which backed hedge funds into a corner. Basically the hedge funds have had to borrow shares to pay off debt to companies like GME. When borrowing those shares, hedge fund companies left themselves vulnerable because they have no more money to borrow to pay off their debt. So if everyone buys stock in AMC and holds it, then the hedge fund companies are forced to pay out. The more people that buy and hold their shares then the higher the shares are worth and over time it will pay a profit. 

Like I said, I‚Äôm new to the game and this is just my current understanding of how the masses can manipulate the stock market. Please comment and enlighten me on another view point or correct my understanding. Let‚Äôs all get rich and work together with the power of knowledge!

Fact 1: 450M shares outstanding according to most sources

Fact 2: 536M shares outstanding according to Seeking Alpha

Speculation based on facts 1 and 2: I've heard from a few sources (speculation only, though) that the 86M discrepancy (536M - 450M) is how much is shorted under the table.  This seems reasonable, as Stonk-O-Tracker has been showing ~50-60% dark pool short percentage since it started reporting it.

Fact 3: Visible short shares increased from 87M yesterday to 95M today

Fact 4: 19.25% to 23% is held short according to various sources

Interpretation of math: 20% of 450M is 90M, which coincides with the visible short positions.  95M + 86M = 181M, 40% of the total 450M.

A short squeeze happens as shorts cover their positions, and since short positions have actually increased then this still isn't the short squeeze.  I do believe we had a gamma squeeze this week (market makers hedging ITM call options), which will aid a ton in triggering a short squeeze.

June 2nd (Wednesday) is the share count where they determine who is and isn't a shareholder.  It's also where they have a huge opportunity to crack down on synthetic shares, but I won't hold my breath that it's the big day.

Opinion only!!!
My prediction is that the real short squeeze will start only when the synthetic shares are forcibly returned (may or may not be next week).  Then, the price will go up even more (may dip between now and then), which will make the cost to borrow astronomical because it's based on share price.  Let's not forget that high volume we've been having decreases the days to cover, which decreases the borrow fee rate, so it may look like the cost to borrow went down significantly when it actually didn't.  This first squeeze will be what causes the legit shorts to also be returned or recalled, triggering a squeeze on top of the squeeze.",nnbog8,"I ate a bucket of crayons at the theater, pic in comments"

This shit is going down down down.

-@Kevin

I posted a DD on a different wallstreetbets sub a few weeks ago for shorting peloton. I was considering updating it and posting it here again on the main wallstreetbets sub. I‚Äôve been tracking the number of available bikes on FB, CL, and the number seems to be trending up. But it will take a few more weeks to get a good sense of where that is heading. I haven‚Äôt posted this on the yahoo finance board because it‚Äôs just such a pain in the ass to post on there and make it clear what you‚Äôre trying to say. 

I‚Äôm also tracking the comment volume on r/pelotoncycle in the New Buyer Thread. The trends on that are a bit mixed. Comment volume was headed down until recently. But the overall trends for the popularity of the subreddit r/pelotoncycle are heading down. The same can be said for other social media accounts for peloton. Other metrics I‚Äôm also looking at like App Store ranking, website traffic, etc are already compiled on various sites so I don‚Äôt need to track them. But again, those trends point towards slowing growth. 

Now, of course you don‚Äôt need to know all of these things to have the view that this shit stock is headed down. I personally wanted to track these metrics to confirm that I‚Äôm at least in the right ballpark when it comes to timing the drop. I do think that ‚Äúinvestors aka speculators‚Äù are nervous and will bail quickly if the growth narrative changes. It‚Äôs my expectation that the slowing growth will be confirmed in the next conference call, and especially when they give projections for FY 2022. 

Of course, things could also go the other way. The execs are the biggest cheerleading group in the world.  They skirt saying anything negative about the business and try to be vague around things which could potentially be bad. I can‚Äôt say if it‚Äôs fraud or not, as I‚Äôm not an expert, but they skate a very thin line. Nobody knows for sure when the stock will bang on down to where it should be.

I‚Äôve went back and forth on actually sharing this stuff here because I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessary for the stock to drop. There is also no guarantee that the post gains traction. Of course, back in March of last year being a bear was all the rage. At the end of the day, people are here to make (mostly lose) money. So I could see people hopping on board if it was well written and compelling. But what does that accomplish? It would make your borrow rate go up and puts more expensive. Great for short term profits, but bad for long term profits. 

By the way, people on here love pictures, charts with big trend arrows, and they need things spelled out very clearly. Most won‚Äôt read. And actually, most of them hate hate hate bears and will probably never consider shorting. You‚Äôd have to convince them that the company is destroying something they value. Perhaps child murder is enough of a reason, who knows.",,

Tesla was shorted because its valuation was disproportionate to its financials. People commenting that it‚Äôs not a safe investment are doing so because its valuation is disproportionate to its financials. Any company whose valuation is disproportionate to its financials will get shorted. The shorters are not commenting at you, and you‚Äôre turning a stats problem into a team sport like a cultists.

> Is Tesla $800 right now? I‚Äôm talking about buying it at the current $600ish valuation it is now.

What analysis did you do that led you to the conclusion that it was worth more than what you bought it for? What math went into that?

Everyone is talking about how the squeeze didn't even happen and the shorts didn't cover yet. What I don't understand is why wouldn't that be possible? If short interest is 17%, so let's round up to about 100M shares. Today the volume traded was 700M shares. Couldn't 100M of those 700M have been the shorts covering? And if they didn't cover, today alone 700M shares were traded, why would 100M shares bought by shorts cause a squeeze if today 700M were traded?

I have been having this question for awhile, since I noticed the same with GME. In the days preceding January 28th (when GME reached its peak), the combined volume was several times the amount of float. How come the squeeze happened and why did it happen? If the volume was so high, couldn't the shorts have covered in the days preceding that?

Everything looked to have gone off successfully. We are now waiting on the data and craft to be analysed and inspected. This will take a few weeks according to Michael Colglazier.
That being said he had already outlined the test schedule in the earnings zoom call.

1st test flight - may 
2nd crewed flight - June 
3rd flight with R Branson on board late June/July 

4th flight this will be taking the Italian airforce on a training mission (600k a seat) late July


On the run in to the first test flight some possible maintenance issues appeared with the carrier plane White knight 2‚Ä¶. 
This indeed could have gone either way , after 2 weeks inspections it was decided that WK2 did not need to delay testing no maintenance was needed at this point. Scheduled Maintenance will commence in the fall after all tests have been completed.
Upon this news it is my opinion that the testing programme will go ahead as planned.

The market has responded accordingly and the stock is now up from $17-‚Ç¨31

With all these catalysts lined up before the end of the year and commercial operations looming for early 2022 things are looking up for Virgin Galactic.The success of the last test flight the company have now proven tech and concept.

I had a look at $BB and assume that we finally formed the bottom. In the last few days we saw a sharp rise which might continue in the next weeks. If we can break the 12$ resistance, the next targets would be aroung 25-28$. 

Using Elliot wave theory we are probably at the end of the correction wave 4 and now began with the bullish wave 5.

Price targets:

\#1 12$

\#2 25$

3763,,2021-05-28 09:17:32,t3_nmtt43,,wallstreetbets,"Trainline has taken a huge dip since the UK government's announcement of the plan to nationalise the railway network. The plan includes creating an online ticketing platform by Great British Railways which might have a huge blow on Trainline revenue. However, this platform does not yet exist and will probably take a couple of years to develop. Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed.

In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales.  Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%.

I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time  for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

This is my first time making a post here, please do give constructive feedback and criticism.

3768,,2021-05-28 10:41:01,t3_nmuzzi,,wallstreetbets,"Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent of Modernas if not more. Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects) 

Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

Imagine if the spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize one piece to understand the whole picture it and helps modify your DNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates it can still recognize the virus. In contrast to using one portion of the picture as it mutates it's easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine, that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. Not only that but they have had the least amount of side effects of any covid vaccine deeming it the safest covid vaccine.... 

And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein (whole picture) and the safety profile. Also worth a mention is that you could store it in a regular refrigerator, and let it sit out in room temperature while you're vaccinating people instead of a special ultra low temp freeze needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers, this is a majority of the world. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines so other protein competitors will be far behind and they will have an a moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing they teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine. They will be combining flu and covid vaccine by 2025 for possibly double the price of current covid vaccine.

 They are pretty much de-risked at this point. Yes you could buy other  biotechs that can go up 20x but are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up) that has all successful trials done so far, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment to where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place there are no more glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""

They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. Yesterday at market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. 
 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

Future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract in there ( in the link below in another message). It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 

As far as my position I own some $200 July calls along with about 933 shares. I'm all in baby.  Been in since $4.06, I panicked and sold once during February a couple months during the mini bear market we had and got back in a bit too early so got a wash sale üôà but I'm diamond hands all the way to $800 from here.  LFG I expect to turn that into a cool million in a year's time via shares and options based on the DD provided. Just know this isn't all completely my DD some of this is taken from my good friends at the community Nvax community on Stocktwits. They're one of the most hardcore groups that provides excellent DD and are always willing to help each other a hand if anyone's got questions highly recommend to check it out. So my point is this is information collected over the months that is a group consensus on nvax future price. (Check out next link below this paragraph, it has My positions and an amazing DD chart converting contracts to future price and comparing with competitors. My screen name on stovktwits  is the same on there Johnnyknowsbest. Been on there and here since i started with nvax.

Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. This is huge as the combo is going to differentiate them especially since both flu and covid vaccines are first in class.

A) On page 6 of the 10-Q, you will find Revenue of ""Connected Fitness Products"" (aka Bike Sales) to be $261.6M
B) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $316.7M
C) % of Bike Sales per TOTAL Revenue: $261.6M / $316.7M * 100 = 82.6% {""Connected Fitness Products"" Revenue (aka Bike Sales)}
5) Apply 82.6% to the TOTAL Revenue $223.3M for Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19): $223.3M x 0.826 = $184.45M {Bike Sales for Q4 of fiscal '19}
6) Per the CFO, ""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior."":

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote... By mid-July, we‚Äôll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase precious metals  especially silver amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative 

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

Gold rose over 60% in the 1930s as the prices of stocks and real estate crashed. You could buy an entire block with a one ounce gold coin. Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms.

I must address Cramer's statement because he is obviously trying to add fuel to the short-selling fire: When he says ""we're not going natural gas"" he is clearly making a vague and general statement meant to be interpreted in the worst possible way: ""no one is going to buy or use natural gas."" By now, I hope everyone that is interested in this stock understands that CLNE offers an alternative transportation fuel, thus, the investments made by BP and Chevron, and not revolutionary technology like some EV's (but this is mostly hype meant to catapult EVs to the front. What most people do not realize is that driverless technology and such can be placed in Petro vehicles too). Also, unfortunately, the company has done a terrible marketting job. That's why powerful analysts can get away with making vague and unsupported statements. The fact that Cramer explained the stock's decrease over the last month as being due to widespread dissaproval is misleading, at best. Many people do not yet know about the cleanliness and therapeutic effects RNG has on the climate.

The News...

If you haven't read yet it looks like Federal Cannabis legalization my be around the corner. [Here](https://www.mpp.org/policy/federal/the-more-act/) is the House Bill. Supporters seem on board and like the reforms they have done to the bill including rescheduling cannabis. [Last time](https://mjbizdaily.com/key-us-house-lawmaker-reintroduces-federal-marijuana-legalization-bill/) the bill was introduced it cleared the House.   


Personally I think this gets a lot of support especially from a fiscal point of view. With stimulus stalling and a giant debate going on about how to pay for the stimulus I think cannabis offers the easiest way to collect federal revenue. A simple review of the bill and the fiscal benefits to the Fed's can be read [here](https://www.justtherealnews.com/congress/nadler-blumenauer-lee-jackson-lee-jeffries-velazquez-reintroduce-comprehensive-marijuana-reform-legislation/). The bill states a 5% fed tax. Money coming for uncle Sam, right when questions about paying for stimulus.... Personally I think it adds up, but that's for you to decide. 

Okay so that's the hype...

Let's talk about the tickers listed ($SNDL and $TLRY). 

$SNDL

I'll start with the cheaper YOLO, $SNDL. $SNDL short interest isn't high, but the company did issue convertible notes a while back around .7c if my memory is correct. I'm not saying they won't do it again, but they should be in a good place fiscally for now. Float is high with about 1.6B shares out there. However today's volume at the time of writing is over 415M. That's not bad given such a high float. It's about 200% more than the average volume. 

The options chain on $SNDL has me giddy. With over 200,000 options currently in the money on todays move above $1 there is some high potential here for some interesting action. The put to call ratio is just obnoxiously low at .08 it's screaming upwards betting. If we hold above $1 the potential squeeze up could be amazing.   


It's also broken up on the trend lines and out of the downward channel it was in. The regression channel from the peak squeeze back in Feb just broke out today according to my crayons I have laying around. 

$TLRY

$TLRY was the squeeze of a lifetime if you remember it back in 19'. The ticker was just a money printer with it's low float and stupid hype. Then they proceeded to do, like they all do, and issue debt. Shares tumbled since then falling from $120 --> $5. Ouch bag holders.   


Like all the cannabis stocks the Feb bump pushed $TLRY to above $60 in an amazing move. $TLRY has a lower short interest than $SNDL, but it also has a much lower float at about 300M. Compared to $SNDL the volume here isn't as good, but still remains decently above the avg volume around 36M as of right now. 

If we peep the options chain we also see a crazy low P/C ratio around .11. But we don't have the Open Interest in the chain like $SNDL does unless you roll out to Jun 18. Then we finally get some decent OI.   


Personally I am going with $SNDL. The option's chain looks better, the stock is cheaper, and the short interest is a little better. My advice would be to roll out till at least the Jun 11th $1 strike to not get eaten alive by Theta and IV crush. But WSB does what WSB wants and that's why I love you all.   
Do not go above the $2 strikes IMO. You will get crushed by theta unless we get an insane move, which could happen but I don't see the risk / reward there.",nn326f,MORE ACT / CANNABIS / $SNDL & $TLRY Potential

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday

>Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers‚Äô attempt to corner the market on the metal.

-
>Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926‚Äì2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers‚Äô Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.

-
>By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged‚ÄîMarch 27‚Äîsilver fell to $10.80, the metal‚Äôs biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, ‚ÄúA billion dollars isn‚Äôt what it used to be,‚Äù the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.

-
>To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978‚Äì91) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities.",nn36fw,There is no silver short squeeze happening.

* Henrik has learned from all the mistakes he made with his previous attempt to create Fisker Automotive, and will certainly do everything in his power to avoid that mess again. He has designed systems into the intricacies of the company to avoid failure - meaning Fisker Inc is guaranteed to succeed

* Large Fleet market in Europe gaining momentum, and 700+ Fisker reservations in this market alone
* 16,000+ reservations already. More than Tesla had 18 months pre-production
* Revenue streams include leasing automotives, servicing, selling emissions credits, selling insurance (like selling the pickaxe to miners, and selling the diamonds to the mine owners too, absolutely genius - Fisker are insuring cars which they own, because the customer is only leasing it)
* High short interest (20%+), high analyst price targets compared to current share price (100%+) and low valuation compared to peers ($3bn market cap currently)
* Designing the first ever all-electric popemobile - Massive, soon to be historic, event!
* I give $FSR (currently $13 a share) a price target of $100 by end of year 2022, if not sooner
* Price Targets: $35 by end of year - Previous ATH. $50 start of next year - European and Chinese debut of prototypes. $100 end of 2022 - start of production (SOP). $150+ 2023
* 2025 Price Targets, calculated using projected data: Bear case - $97 a share, Bull case - $519 a share
* Downside in the short term is capped by the large amount of cash on hand - one third of market cap is cash. Long term, is capped by risk factors, which are almost eligible and affect every automotive startup anyway.

## Fisker Automotive

In 2008, Fisker Automotive raised over $90 million from investors including venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. In September 2009, Fisker Automotive was awarded a $528 million loan guarantee by the United States Department of Energy (DOE). The automaker was one of four recipients of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, to encourage the domestic manufacture of electric cars. The funds were to be used to develop the Karma, as well as an affordable family-size plug-in hybrid car. The loan facility was frozen at $192 million in February 2012, after the DOE claimed that Fisker missed its milestones

In December 2011, just as the Fisker Karma was launched, its battery supplier, A123 Systems, recalled all batteries, followed by a second recall in 2012. A123 filed for bankruptcy in October 2012, leaving Fisker Automotive without a battery supplier. After selling approximately 2,000 units, production of the Fisker Karma was suspended in November 2012, in the absence of its battery supplier.

&#x200B;

Henrik Fisker resigned as chairman from Fisker Automotive in March 2013, because of disagreements with management about business strategy. Later that year, the company declared voluntary bankruptcy.Fisker raised and spent more than a billion dollars over its lifetime.The heart of Fisker‚Äôs business model was in that early deal with Quantum. The idea was to design a gorgeous car, and have suppliers like Quantum provide the technology because off-the-shelf parts from suppliers would help keep costs down.

But there were problems with this strategy: Sometimes, those parts had to be custom-made to fit the design vision, which resulted in higher prices for Fisker. Other times, parts were delivered late or, worse, faulty, but Fisker was locked in to those supplier relationships. Sources close to Fisker have also said that many of the parts were owned by the suppliers themselves, so Fisker didn‚Äôt own a lot of the internal technology.

The broker that raised funds for Fisker automotive, by selling their private shares, was Advanced Equities.It wasn‚Äôt until December 2011 and into 2012 that the more dubious efforts of Advanced Equities became clearer to Fisker‚Äôs hundreds of investors. The last few hundred million dollars of Advanced Equities‚Äô fund raising for Fisker, starting with the D-1 round, was what brokers call ‚Äúpay to play.‚Äù As Fisker was running into technical, delivery and political problems, its valuation was quickly declining. But the company still needed more money, so the brokers went back to its current investors and said: Unless you give this more, your current shares will be diluted and your preferred stock will be converted to common stock.

It was essentially a gun to their heads. This is why investor Wray sued Fisker in February 2012, alleging he was on the receiving end of this tactic. In his lawsuit, he says Advanced Equities sent him a letter dated Jan. 18, 2012, stating that he needed to decide if he wanted to invest in Fisker‚Äôs next round, and pay around $84,000 by Jan. 27, 2012 ‚Äî a little over a week from receiving the letter. He also says that Advanced Equities assured him that he would have anti-dilution protection. According to the audio clip from Advanced Equities‚Äô internal sales call in early 2010, Advanced Equity leaders say that the Fisker deal will ‚Äúsuffer no dilution,‚Äù and was ‚Äúa dream scenario.‚Äù

That dream would soon end. In September 2012 after Fisker closed on $1.2 billion in funding, the bulk of it organized by Advanced Equities, the SEC charged the broker with misleading investors when it raised money for another company back in 2009 and 2010 (Bloom Energy). Advanced settled, agreeing to pay $1 million, and its co-founders were personally fined. Two months later Advanced Equities closed up shop.

Later, A123 Systems itself went bankrupt, causing more problems for Fisker. Fisker claimed that A123 Systems owed it $140 million, but a bankruptcy settlement reduced that to a paltry $15 million.

Then there was the just plain terrible luck for the ironically named Karma: Super Storm Sandy wiped out 338 of its Karmas in storage in New Jersey. The cars first drowned, and then caught on fire ‚Äî salt water damage caused a short circuit that was spread to other cars by high winds, Fisker said at the time.

With all of this happening in public ‚Äî and in a presidential election year ‚Äî Fisker‚Äôs struggles became highly politicized. The company was mentioned numerous times in presidential debates and speeches leading up to the election. Republican nominee Romney called Fisker and other DOE-supported companies losers.

The company didn‚Äôt seem to invest substantially in technology innovation or tech IP, and seemed to spend a disproportionate amount on suppliers. For example, numerous sources have said that the company paid upfront for 15,000 of some of the parts for its planned 15,000 Karmas. It ended up only selling around 2,000 of the cars. It has also been said that Fisker paid some funds upfront to have BMW make engines for the 100,000 Nina cars it hoped to produce ‚Äî in the end, Fisker didn‚Äôt deliver a single Nina.

Costs to build each Karma also creeped up because the company missed its volume targets, and because engineering had to change designs around supplier constraints. The company ended up adding $20,000 to its initial sale price.

Expensive hires may also have sucked away chunks of Fisker‚Äôs funding: Sources say that Fisker filled the upper levels of the company with seasoned auto executives from Detroit. At the high point of Fisker, the company had around 300 employees, plus dozens of contract staff. Bringing in a certain amount of the old guard could help a car startup ramp up quickly, and also impress potential investors with ‚Äúindustry names.‚Äù But those people are also used to big auto-industry budgets that included extensive travel and salaries ‚Äî that‚Äôs the opposite life of a tech startup.

## Fisker Inc.

In July 2016, Henrik Fisker expressed interest in designing a fully connected electric car with autonomous driving features and an aesthetically pleasing look. He has pursued battery technology, and hinted at potentially reviving the Fisker name with a pure-electric vehicle using technology that nobody else has. Since then Fisker has talked about delays to the promised solid state battery technology, which he does not expect to be able to be produced in volume until at least 2025. Posing risk for competition from more scientifically experienced future solid state battery producers such as Quantumscape.

***Forbes:*** ‚ÄúNow he‚Äôs back‚Äìand three things are different. First and foremost, he has a vital new partner: his wife, cofounder and Fisker Inc. CFO Geeta Gupta-Fisker. Second, his Los Angeles-based company is public this time around, raising more than $1 billion in an October 2020 IPO. And finally, Fisker‚Äôs stock price, up 56% since its debut, has made both Henrik and Geeta billionaires, each worth about $1.1 billion as of Friday‚Äôs market close. The auto industry has seen father-son and sibling leadership teams, but Fisker Inc.‚Äôs CEO-CFO combo is the fast-changing sector‚Äôs first husband and wife power couple.‚Äù

Wealth isn‚Äôt the purpose of the new company, Henrik says. ‚ÄúI never got into cars because of money. (This shows he is willing to do what is in the best interest of the company because he is not motivated by money, unlike 99% of other CEO‚Äôs)

The couple sought a big stake in the new venture to ensure they can control its fate in a way Fisker couldn‚Äôt with his earlier company.

Henrik is an auto industry celebrity, but Geeta‚Äôs background is equally impressive. A native of India, she holds multiple degrees in science, including a Ph.D. in biotechnology from Cambridge University where she was also a Research Newton Fellow. From there, she started a career in international investment for Lloyds Banking Group, and then managed investments for a high-net-worth client for several years. (In particular, this is insanely important - Geeta **KNOWS MONEY**! She knows how best to keep a company afloat, organize its share structure, provide value to shareholders, etc. because she has worked in the industry before. She may just be the most important element of Fisker Inc., due to the financial experience she has. At every step of the way, she is likely to make decisions with one sole focus - increasing share price and value).

She met her future husband in 2011 when he was visiting London, just before things started going very wrong at Fisker Automotive. They married in 2012.

‚ÄúWhen I left Fisker Automotive, all I had was my car,‚Äù Henrik remembers. ‚ÄúI'm in a different position, mainly because of Geeta. Because she cuts the deals.‚Äù

To get the new venture off the ground, the Fiskers invested the majority of their life savings‚Äìan enormous financial risk given the fate of Henrik‚Äôs prior company. Then, just as they were locking in plans for the IPO back in July, they were hit by a highly unwelcome complication: Geeta learned she had early-stage breast cancer.

‚ÄúShe got the call (from her doctor) during a call with investors,‚Äù Henrik says. Despite that bombshell, she continued working with banks and investors in the weeks that followed, even as she underwent two surgical procedures and radiation therapy. Her medical therapy concluded in November.

Henrik, who marvels at her fortitude throughout the health crisis says, ‚Äúshe only missed something like one day of work...That's just how she is. She works tirelessly.‚Äù

## Fisker Ocean

The Fisker Ocean will have a nearly 300-mile range with an 80 kWh battery and a solar panel roof as a range extender, adding approximately 1,000 free miles of range per year. Advanced electronics will be housed under the hood, and the vehicle will incorporate recycled and sustainable materials throughout. Deliveries of the Ocean are scheduled to begin in 2022.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s87j6bdsfw171.png?width=438&format=png&auto=webp&s=e40add9ce53319d31db242cce73a303afb03cbab

Fisker has also announced a partnership with Electrify America to ensure Fisker Ocean vehicles will integrate seamlessly with Electrify America charging stations when the e-SUV hits the market. With features such as a solar roof and recycled inner materials, it will be, according to Fisker Inc., the ""world's most sustainable vehicle.""

In 2017, Fisker Inc. announced that it had filed patents on flexible solid-state battery designs. Fisker expected the batteries to be produced on a mass scale around 2020. A prototype of the battery debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018. In October 2018, Fisker announced new funding for battery development through Caterpillar Venture Capital. The solid-state batteries are intended to deliver longer vehicle range and faster charging times.

In 2018, Fisker was named to the board of directors of First Cobalt, a North American cobalt refinery that produces battery materials.

In September 2019, it was announced that Fisker Inc. was partnering with Game of Thrones actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who will serve as a partner and sustainability adviser to Fisker, to work on advanced, affordable, electric mobility models.

&#x200B;

[In addition to being a well-known actor, Coster-Waldau is also the United Nations Development Program Goodwill Ambassador for climate change and other social issues.](https://preview.redd.it/3hssff5vfw171.png?width=451&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebe55e2468c5b63d1bc0ac3c71547219dff5afaa)

Nikolaj wrote this piece about Fisker:

To quote a friend of mine who is a lot smarter than me, architect Bjarke Ingels: ‚ÄúThe idea that sustainability needs to sacrifice quality of life is a flawed one. It‚Äôs a design challenge, a challenge to build something that transforms the idea of sustainability into something that will increase the quality of life for all those around it.‚Äù

One person meeting that challenge is Henrik Fisker, who has designed some of the most iconic cars over the past decades for BMW and others, like the BMW Z8, Aston Martin DB9 and Aston Martin V8 Vantage. He‚Äôs a hero for gas-guzzling supercars. He is a fellow Dane, I am a fan, and we met, of all places, on Twitter.

When we met in person, he described his new project ‚Äî an all-electric luxury SUV ‚Äî and asked me if I would help spread the word on his car. The problem as I see it with most electric cars is that they only accomplish the basics. They get you from point A to B. They run electric so you don‚Äôt pollute while driving, but that‚Äôs it. They are basically unattractive combustion engine cars that have a battery thrown into them ‚Äî and for most of them, a battery with a limited range. What Fisker does is to try to make every part of the car in a sustainable and attractive way, like a full-length solar roof, recycled floor mats and vegan leather seats. It looks incredibly cool and inviting, with a great 250- to 300-mile range, and at a cost of just under $40,000, it‚Äôs a luxury car affordable to a mass market.

I said yes and even became an investor, not only because it‚Äôs a great car but more importantly, I hope and believe it can inspire other companies to actively incorporate sustainability goals into all aspects of their business. Fisker then had the idea of calling me ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù adviser. Which I am not. Just to be clear. Thanks Henrik, sounds cool, but I am an actor and a citizen, and that‚Äôs really it.

And what about Hollywood? Is our industry changing, are we at the forefront? Looking at social media, you would think so. And things are happening, but usually only when a camera is pointed at people. Remember a few years back when all awards shows only used EVs for the red carpet? We made a difference. We mattered. We showed the way. So cool. So green, so ‚Ä¶ brief. Now it‚Äôs back to the Escalade. But hey, we are not using plastic straws anymore!

To believe that change will come from Hollywood is not really based in reality (when did that stop us?), but we are great at reacting ‚Äî and things around us are changing, and changing us. I have a good friend who loves his SUV. It‚Äôs not electric. But he cannot give up his car. He is a good guy, he‚Äôs works for the U.N., so if he has a problem going electric, we all do. But if he is presented with an alternative that doesn‚Äôt mean a reduction in his quality of life, something like the Fisker SUV, I think he‚Äôd transition to electric in a heartbeat.

The IPO deal values Fisker Inc at US$2.9 billion, with an IPO share price of $10.

On July 30, 2020, Fisker announced plans for a four-vehicle portfolio by 2025. The Fisker Ocean SUV will be joined by a sports sedan based on their previously announced Fisker Emotion concept, a coupe-like SUV, and a lifestyle pickup truck. All will be electric vehicles.

On October 15, 2020, Fisker Inc announced it would be outsourcing vehicle production of its Fisker Ocean electric SUV to Magna Steyr, to reduce the complexities and costs related to the building and operating its own factory. Magna will start building the Fisker Ocean in Europe in 2022.

## Henrik Fisker Interview quotes:

I have people on Twitter saying, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just make the car next month? You have a prototype.‚Äù Most people don‚Äôt understand that it takes 18 months to do long-lead body tooling for high-volume vehicles. Most people don‚Äôt understand it takes two years to do durability tests and do all the engineering certification and everything else.

And on the business model itself, I believe that there is nobody in the near future or the next couple of years that‚Äôs going to make a million EVs on one model. Today, there‚Äôs nobody doing it. Tesla probably has the highest volume of one single model, a couple hundred thousand. But even the big giant established carmakers are not making, right now, a couple hundred thousand vehicles of one model. So the way you get volume, in my view, is if you partner up with other OEMs and share some of the expensive parts of the platform, which in my view is not anymore something that is unique IP or something that is a unique experience to the customer. An aluminum stamped floor or a steel stamped floor really doesn‚Äôt have any brand value anymore.

And obviously, as we move forward, we always start to do some of the things ourselves. But it was really about de-risking in our first vehicle to market. So we‚Äôre going to do another three vehicles, which we can do because we don‚Äôt have to spend all our money and effort on learning how to manufacture a car, for instance.

So we have programmed a lot. We have hired a head of ESG, environmental and social governance, and he is really spearheading developing specific... we kind of put out some goals that we would like to reach with suppliers, and we at least try to bring them in that direction. They are not reaching those goals right now, but they may reach them later. And then we have goals for ourselves. So for instance, we look at transport. Are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs closer to the plant, or are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs on the other side of the planet that way we have to then transport all that stuff. So those are the types of things that we‚Äôre really thinking about now as we‚Äôre nominating suppliers. And finally, materials as well, looking at sustainable materials. We‚Äôve actually picked up a lot of knowledge on that side as well, where we are adding more sustainable materials to our vehicle. So we are actually looking across everything ‚Äî supply chain, where the suppliers are located, what the suppliers are doing for sustainability, and also then of course in the vehicle itself ‚Äî in terms of the type of materials there.

So - let's summarize - prices are rising at their fastest pace in almost 30 years and incomes just plunged by their most ever! We're gonna need more stimmies!""  

Plus  to above; 

Last year, Hirschman Capital noted that since 1821, 98% of sovereigns that hit 130% debt/GDP have defaulted on their sovereign debt.   

The US hit 130% late last year. 

Simple Conclussion : The Fed can‚Äôt go ‚Äúhawkish‚Äù and raise rates without sending markets ‚Äìand economies‚Äìto their knees; by extension, they now have nothing left to ‚Äúcut‚Äù when the current everything bubble implodes.

And that  is a *real problem*.

 There are only two ways for sovereigns to default: 

Inflation or collapse.    

The latter is not an option. 

 As for a solution, what‚Äôs so tragic is that the only option before the Fed is an even bigger problem‚Äîcurrent and inevitably more inflation. 

 That is, if the Fed wants to keep markets (and their job security) breathing, they no longer have the foregoing template of ‚Äúrate-hike-followed-by-rate-cutting‚Äù at their disposal, which means they now have no choice but to dovishly keep rates near the zero-bound indefinitely.

But the only way to keep rates ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù and nailed to the floor of time is to purchase otherwise unwanted bonds to keep their prices elevated and hence yields and rates repressed.

Such bond ‚Äúaccommodation,‚Äù of course, costs money, and as we already know, the only ‚Äúmoney‚Äù the Fed has to spend is the kind they create out of thin air‚Äì the very kind of money (and policy) which leads to the kind of inflation discussed above‚Äînamely, the brutal kind.

 As for that fake money, the evidence of the Fed‚Äôs desperate (and only) direction is now obvious, as the following M2 money supply makes equally clear. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v774ta55sw171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e73c839beb67a67eea9aed7de4ac61d86813840

 

Fed is so embarrassed by this ‚Äúprinting solution‚Äù that they‚Äôve stopped *weekly* reporting of M2 data, and frankly, since March, have even stopped *monthly* reporting of the same.

That, of course, is both telling as well as disgraceful‚Ä¶ The Fed literally has something to hide, and that never bodes well, does it?

&#x200B;

 The correlation to central bank balance sheet (i.e., money supply) expansion and rising markets is now beyond dispute. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sgizb6xcsw171.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=aad2fe681fe0c49ac20368aba77e86c118b22959

 In short‚Äîdo you see the correlation and pattern? Do you see how the Fed‚Äôs market sausage is made? More importantly, do you now see the Fed‚Äôs self-made conundrum? 

 

Given that the Fed bows to the markets not the people, which choice do you think they‚Äôll make?

In other words, expect more money printing and more yield curve control‚Äîand hence more money creation, more inflation, and by extension more fiat currency debasement.

 More money supply to keep rates monetized simply means more currency debasement and rising inflation.",nn51ou,"""Fed's ""Favorite"" #Inflation Indicator (PCE) Explodes At Fastest Rate Since 1992 As Incomes Crash By Record"""

I have leading indicators telling me that there are two concurrent shifts underway when it comes to who is purchasing homes.

\- Massive increase in unmarried people buying houses alone. This used to be somewhat unusual, now it's becoming very common.

\- Massive increase in unmarried men, in particular, buying houses alone. Traditionally, the female-to-male ratio of unmarried homebuyers was about 5 to 1. For the last 3 months, it's been closer to 50/50.

Source is my own closed real estate purchase transactions. Am a mortgage broker (btw this means cash purchases are ""invisible"" to me). It takes 3-6 months for [HMDA data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Mortgage_Disclosure_Act) to become accessible to journalists and academics, and thus ""visible"" to the general public (assuming journalists deem it worthy of commenting on), but I can see the trends live in real time.

How would one go about placing a bet that in about 3 or 6 months, the media, journalists, academics, etc, will pick up on this, publish articles, and potentially cause a lot of people to buy certain stocks. Which stocks would that be? Is there a ""Mancave, Inc"" out there that would potentially get an uptick? Or maybe a company making smart-home stuff that is particularly suited to renting by the room (the single men are not buying 1 bedroom condos, they are buying proper houses with 3 bedrooms, etc)?

EDIT: oh, and to be clear. It's not just an uptick in single men. It's an uptick in women too, but a massive surge from the men. It used to be that for 15 banana sales, 10 are to married couples, 4 to single women, and 1 to a single man.

(Some context) purchased 1 day calls options expiring on 5/28: 10 26$ calls 10 27$ calls 10 28$. 
Note this was the retard‚Äôs first option trade so he was going bananas seeing all the fucking ü§ë tendies. The retard was bullish and let the stock run until it got smack down. Instead of rolling the calls and taking a profit he was hopeful and waiting for the stock to bounce back up. After AMC dropped to 31 then to 26 he said fuck it let it run till then end hoping for one last minute run.

If the shares are counted by votes which is supposed to happen on 6/2/21, then all the Hedgefunds have to do is not vote, right? How does share voting/count work? 

How will they prove that synthetic shares exist if not many people participate in the count? Is it mandatory?

I have been doing research and talking to as many people I can that have some sort of experience/knowledge when dealing with the stock market. I heard about the potential to get into AMC and make some serious profit. I invested early on when shares were selling for around $8.00. I kept reading we need to hold until June 2nd and reevaluate. That‚Äôs my current plan, but hey I don‚Äôt know much about the game lol.

My current understanding of why there is a squeeze is because of previous events which backed hedge funds into a corner. Basically the hedge funds have had to borrow shares to pay off debt to companies like GME. When borrowing those shares, hedge fund companies left themselves vulnerable because they have no more money to borrow to pay off their debt. So if everyone buys stock in AMC and holds it, then the hedge fund companies are forced to pay out. The more people that buy and hold their shares then the higher the shares are worth and over time it will pay a profit. 

Like I said, I‚Äôm new to the game and this is just my current understanding of how the masses can manipulate the stock market. Please comment and enlighten me on another view point or correct my understanding. Let‚Äôs all get rich and work together with the power of knowledge!

Regardless, prices for everything don‚Äôt go up naturally given inflation, or the degree of increase will vary wildly. This depends on the level of inflation observed, and where easy money is put into the system. In an investment sense, money shifts to safe havens. Therefore prices of risky junk bonds or stocks might actually go down as investors seek safe shelter. In other words some prices will actually drop as inflation shifts consumer or institutional $$$ between sectors. For ex, consumers might buy less purple dildos and more silver! Hehe 

Hope this makes sense. The idea is that some goods are indicators of inflation and some are not at all. You seem to understand the illusion of paper fiat and this makes me happy. Cheers GB",,

It was on a Thursday night 02/25/2021 when I posted, at the time RKT was around 19-20 range and on the following Monday 03/01/2021 it started rallying, by 03/02 & 03/03 it hit the ATH level 43. You‚Äôre welcome to find my last DD post for verification. And for those of you who made tendies on it congratulations to you all! Spread the good energy!

As I am writing this post Today is 05/28/2021, I‚Äôll try to bring more data and technical analysis on $RKT, as you all saw what happened yesterday 05/27/2021 around lunch time upon sudden move it went from 17.50 area all the way to 19.40. This move doesn‚Äôt seem so random at all, a combination of someone noticed this to be a strategic technical squeeze just testing the water after it being suppressed down for the past 3 months, and you can see how fast the shorts started covering all of a sudden.

Today 05/28/2021, at opening it shot up to $19.20 but the shorts came prepared for $RKT this morning with their analysts and news blasting numerous articles and downgrades from Morgan Stanley, Wedbush & Zacks, ALL AT ONCE. This is certainly no coincidence.

On the technical side, on the daily chart as you can see it has a gap to fill around 22.67 area then it‚Äôll go straight to 28 and has a huge potential to pass beyond that and make it to a new all-time high, there‚Äôs nothing stopping it. On the daily MACD closed red and turned green, RSI is at the same level as last time before it squeezed to ATH $43, Parabolic S.A.R indicator flipped from red on the daily to green for the first time in 3 months. Another important factor is as you look at the volume and candle compared to last time it exploded (both red arrows) same volume, same price action.

Conclusion: the shorts are basically scared sh\*tless right now and they know it, is a tickle to the trigger for it to explode again like last time or even higher. Based on Excess Returns Model the fair value for RKT is $85, so why haven't we seen $100 yet?

If we want to eat the rich we need to turn our attentions to the little company and I‚Äôm talking the small businesses that are building and thriving in the OTC land of pink sheets real penny stocks. Big hedge fund investors always say oh don‚Äôt invest in penny stocks they are scams well that is absolutely false back in the 90s when the PennyStocks were hot and the tech bubble was happening big corporate flooded the pennies with scam companies yes and then they outed them as well to cause panic within the PennyStocks causing massive sell offs and fear of the market. All this was caused on purpose to prevent the middle class from having a chance. But you know what started as a penny stock and came out of that bubble and survived to move on? Apple and Microsoft. They don‚Äôt want you trading pennies cause they don‚Äôt want the middle class to get ahead but the PennyStocks were made for the middle class so that we could grow and develop new businesses and so that the middle class could get ahead by making long term investments into companies that value their shareholders not pump and dumps. Big cooperations also don‚Äôt want those small innovative companies to become competition for them but look history repeats itself and these pennies have been working on their companies and have been developing innovative technologies for years they are making their moves and they are ready to help America into the future we need just start doing some research and you will see I won‚Äôt name any specific ones but there are so many amazing things happening in these companies and guess what they are only valued at .04 or .50 or some even .001 because everyone is wasting money and pouring it into companies that don‚Äôt need your investments whatsoever you are just lining the pockets of their CEOs when they dump their shares on you and the rebuy later and they do it again and you guys keep funding them. And guess what the sec will be removing every non reporting stock here in the next month or so making the entire OTC full of legit and growing small businesses there has litterally never been a better opportunity than now to eat the rich. Also you can‚Äôt get these stocks on robinhood or else many of you would already be on this movement in history. Where the middle class takes back America. Idk just my thoughts man,,

Everything looked to have gone off successfully. We are now waiting on the data and craft to be analysed and inspected. This will take a few weeks according to Michael Colglazier.
That being said he had already outlined the test schedule in the earnings zoom call.

1st test flight - may 
2nd crewed flight - June 
3rd flight with R Branson on board late June/July 

4th flight this will be taking the Italian airforce on a training mission (600k a seat) late July


On the run in to the first test flight some possible maintenance issues appeared with the carrier plane White knight 2‚Ä¶. 
This indeed could have gone either way , after 2 weeks inspections it was decided that WK2 did not need to delay testing no maintenance was needed at this point. Scheduled Maintenance will commence in the fall after all tests have been completed.
Upon this news it is my opinion that the testing programme will go ahead as planned.

The market has responded accordingly and the stock is now up from $17-‚Ç¨31

With all these catalysts lined up before the end of the year and commercial operations looming for early 2022 things are looking up for Virgin Galactic.The success of the last test flight the company have now proven tech and concept.

I had a look at $BB and assume that we finally formed the bottom. In the last few days we saw a sharp rise which might continue in the next weeks. If we can break the 12$ resistance, the next targets would be aroung 25-28$. 

Using Elliot wave theory we are probably at the end of the correction wave 4 and now began with the bullish wave 5.

Price targets:

\#2 25$

4254,,2021-05-28 09:17:32,t3_nmtt43,,wallstreetbets,"Trainline has taken a huge dip since the UK government's announcement of the plan to nationalise the railway network. The plan includes creating an online ticketing platform by Great British Railways which might have a huge blow on Trainline revenue. However, this platform does not yet exist and will probably take a couple of years to develop. Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed.

In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales.  Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%.

I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time  for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

4259,,2021-05-28 10:41:01,t3_nmuzzi,,wallstreetbets,"Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent of Modernas if not more. Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects) 

Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

Imagine if the spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize one piece to understand the whole picture it and helps modify your DNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates it can still recognize the virus. In contrast to using one portion of the picture as it mutates it's easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine, that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. Not only that but they have had the least amount of side effects of any covid vaccine deeming it the safest covid vaccine.... 

And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein (whole picture) and the safety profile. Also worth a mention is that you could store it in a regular refrigerator, and let it sit out in room temperature while you're vaccinating people instead of a special ultra low temp freeze needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers, this is a majority of the world. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines so other protein competitors will be far behind and they will have an a moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing they teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine. They will be combining flu and covid vaccine by 2025 for possibly double the price of current covid vaccine.

 They are pretty much de-risked at this point. Yes you could buy other  biotechs that can go up 20x but are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up) that has all successful trials done so far, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment to where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place there are no more glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""

They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. Yesterday at market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. 
 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

Future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract in there ( in the link below in another message). It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 

As far as my position I own some $200 July calls along with about 933 shares. I'm all in baby.  Been in since $4.06, I panicked and sold once during February a couple months during the mini bear market we had and got back in a bit too early so got a wash sale üôà but I'm diamond hands all the way to $800 from here.  LFG I expect to turn that into a cool million in a year's time via shares and options based on the DD provided. Just know this isn't all completely my DD some of this is taken from my good friends at the community Nvax community on Stocktwits. They're one of the most hardcore groups that provides excellent DD and are always willing to help each other a hand if anyone's got questions highly recommend to check it out. So my point is this is information collected over the months that is a group consensus on nvax future price. (Check out next link below this paragraph, it has My positions and an amazing DD chart converting contracts to future price and comparing with competitors. My screen name on stovktwits  is the same on there Johnnyknowsbest. Been on there and here since i started with nvax.

Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. This is huge as the combo is going to differentiate them especially since both flu and covid vaccines are first in class.

 And I've included a couple messages down below explaining more in detail about what I talked about in case there's any questions.

# SPY SG:

Looks like low volatility day. Play tight.

Note from SG: ""For todays expiration our models show about 15% SPX /30% SPY gamma expiring, which could allow volatility increase a bit into next week. This in turn may free markets for a push up into that 4250 target (Call Wall) area.""

Gamma Index: decreased to -0.1 (A large negative figure indicates volatility may be high. The range is from 4 to ‚Äì4.)

Vol Trigger: Increased to 419 (Important support and resistance level. (above this level = lower volatility and a more stable stock price.)

Abs Gamma Strike: Unchanged

Gamma Notional: Decreased to $-516 (stock has larger put gamma position. A negative gamma position implies higher volatility in the underlying)

Put Wall Support: Increased to 419 (If Put Wall shifts to a higher strike it could be a bearish indication)

Call Wall Strike: Increased to 425 (When this strike is rolled higher it is generally considered bullish)

Gamma Tilt: Decreased to 0.88	 (when decreasing it‚Äôs a bearish signal.)

Net Delta: Increased to 198k (positive delta position infers options market makers have a net long hedge.)

25d risk reversal: Increased to -0.06 (When the ratio shifts towards 0 it indicates call demand)

1) We look to the PTON CFO's statement found in the latest earnings call transcript, for guidance:
""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior.""
2) Being that we do not have access to a 10-K filing for Q4 fiscal '19, we will access other filings that do in fact reference numbers from fiscal '19...
A) 10-K filing dated 9/11/2020
B) 10-Q filing dated 5/6/2020
3) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $223.3M under Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19)
But, that is TOTAL Revenue; we need to find out what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike sales...
4) To calculate what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike Sales, we can use numbers from neighboring Q3 (i.e. Three Months Ended March 31, 2019)...
A) On page 6 of the 10-Q, you will find Revenue of ""Connected Fitness Products"" (aka Bike Sales) to be $261.6M
B) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $316.7M
C) % of Bike Sales per TOTAL Revenue: $261.6M / $316.7M * 100 = 82.6% {""Connected Fitness Products"" Revenue (aka Bike Sales)}
5) Apply 82.6% to the TOTAL Revenue $223.3M for Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19): $223.3M x 0.826 = $184.45M {Bike Sales for Q4 of fiscal '19}
6) Per the CFO, ""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior."":

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote... By mid-July, we‚Äôll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase precious metals  especially silver amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative 

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

Gold rose over 60% in the 1930s as the prices of stocks and real estate crashed. You could buy an entire block with a one ounce gold coin. Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms.

I must address Cramer's statement because he is obviously trying to add fuel to the short-selling fire: When he says ""we're not going natural gas"" he is clearly making a vague and general statement meant to be interpreted in the worst possible way: ""no one is going to buy or use natural gas."" By now, I hope everyone that is interested in this stock understands that CLNE offers an alternative transportation fuel, thus, the investments made by BP and Chevron, and not revolutionary technology like some EV's (but this is mostly hype meant to catapult EVs to the front. What most people do not realize is that driverless technology and such can be placed in Petro vehicles too). Also, unfortunately, the company has done a terrible marketting job. That's why powerful analysts can get away with making vague and unsupported statements. The fact that Cramer explained the stock's decrease over the last month as being due to widespread dissaproval is misleading, at best. Many people do not yet know about the cleanliness and therapeutic effects RNG has on the climate.

The News...

If you haven't read yet it looks like Federal Cannabis legalization my be around the corner. [Here](https://www.mpp.org/policy/federal/the-more-act/) is the House Bill. Supporters seem on board and like the reforms they have done to the bill including rescheduling cannabis. [Last time](https://mjbizdaily.com/key-us-house-lawmaker-reintroduces-federal-marijuana-legalization-bill/) the bill was introduced it cleared the House.   


Personally I think this gets a lot of support especially from a fiscal point of view. With stimulus stalling and a giant debate going on about how to pay for the stimulus I think cannabis offers the easiest way to collect federal revenue. A simple review of the bill and the fiscal benefits to the Fed's can be read [here](https://www.justtherealnews.com/congress/nadler-blumenauer-lee-jackson-lee-jeffries-velazquez-reintroduce-comprehensive-marijuana-reform-legislation/). The bill states a 5% fed tax. Money coming for uncle Sam, right when questions about paying for stimulus.... Personally I think it adds up, but that's for you to decide. 

Okay so that's the hype...

Let's talk about the tickers listed ($SNDL and $TLRY). 

$SNDL

I'll start with the cheaper YOLO, $SNDL. $SNDL short interest isn't high, but the company did issue convertible notes a while back around .7c if my memory is correct. I'm not saying they won't do it again, but they should be in a good place fiscally for now. Float is high with about 1.6B shares out there. However today's volume at the time of writing is over 415M. That's not bad given such a high float. It's about 200% more than the average volume. 

The options chain on $SNDL has me giddy. With over 200,000 options currently in the money on todays move above $1 there is some high potential here for some interesting action. The put to call ratio is just obnoxiously low at .08 it's screaming upwards betting. If we hold above $1 the potential squeeze up could be amazing.   


It's also broken up on the trend lines and out of the downward channel it was in. The regression channel from the peak squeeze back in Feb just broke out today according to my crayons I have laying around. 

$TLRY

$TLRY was the squeeze of a lifetime if you remember it back in 19'. The ticker was just a money printer with it's low float and stupid hype. Then they proceeded to do, like they all do, and issue debt. Shares tumbled since then falling from $120 --> $5. Ouch bag holders.   


Like all the cannabis stocks the Feb bump pushed $TLRY to above $60 in an amazing move. $TLRY has a lower short interest than $SNDL, but it also has a much lower float at about 300M. Compared to $SNDL the volume here isn't as good, but still remains decently above the avg volume around 36M as of right now. 

If we peep the options chain we also see a crazy low P/C ratio around .11. But we don't have the Open Interest in the chain like $SNDL does unless you roll out to Jun 18. Then we finally get some decent OI.   


Personally I am going with $SNDL. The option's chain looks better, the stock is cheaper, and the short interest is a little better. My advice would be to roll out till at least the Jun 11th $1 strike to not get eaten alive by Theta and IV crush. But WSB does what WSB wants and that's why I love you all.   
Do not go above the $2 strikes IMO. You will get crushed by theta unless we get an insane move, which could happen but I don't see the risk / reward there.",nn326f,MORE ACT / CANNABIS / $SNDL & $TLRY Potential

>A corner in the silver market has been tried before - and let's be clear, that is what is being attempted now.  In 1980, a rule change by the government destroyed the corner.  #silverthursday.

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday

>Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers‚Äô attempt to corner the market on the metal.

-
>Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926‚Äì2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers‚Äô Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.

-
>By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged‚ÄîMarch 27‚Äîsilver fell to $10.80, the metal‚Äôs biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, ‚ÄúA billion dollars isn‚Äôt what it used to be,‚Äù the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.

-
>To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978‚Äì91) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities.",nn36fw,There is no silver short squeeze happening.

Tl;dr

This is an extensive, in-depth due-diligence document, and I realize that ‚Äúain‚Äôt nobody got time for that‚Äù. So I have decided to do God‚Äôs work for him and put the tl;dr at the start, saving you all a couple hours read.

* Henrik Fisker is a God among men in the automotive industry - trust him to do right
* Geeta Gupta-Fisker is a solid Chief Financial Officer with experience in investment banking - she will ensure the shares are valued right
* Henrik has learned from all the mistakes he made with his previous attempt to create Fisker Automotive, and will certainly do everything in his power to avoid that mess again. He has designed systems into the intricacies of the company to avoid failure - meaning Fisker Inc is guaranteed to succeed
* Henrik Fisker on shorting $FSR - ‚ÄúYou will quickly understand that you stand to lose a lot of money if you show it against Fisker‚Äù
* Production of Fisker Ocean expected to start in November 2022
* 250,000+ units a year expected by 2025
* Partnerships with Foxconn and Magna Steyr, both giants in their respective industries, among others
* Large Fleet market in Europe gaining momentum, and 700+ Fisker reservations in this market alone
* 16,000+ reservations already. More than Tesla had 18 months pre-production
* Revenue streams include leasing automotives, servicing, selling emissions credits, selling insurance (like selling the pickaxe to miners, and selling the diamonds to the mine owners too, absolutely genius - Fisker are insuring cars which they own, because the customer is only leasing it)
* High short interest (20%+), high analyst price targets compared to current share price (100%+) and low valuation compared to peers ($3bn market cap currently)
* Designing the first ever all-electric popemobile - Massive, soon to be historic, event!
* I give $FSR (currently $13 a share) a price target of $100 by end of year 2022, if not sooner
* Price Targets: $35 by end of year - Previous ATH. $50 start of next year - European and Chinese debut of prototypes. $100 end of 2022 - start of production (SOP). $150+ 2023
* 2025 Price Targets, calculated using projected data: Bear case - $97 a share, Bull case - $519 a share
* Downside in the short term is capped by the large amount of cash on hand - one third of market cap is cash. Long term, is capped by risk factors, which are almost eligible and affect every automotive startup anyway.

In 2007, Tesla Motors hired Henrik Fisker to perform initial design work on the Tesla Model S electric sedan, which was introduced in 2012.

Fisker stated in 2018 that, with the growth of car-sharing, ride-hailing, and autonomous shuttles, he believes within 10 years private cars will be used for less than half of what they are currently used for.

## Fisker Automotive

In 2008, Fisker Automotive raised over $90 million from investors including venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. In September 2009, Fisker Automotive was awarded a $528 million loan guarantee by the United States Department of Energy (DOE). The automaker was one of four recipients of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, to encourage the domestic manufacture of electric cars. The funds were to be used to develop the Karma, as well as an affordable family-size plug-in hybrid car. The loan facility was frozen at $192 million in February 2012, after the DOE claimed that Fisker missed its milestones

In December 2011, just as the Fisker Karma was launched, its battery supplier, A123 Systems, recalled all batteries, followed by a second recall in 2012. A123 filed for bankruptcy in October 2012, leaving Fisker Automotive without a battery supplier. After selling approximately 2,000 units, production of the Fisker Karma was suspended in November 2012, in the absence of its battery supplier.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/59vfj5wa8w171.png?width=511&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1c03d1e1254fea00c195776122de2b26099dd35

Henrik Fisker resigned as chairman from Fisker Automotive in March 2013, because of disagreements with management about business strategy. Later that year, the company declared voluntary bankruptcy.Fisker raised and spent more than a billion dollars over its lifetime.The heart of Fisker‚Äôs business model was in that early deal with Quantum. The idea was to design a gorgeous car, and have suppliers like Quantum provide the technology because off-the-shelf parts from suppliers would help keep costs down.

But there were problems with this strategy: Sometimes, those parts had to be custom-made to fit the design vision, which resulted in higher prices for Fisker. Other times, parts were delivered late or, worse, faulty, but Fisker was locked in to those supplier relationships. Sources close to Fisker have also said that many of the parts were owned by the suppliers themselves, so Fisker didn‚Äôt own a lot of the internal technology.

The broker that raised funds for Fisker automotive, by selling their private shares, was Advanced Equities.It wasn‚Äôt until December 2011 and into 2012 that the more dubious efforts of Advanced Equities became clearer to Fisker‚Äôs hundreds of investors. The last few hundred million dollars of Advanced Equities‚Äô fund raising for Fisker, starting with the D-1 round, was what brokers call ‚Äúpay to play.‚Äù As Fisker was running into technical, delivery and political problems, its valuation was quickly declining. But the company still needed more money, so the brokers went back to its current investors and said: Unless you give this more, your current shares will be diluted and your preferred stock will be converted to common stock.

It was essentially a gun to their heads. This is why investor Wray sued Fisker in February 2012, alleging he was on the receiving end of this tactic. In his lawsuit, he says Advanced Equities sent him a letter dated Jan. 18, 2012, stating that he needed to decide if he wanted to invest in Fisker‚Äôs next round, and pay around $84,000 by Jan. 27, 2012 ‚Äî a little over a week from receiving the letter. He also says that Advanced Equities assured him that he would have anti-dilution protection. According to the audio clip from Advanced Equities‚Äô internal sales call in early 2010, Advanced Equity leaders say that the Fisker deal will ‚Äúsuffer no dilution,‚Äù and was ‚Äúa dream scenario.‚Äù

That dream would soon end. In September 2012 after Fisker closed on $1.2 billion in funding, the bulk of it organized by Advanced Equities, the SEC charged the broker with misleading investors when it raised money for another company back in 2009 and 2010 (Bloom Energy). Advanced settled, agreeing to pay $1 million, and its co-founders were personally fined. Two months later Advanced Equities closed up shop.

Later, A123 Systems itself went bankrupt, causing more problems for Fisker. Fisker claimed that A123 Systems owed it $140 million, but a bankruptcy settlement reduced that to a paltry $15 million.

Then there was the just plain terrible luck for the ironically named Karma: Super Storm Sandy wiped out 338 of its Karmas in storage in New Jersey. The cars first drowned, and then caught on fire ‚Äî salt water damage caused a short circuit that was spread to other cars by high winds, Fisker said at the time.

With all of this happening in public ‚Äî and in a presidential election year ‚Äî Fisker‚Äôs struggles became highly politicized. The company was mentioned numerous times in presidential debates and speeches leading up to the election. Republican nominee Romney called Fisker and other DOE-supported companies losers.

The company didn‚Äôt seem to invest substantially in technology innovation or tech IP, and seemed to spend a disproportionate amount on suppliers. For example, numerous sources have said that the company paid upfront for 15,000 of some of the parts for its planned 15,000 Karmas. It ended up only selling around 2,000 of the cars. It has also been said that Fisker paid some funds upfront to have BMW make engines for the 100,000 Nina cars it hoped to produce ‚Äî in the end, Fisker didn‚Äôt deliver a single Nina.

Costs to build each Karma also creeped up because the company missed its volume targets, and because engineering had to change designs around supplier constraints. The company ended up adding $20,000 to its initial sale price.

Expensive hires may also have sucked away chunks of Fisker‚Äôs funding: Sources say that Fisker filled the upper levels of the company with seasoned auto executives from Detroit. At the high point of Fisker, the company had around 300 employees, plus dozens of contract staff. Bringing in a certain amount of the old guard could help a car startup ramp up quickly, and also impress potential investors with ‚Äúindustry names.‚Äù But those people are also used to big auto-industry budgets that included extensive travel and salaries ‚Äî that‚Äôs the opposite life of a tech startup.

## Fisker Inc.

In July 2016, Henrik Fisker expressed interest in designing a fully connected electric car with autonomous driving features and an aesthetically pleasing look. He has pursued battery technology, and hinted at potentially reviving the Fisker name with a pure-electric vehicle using technology that nobody else has. Since then Fisker has talked about delays to the promised solid state battery technology, which he does not expect to be able to be produced in volume until at least 2025. Posing risk for competition from more scientifically experienced future solid state battery producers such as Quantumscape.

***Forbes:*** ‚ÄúNow he‚Äôs back‚Äìand three things are different. First and foremost, he has a vital new partner: his wife, cofounder and Fisker Inc. CFO Geeta Gupta-Fisker. Second, his Los Angeles-based company is public this time around, raising more than $1 billion in an October 2020 IPO. And finally, Fisker‚Äôs stock price, up 56% since its debut, has made both Henrik and Geeta billionaires, each worth about $1.1 billion as of Friday‚Äôs market close. The auto industry has seen father-son and sibling leadership teams, but Fisker Inc.‚Äôs CEO-CFO combo is the fast-changing sector‚Äôs first husband and wife power couple.‚Äù

Wealth isn‚Äôt the purpose of the new company, Henrik says. ‚ÄúI never got into cars because of money. (This shows he is willing to do what is in the best interest of the company because he is not motivated by money, unlike 99% of other CEO‚Äôs)

The couple sought a big stake in the new venture to ensure they can control its fate in a way Fisker couldn‚Äôt with his earlier company.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yzhded6pfw171.png?width=408&format=png&auto=webp&s=54b30259720cf853a8efeacf058f2f74315260b9

Henrik is an auto industry celebrity, but Geeta‚Äôs background is equally impressive. A native of India, she holds multiple degrees in science, including a Ph.D. in biotechnology from Cambridge University where she was also a Research Newton Fellow. From there, she started a career in international investment for Lloyds Banking Group, and then managed investments for a high-net-worth client for several years. (In particular, this is insanely important - Geeta **KNOWS MONEY**! She knows how best to keep a company afloat, organize its share structure, provide value to shareholders, etc. because she has worked in the industry before. She may just be the most important element of Fisker Inc., due to the financial experience she has. At every step of the way, she is likely to make decisions with one sole focus - increasing share price and value).

She met her future husband in 2011 when he was visiting London, just before things started going very wrong at Fisker Automotive. They married in 2012.

‚ÄúWhen I left Fisker Automotive, all I had was my car,‚Äù Henrik remembers. ‚ÄúI'm in a different position, mainly because of Geeta. Because she cuts the deals.‚Äù

To get the new venture off the ground, the Fiskers invested the majority of their life savings‚Äìan enormous financial risk given the fate of Henrik‚Äôs prior company. Then, just as they were locking in plans for the IPO back in July, they were hit by a highly unwelcome complication: Geeta learned she had early-stage breast cancer.

‚ÄúShe got the call (from her doctor) during a call with investors,‚Äù Henrik says. Despite that bombshell, she continued working with banks and investors in the weeks that followed, even as she underwent two surgical procedures and radiation therapy. Her medical therapy concluded in November.

Henrik, who marvels at her fortitude throughout the health crisis says, ‚Äúshe only missed something like one day of work...That's just how she is. She works tirelessly.‚Äù

## Fisker Ocean

The Fisker Ocean will have a nearly 300-mile range with an 80 kWh battery and a solar panel roof as a range extender, adding approximately 1,000 free miles of range per year. Advanced electronics will be housed under the hood, and the vehicle will incorporate recycled and sustainable materials throughout. Deliveries of the Ocean are scheduled to begin in 2022.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s87j6bdsfw171.png?width=438&format=png&auto=webp&s=e40add9ce53319d31db242cce73a303afb03cbab

Fisker has also announced a partnership with Electrify America to ensure Fisker Ocean vehicles will integrate seamlessly with Electrify America charging stations when the e-SUV hits the market. With features such as a solar roof and recycled inner materials, it will be, according to Fisker Inc., the ""world's most sustainable vehicle.""

In 2017, Fisker Inc. announced that it had filed patents on flexible solid-state battery designs. Fisker expected the batteries to be produced on a mass scale around 2020. A prototype of the battery debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018. In October 2018, Fisker announced new funding for battery development through Caterpillar Venture Capital. The solid-state batteries are intended to deliver longer vehicle range and faster charging times.

In 2018, Fisker was named to the board of directors of First Cobalt, a North American cobalt refinery that produces battery materials.

In September 2019, it was announced that Fisker Inc. was partnering with Game of Thrones actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who will serve as a partner and sustainability adviser to Fisker, to work on advanced, affordable, electric mobility models.

&#x200B;

[In addition to being a well-known actor, Coster-Waldau is also the United Nations Development Program Goodwill Ambassador for climate change and other social issues.](https://preview.redd.it/3hssff5vfw171.png?width=451&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebe55e2468c5b63d1bc0ac3c71547219dff5afaa)

Nikolaj wrote this piece about Fisker:

To quote a friend of mine who is a lot smarter than me, architect Bjarke Ingels: ‚ÄúThe idea that sustainability needs to sacrifice quality of life is a flawed one. It‚Äôs a design challenge, a challenge to build something that transforms the idea of sustainability into something that will increase the quality of life for all those around it.‚Äù

One person meeting that challenge is Henrik Fisker, who has designed some of the most iconic cars over the past decades for BMW and others, like the BMW Z8, Aston Martin DB9 and Aston Martin V8 Vantage. He‚Äôs a hero for gas-guzzling supercars. He is a fellow Dane, I am a fan, and we met, of all places, on Twitter.

When we met in person, he described his new project ‚Äî an all-electric luxury SUV ‚Äî and asked me if I would help spread the word on his car. The problem as I see it with most electric cars is that they only accomplish the basics. They get you from point A to B. They run electric so you don‚Äôt pollute while driving, but that‚Äôs it. They are basically unattractive combustion engine cars that have a battery thrown into them ‚Äî and for most of them, a battery with a limited range. What Fisker does is to try to make every part of the car in a sustainable and attractive way, like a full-length solar roof, recycled floor mats and vegan leather seats. It looks incredibly cool and inviting, with a great 250- to 300-mile range, and at a cost of just under $40,000, it‚Äôs a luxury car affordable to a mass market.

I said yes and even became an investor, not only because it‚Äôs a great car but more importantly, I hope and believe it can inspire other companies to actively incorporate sustainability goals into all aspects of their business. Fisker then had the idea of calling me ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù adviser. Which I am not. Just to be clear. Thanks Henrik, sounds cool, but I am an actor and a citizen, and that‚Äôs really it.

And what about Hollywood? Is our industry changing, are we at the forefront? Looking at social media, you would think so. And things are happening, but usually only when a camera is pointed at people. Remember a few years back when all awards shows only used EVs for the red carpet? We made a difference. We mattered. We showed the way. So cool. So green, so ‚Ä¶ brief. Now it‚Äôs back to the Escalade. But hey, we are not using plastic straws anymore!

To believe that change will come from Hollywood is not really based in reality (when did that stop us?), but we are great at reacting ‚Äî and things around us are changing, and changing us. I have a good friend who loves his SUV. It‚Äôs not electric. But he cannot give up his car. He is a good guy, he‚Äôs works for the U.N., so if he has a problem going electric, we all do. But if he is presented with an alternative that doesn‚Äôt mean a reduction in his quality of life, something like the Fisker SUV, I think he‚Äôd transition to electric in a heartbeat.

The IPO deal values Fisker Inc at US$2.9 billion, with an IPO share price of $10.

On July 30, 2020, Fisker announced plans for a four-vehicle portfolio by 2025. The Fisker Ocean SUV will be joined by a sports sedan based on their previously announced Fisker Emotion concept, a coupe-like SUV, and a lifestyle pickup truck. All will be electric vehicles.

On October 15, 2020, Fisker Inc announced it would be outsourcing vehicle production of its Fisker Ocean electric SUV to Magna Steyr, to reduce the complexities and costs related to the building and operating its own factory. Magna will start building the Fisker Ocean in Europe in 2022.

## Henrik Fisker Interview quotes:

I have people on Twitter saying, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just make the car next month? You have a prototype.‚Äù Most people don‚Äôt understand that it takes 18 months to do long-lead body tooling for high-volume vehicles. Most people don‚Äôt understand it takes two years to do durability tests and do all the engineering certification and everything else.

And on the business model itself, I believe that there is nobody in the near future or the next couple of years that‚Äôs going to make a million EVs on one model. Today, there‚Äôs nobody doing it. Tesla probably has the highest volume of one single model, a couple hundred thousand. But even the big giant established carmakers are not making, right now, a couple hundred thousand vehicles of one model. So the way you get volume, in my view, is if you partner up with other OEMs and share some of the expensive parts of the platform, which in my view is not anymore something that is unique IP or something that is a unique experience to the customer. An aluminum stamped floor or a steel stamped floor really doesn‚Äôt have any brand value anymore.

And obviously, as we move forward, we always start to do some of the things ourselves. But it was really about de-risking in our first vehicle to market. So we‚Äôre going to do another three vehicles, which we can do because we don‚Äôt have to spend all our money and effort on learning how to manufacture a car, for instance.

So we have programmed a lot. We have hired a head of ESG, environmental and social governance, and he is really spearheading developing specific... we kind of put out some goals that we would like to reach with suppliers, and we at least try to bring them in that direction. They are not reaching those goals right now, but they may reach them later. And then we have goals for ourselves. So for instance, we look at transport. Are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs closer to the plant, or are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs on the other side of the planet that way we have to then transport all that stuff. So those are the types of things that we‚Äôre really thinking about now as we‚Äôre nominating suppliers. And finally, materials as well, looking at sustainable materials. We‚Äôve actually picked up a lot of knowledge on that side as well, where we are adding more sustainable materials to our vehicle. So we are actually looking across everything ‚Äî supply chain, where the suppliers are located, what the suppliers are doing for sustainability, and also then of course in the vehicle itself ‚Äî in terms of the type of materials there.

So - let's summarize - prices are rising at their fastest pace in almost 30 years and incomes just plunged by their most ever! We're gonna need more stimmies!""  

Plus  to above; 

Last year, Hirschman Capital noted that since 1821, 98% of sovereigns that hit 130% debt/GDP have defaulted on their sovereign debt.   

The US hit 130% late last year. 

Simple Conclussion : The Fed can‚Äôt go ‚Äúhawkish‚Äù and raise rates without sending markets ‚Äìand economies‚Äìto their knees; by extension, they now have nothing left to ‚Äúcut‚Äù when the current everything bubble implodes.

And that  is a *real problem*.

 There are only two ways for sovereigns to default: 

Inflation or collapse.    

The latter is not an option. 

 As for a solution, what‚Äôs so tragic is that the only option before the Fed is an even bigger problem‚Äîcurrent and inevitably more inflation. 

 That is, if the Fed wants to keep markets (and their job security) breathing, they no longer have the foregoing template of ‚Äúrate-hike-followed-by-rate-cutting‚Äù at their disposal, which means they now have no choice but to dovishly keep rates near the zero-bound indefinitely.

But the only way to keep rates ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù and nailed to the floor of time is to purchase otherwise unwanted bonds to keep their prices elevated and hence yields and rates repressed.

Such bond ‚Äúaccommodation,‚Äù of course, costs money, and as we already know, the only ‚Äúmoney‚Äù the Fed has to spend is the kind they create out of thin air‚Äì the very kind of money (and policy) which leads to the kind of inflation discussed above‚Äînamely, the brutal kind.

 As for that fake money, the evidence of the Fed‚Äôs desperate (and only) direction is now obvious, as the following M2 money supply makes equally clear. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v774ta55sw171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e73c839beb67a67eea9aed7de4ac61d86813840

 

Fed is so embarrassed by this ‚Äúprinting solution‚Äù that they‚Äôve stopped *weekly* reporting of M2 data, and frankly, since March, have even stopped *monthly* reporting of the same.

That, of course, is both telling as well as disgraceful‚Ä¶ The Fed literally has something to hide, and that never bodes well, does it?

&#x200B;

 The correlation to central bank balance sheet (i.e., money supply) expansion and rising markets is now beyond dispute. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sgizb6xcsw171.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=aad2fe681fe0c49ac20368aba77e86c118b22959

 In short‚Äîdo you see the correlation and pattern? Do you see how the Fed‚Äôs market sausage is made? More importantly, do you now see the Fed‚Äôs self-made conundrum? 

 

Given that the Fed bows to the markets not the people, which choice do you think they‚Äôll make?

In other words, expect more money printing and more yield curve control‚Äîand hence more money creation, more inflation, and by extension more fiat currency debasement.

 More money supply to keep rates monetized simply means more currency debasement and rising inflation.",nn51ou,"""Fed's ""Favorite"" #Inflation Indicator (PCE) Explodes At Fastest Rate Since 1992 As Incomes Crash By Record"""

4298,,2021-05-28 20:45:08,t3_nn76we,,wallstreetbets,"TLDR:

I have leading indicators telling me that there are two concurrent shifts underway when it comes to who is purchasing homes.

\- Massive increase in unmarried people buying houses alone. This used to be somewhat unusual, now it's becoming very common.

\- Massive increase in unmarried men, in particular, buying houses alone. Traditionally, the female-to-male ratio of unmarried homebuyers was about 5 to 1. For the last 3 months, it's been closer to 50/50.

Source is my own closed real estate purchase transactions. Am a mortgage broker (btw this means cash purchases are ""invisible"" to me). It takes 3-6 months for [HMDA data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Mortgage_Disclosure_Act) to become accessible to journalists and academics, and thus ""visible"" to the general public (assuming journalists deem it worthy of commenting on), but I can see the trends live in real time.

How would one go about placing a bet that in about 3 or 6 months, the media, journalists, academics, etc, will pick up on this, publish articles, and potentially cause a lot of people to buy certain stocks. Which stocks would that be? Is there a ""Mancave, Inc"" out there that would potentially get an uptick? Or maybe a company making smart-home stuff that is particularly suited to renting by the room (the single men are not buying 1 bedroom condos, they are buying proper houses with 3 bedrooms, etc)?

EDIT: oh, and to be clear. It's not just an uptick in single men. It's an uptick in women too, but a massive surge from the men. It used to be that for 15 banana sales, 10 are to married couples, 4 to single women, and 1 to a single man. Now for the same 15 banana sales, it's 6 to married couples, 6 to single women, and 3 to single men, something like that.",nn76we,Homebuyer Demographics Shift towards single and male. How to bet?

I have been doing research and talking to as many people I can that have some sort of experience/knowledge when dealing with the stock market. I heard about the potential to get into AMC and make some serious profit. I invested early on when shares were selling for around $8.00. I kept reading we need to hold until June 2nd and reevaluate. That‚Äôs my current plan, but hey I don‚Äôt know much about the game lol.

My current understanding of why there is a squeeze is because of previous events which backed hedge funds into a corner. Basically the hedge funds have had to borrow shares to pay off debt to companies like GME. When borrowing those shares, hedge fund companies left themselves vulnerable because they have no more money to borrow to pay off their debt. So if everyone buys stock in AMC and holds it, then the hedge fund companies are forced to pay out. The more people that buy and hold their shares then the higher the shares are worth and over time it will pay a profit. 

Like I said, I‚Äôm new to the game and this is just my current understanding of how the masses can manipulate the stock market. Please comment and enlighten me on another view point or correct my understanding. Let‚Äôs all get rich and work together with the power of knowledge!

It was on a Thursday night 02/25/2021 when I posted, at the time RKT was around 19-20 range and on the following Monday 03/01/2021 it started rallying, by 03/02 & 03/03 it hit the ATH level 43. You‚Äôre welcome to find my last DD post for verification. And for those of you who made tendies on it congratulations to you all! Spread the good energy!

As I am writing this post Today is 05/28/2021, I‚Äôll try to bring more data and technical analysis on $RKT, as you all saw what happened yesterday 05/27/2021 around lunch time upon sudden move it went from 17.50 area all the way to 19.40. This move doesn‚Äôt seem so random at all, a combination of someone noticed this to be a strategic technical squeeze just testing the water after it being suppressed down for the past 3 months, and you can see how fast the shorts started covering all of a sudden.

Today 05/28/2021, at opening it shot up to $19.20 but the shorts came prepared for $RKT this morning with their analysts and news blasting numerous articles and downgrades from Morgan Stanley, Wedbush & Zacks, ALL AT ONCE. This is certainly no coincidence.

On the technical side, on the daily chart as you can see it has a gap to fill around 22.67 area then it‚Äôll go straight to 28 and has a huge potential to pass beyond that and make it to a new all-time high, there‚Äôs nothing stopping it. On the daily MACD closed red and turned green, RSI is at the same level as last time before it squeezed to ATH $43, Parabolic S.A.R indicator flipped from red on the daily to green for the first time in 3 months. Another important factor is as you look at the volume and candle compared to last time it exploded (both red arrows) same volume, same price action.

Conclusion: the shorts are basically scared sh\*tless right now and they know it, is a tickle to the trigger for it to explode again like last time or even higher. Based on Excess Returns Model the fair value for RKT is $85, so why haven't we seen $100 yet?

Everything looked to have gone off successfully. We are now waiting on the data and craft to be analysed and inspected. This will take a few weeks according to Michael Colglazier.
That being said he had already outlined the test schedule in the earnings zoom call.

1st test flight - may 
2nd crewed flight - June 
3rd flight with R Branson on board late June/July 

4th flight this will be taking the Italian airforce on a training mission (600k a seat) late July


On the run in to the first test flight some possible maintenance issues appeared with the carrier plane White knight 2‚Ä¶. 
This indeed could have gone either way , after 2 weeks inspections it was decided that WK2 did not need to delay testing no maintenance was needed at this point. Scheduled Maintenance will commence in the fall after all tests have been completed.
Upon this news it is my opinion that the testing programme will go ahead as planned.

The market has responded accordingly and the stock is now up from $17-‚Ç¨31

With all these catalysts lined up before the end of the year and commercial operations looming for early 2022 things are looking up for Virgin Galactic.The success of the last test flight the company have now proven tech and concept. 
Also with revenue now coming in Nasa who are conducting micro gravity analysis.
Also international training for military pilots and astronauts.
Commercial flights look imminent.
Space ports planned for around the globe and intercontinental travel looming.

I had a look at $BB and assume that we finally formed the bottom. In the last few days we saw a sharp rise which might continue in the next weeks. If we can break the 12$ resistance, the next targets would be aroung 25-28$. 

Using Elliot wave theory we are probably at the end of the correction wave 4 and now began with the bullish wave 5.

Price targets:

\#1 12$

\#2 25$

\#3 48$

4535,,2021-05-28 09:17:32,t3_nmtt43,,wallstreetbets,"Trainline has taken a huge dip since the UK government's announcement of the plan to nationalise the railway network. The plan includes creating an online ticketing platform by Great British Railways which might have a huge blow on Trainline revenue. However, this platform does not yet exist and will probably take a couple of years to develop. Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed.

In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales.  Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%.

I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time  for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

This is my first time making a post here, please do give constructive feedback and criticism.

4540,,2021-05-28 10:41:01,t3_nmuzzi,,wallstreetbets,"Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent of Modernas if not more. Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects) 

Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

Imagine if the spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize one piece to understand the whole picture it and helps modify your DNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates it can still recognize the virus. In contrast to using one portion of the picture as it mutates it's easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine, that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. Not only that but they have had the least amount of side effects of any covid vaccine deeming it the safest covid vaccine.... 

And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein (whole picture) and the safety profile. Also worth a mention is that you could store it in a regular refrigerator, and let it sit out in room temperature while you're vaccinating people instead of a special ultra low temp freeze needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers, this is a majority of the world. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines so other protein competitors will be far behind and they will have an a moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing they teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine. They will be combining flu and covid vaccine by 2025 for possibly double the price of current covid vaccine.

 They are pretty much de-risked at this point. Yes you could buy other  biotechs that can go up 20x but are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up) that has all successful trials done so far, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment to where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place there are no more glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""

They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. Yesterday at market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. 
 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

Future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract in there ( in the link below in another message). It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 

As far as my position I own some $200 July calls along with about 933 shares. I'm all in baby.  Been in since $4.06, I panicked and sold once during February a couple months during the mini bear market we had and got back in a bit too early so got a wash sale üôà but I'm diamond hands all the way to $800 from here.  LFG I expect to turn that into a cool million in a year's time via shares and options based on the DD provided. Just know this isn't all completely my DD some of this is taken from my good friends at the community Nvax community on Stocktwits. They're one of the most hardcore groups that provides excellent DD and are always willing to help each other a hand if anyone's got questions highly recommend to check it out. So my point is this is information collected over the months that is a group consensus on nvax future price. (Check out next link below this paragraph, it has My positions and an amazing DD chart converting contracts to future price and comparing with competitors. My screen name on stovktwits  is the same on there Johnnyknowsbest. Been on there and here since i started with nvax.

Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. This is huge as the combo is going to differentiate them especially since both flu and covid vaccines are first in class.

# SPY SG:

Looks like low volatility day. Play tight.

Note from SG: ""For todays expiration our models show about 15% SPX /30% SPY gamma expiring, which could allow volatility increase a bit into next week. This in turn may free markets for a push up into that 4250 target (Call Wall) area.""

Gamma Index: decreased to -0.1 (A large negative figure indicates volatility may be high. The range is from 4 to ‚Äì4.)

Vol Trigger: Increased to 419 (Important support and resistance level. (above this level = lower volatility and a more stable stock price.)

Abs Gamma Strike: Unchanged

Gamma Notional: Decreased to $-516 (stock has larger put gamma position. A negative gamma position implies higher volatility in the underlying)

Put Wall Support: Increased to 419 (If Put Wall shifts to a higher strike it could be a bearish indication)

Call Wall Strike: Increased to 425 (When this strike is rolled higher it is generally considered bullish)

Gamma Tilt: Decreased to 0.88	 (when decreasing it‚Äôs a bearish signal.)

Net Delta: Increased to 198k (positive delta position infers options market makers have a net long hedge.)

25d risk reversal: Increased to -0.06 (When the ratio shifts towards 0 it indicates call demand)

1) We look to the PTON CFO's statement found in the latest earnings call transcript, for guidance:
""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior.""
2) Being that we do not have access to a 10-K filing for Q4 fiscal '19, we will access other filings that do in fact reference numbers from fiscal '19...
A) 10-K filing dated 9/11/2020
B) 10-Q filing dated 5/6/2020
3) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $223.3M under Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19)
But, that is TOTAL Revenue; we need to find out what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike sales...
4) To calculate what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike Sales, we can use numbers from neighboring Q3 (i.e. Three Months Ended March 31, 2019)...
A) On page 6 of the 10-Q, you will find Revenue of ""Connected Fitness Products"" (aka Bike Sales) to be $261.6M
B) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $316.7M
C) % of Bike Sales per TOTAL Revenue: $261.6M / $316.7M * 100 = 82.6% {""Connected Fitness Products"" Revenue (aka Bike Sales)}
5) Apply 82.6% to the TOTAL Revenue $223.3M for Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19): $223.3M x 0.826 = $184.45M {Bike Sales for Q4 of fiscal '19}
6) Per the CFO, ""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior."":

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote... By mid-July, we‚Äôll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase precious metals  especially silver amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative 

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

Gold rose over 60% in the 1930s as the prices of stocks and real estate crashed. You could buy an entire block with a one ounce gold coin. Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms.

I must address Cramer's statement because he is obviously trying to add fuel to the short-selling fire: When he says ""we're not going natural gas"" he is clearly making a vague and general statement meant to be interpreted in the worst possible way: ""no one is going to buy or use natural gas."" By now, I hope everyone that is interested in this stock understands that CLNE offers an alternative transportation fuel, thus, the investments made by BP and Chevron, and not revolutionary technology like some EV's (but this is mostly hype meant to catapult EVs to the front. What most people do not realize is that driverless technology and such can be placed in Petro vehicles too). Also, unfortunately, the company has done a terrible marketting job. That's why powerful analysts can get away with making vague and unsupported statements. The fact that Cramer explained the stock's decrease over the last month as being due to widespread dissaproval is misleading, at best. Many people do not yet know about the cleanliness and therapeutic effects RNG has on the climate.

The News...

If you haven't read yet it looks like Federal Cannabis legalization my be around the corner. [Here](https://www.mpp.org/policy/federal/the-more-act/) is the House Bill. Supporters seem on board and like the reforms they have done to the bill including rescheduling cannabis. [Last time](https://mjbizdaily.com/key-us-house-lawmaker-reintroduces-federal-marijuana-legalization-bill/) the bill was introduced it cleared the House.   


Personally I think this gets a lot of support especially from a fiscal point of view. With stimulus stalling and a giant debate going on about how to pay for the stimulus I think cannabis offers the easiest way to collect federal revenue. A simple review of the bill and the fiscal benefits to the Fed's can be read [here](https://www.justtherealnews.com/congress/nadler-blumenauer-lee-jackson-lee-jeffries-velazquez-reintroduce-comprehensive-marijuana-reform-legislation/). The bill states a 5% fed tax. Money coming for uncle Sam, right when questions about paying for stimulus.... Personally I think it adds up, but that's for you to decide. 

Okay so that's the hype...

Let's talk about the tickers listed ($SNDL and $TLRY). 

$SNDL

I'll start with the cheaper YOLO, $SNDL. $SNDL short interest isn't high, but the company did issue convertible notes a while back around .7c if my memory is correct. I'm not saying they won't do it again, but they should be in a good place fiscally for now. Float is high with about 1.6B shares out there. However today's volume at the time of writing is over 415M. That's not bad given such a high float. It's about 200% more than the average volume. 

The options chain on $SNDL has me giddy. With over 200,000 options currently in the money on todays move above $1 there is some high potential here for some interesting action. The put to call ratio is just obnoxiously low at .08 it's screaming upwards betting. If we hold above $1 the potential squeeze up could be amazing.   


It's also broken up on the trend lines and out of the downward channel it was in. The regression channel from the peak squeeze back in Feb just broke out today according to my crayons I have laying around. 

$TLRY

$TLRY was the squeeze of a lifetime if you remember it back in 19'. The ticker was just a money printer with it's low float and stupid hype. Then they proceeded to do, like they all do, and issue debt. Shares tumbled since then falling from $120 --> $5. Ouch bag holders.   


Like all the cannabis stocks the Feb bump pushed $TLRY to above $60 in an amazing move. $TLRY has a lower short interest than $SNDL, but it also has a much lower float at about 300M. Compared to $SNDL the volume here isn't as good, but still remains decently above the avg volume around 36M as of right now. 

If we peep the options chain we also see a crazy low P/C ratio around .11. But we don't have the Open Interest in the chain like $SNDL does unless you roll out to Jun 18. Then we finally get some decent OI.   


Personally I am going with $SNDL. The option's chain looks better, the stock is cheaper, and the short interest is a little better. My advice would be to roll out till at least the Jun 11th $1 strike to not get eaten alive by Theta and IV crush. But WSB does what WSB wants and that's why I love you all.   
Do not go above the $2 strikes IMO. You will get crushed by theta unless we get an insane move, which could happen but I don't see the risk / reward there.",nn326f,MORE ACT / CANNABIS / $SNDL & $TLRY Potential

>A corner in the silver market has been tried before - and let's be clear, that is what is being attempted now.  In 1980, a rule change by the government destroyed the corner.  #silverthursday.

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday

>Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers‚Äô attempt to corner the market on the metal.

-
>Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926‚Äì2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers‚Äô Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.

-
>By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged‚ÄîMarch 27‚Äîsilver fell to $10.80, the metal‚Äôs biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, ‚ÄúA billion dollars isn‚Äôt what it used to be,‚Äù the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.

-
>To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978‚Äì91) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities.",nn36fw,There is no silver short squeeze happening.

* Henrik Fisker is a God among men in the automotive industry - trust him to do right
* Geeta Gupta-Fisker is a solid Chief Financial Officer with experience in investment banking - she will ensure the shares are valued right
* Henrik has learned from all the mistakes he made with his previous attempt to create Fisker Automotive, and will certainly do everything in his power to avoid that mess again. He has designed systems into the intricacies of the company to avoid failure - meaning Fisker Inc is guaranteed to succeed
* Henrik Fisker on shorting $FSR - ‚ÄúYou will quickly understand that you stand to lose a lot of money if you show it against Fisker‚Äù
* Production of Fisker Ocean expected to start in November 2022
* 250,000+ units a year expected by 2025
* Partnerships with Foxconn and Magna Steyr, both giants in their respective industries, among others
* Large Fleet market in Europe gaining momentum, and 700+ Fisker reservations in this market alone
* 16,000+ reservations already. More than Tesla had 18 months pre-production
* Revenue streams include leasing automotives, servicing, selling emissions credits, selling insurance (like selling the pickaxe to miners, and selling the diamonds to the mine owners too, absolutely genius - Fisker are insuring cars which they own, because the customer is only leasing it)
* High short interest (20%+), high analyst price targets compared to current share price (100%+) and low valuation compared to peers ($3bn market cap currently)
* Designing the first ever all-electric popemobile - Massive, soon to be historic, event!
* I give $FSR (currently $13 a share) a price target of $100 by end of year 2022, if not sooner
* Price Targets: $35 by end of year - Previous ATH. $50 start of next year - European and Chinese debut of prototypes. $100 end of 2022 - start of production (SOP). $150+ 2023
* 2025 Price Targets, calculated using projected data: Bear case - $97 a share, Bull case - $519 a share
* Downside in the short term is capped by the large amount of cash on hand - one third of market cap is cash. Long term, is capped by risk factors, which are almost eligible and affect every automotive startup anyway.

## Fisker Automotive

In 2008, Fisker Automotive raised over $90 million from investors including venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. In September 2009, Fisker Automotive was awarded a $528 million loan guarantee by the United States Department of Energy (DOE). The automaker was one of four recipients of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, to encourage the domestic manufacture of electric cars. The funds were to be used to develop the Karma, as well as an affordable family-size plug-in hybrid car. The loan facility was frozen at $192 million in February 2012, after the DOE claimed that Fisker missed its milestones

In December 2011, just as the Fisker Karma was launched, its battery supplier, A123 Systems, recalled all batteries, followed by a second recall in 2012. A123 filed for bankruptcy in October 2012, leaving Fisker Automotive without a battery supplier. After selling approximately 2,000 units, production of the Fisker Karma was suspended in November 2012, in the absence of its battery supplier.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/59vfj5wa8w171.png?width=511&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1c03d1e1254fea00c195776122de2b26099dd35

Henrik Fisker resigned as chairman from Fisker Automotive in March 2013, because of disagreements with management about business strategy. Later that year, the company declared voluntary bankruptcy.Fisker raised and spent more than a billion dollars over its lifetime.The heart of Fisker‚Äôs business model was in that early deal with Quantum. The idea was to design a gorgeous car, and have suppliers like Quantum provide the technology because off-the-shelf parts from suppliers would help keep costs down.

But there were problems with this strategy: Sometimes, those parts had to be custom-made to fit the design vision, which resulted in higher prices for Fisker. Other times, parts were delivered late or, worse, faulty, but Fisker was locked in to those supplier relationships. Sources close to Fisker have also said that many of the parts were owned by the suppliers themselves, so Fisker didn‚Äôt own a lot of the internal technology.

The broker that raised funds for Fisker automotive, by selling their private shares, was Advanced Equities.It wasn‚Äôt until December 2011 and into 2012 that the more dubious efforts of Advanced Equities became clearer to Fisker‚Äôs hundreds of investors. The last few hundred million dollars of Advanced Equities‚Äô fund raising for Fisker, starting with the D-1 round, was what brokers call ‚Äúpay to play.‚Äù As Fisker was running into technical, delivery and political problems, its valuation was quickly declining. But the company still needed more money, so the brokers went back to its current investors and said: Unless you give this more, your current shares will be diluted and your preferred stock will be converted to common stock.

It was essentially a gun to their heads. This is why investor Wray sued Fisker in February 2012, alleging he was on the receiving end of this tactic. In his lawsuit, he says Advanced Equities sent him a letter dated Jan. 18, 2012, stating that he needed to decide if he wanted to invest in Fisker‚Äôs next round, and pay around $84,000 by Jan. 27, 2012 ‚Äî a little over a week from receiving the letter. He also says that Advanced Equities assured him that he would have anti-dilution protection. According to the audio clip from Advanced Equities‚Äô internal sales call in early 2010, Advanced Equity leaders say that the Fisker deal will ‚Äúsuffer no dilution,‚Äù and was ‚Äúa dream scenario.‚Äù

That dream would soon end. In September 2012 after Fisker closed on $1.2 billion in funding, the bulk of it organized by Advanced Equities, the SEC charged the broker with misleading investors when it raised money for another company back in 2009 and 2010 (Bloom Energy). Advanced settled, agreeing to pay $1 million, and its co-founders were personally fined. Two months later Advanced Equities closed up shop.

Later, A123 Systems itself went bankrupt, causing more problems for Fisker. Fisker claimed that A123 Systems owed it $140 million, but a bankruptcy settlement reduced that to a paltry $15 million.

Then there was the just plain terrible luck for the ironically named Karma: Super Storm Sandy wiped out 338 of its Karmas in storage in New Jersey. The cars first drowned, and then caught on fire ‚Äî salt water damage caused a short circuit that was spread to other cars by high winds, Fisker said at the time.

With all of this happening in public ‚Äî and in a presidential election year ‚Äî Fisker‚Äôs struggles became highly politicized. The company was mentioned numerous times in presidential debates and speeches leading up to the election. Republican nominee Romney called Fisker and other DOE-supported companies losers.

The company didn‚Äôt seem to invest substantially in technology innovation or tech IP, and seemed to spend a disproportionate amount on suppliers. For example, numerous sources have said that the company paid upfront for 15,000 of some of the parts for its planned 15,000 Karmas. It ended up only selling around 2,000 of the cars. It has also been said that Fisker paid some funds upfront to have BMW make engines for the 100,000 Nina cars it hoped to produce ‚Äî in the end, Fisker didn‚Äôt deliver a single Nina.

Costs to build each Karma also creeped up because the company missed its volume targets, and because engineering had to change designs around supplier constraints. The company ended up adding $20,000 to its initial sale price.

Expensive hires may also have sucked away chunks of Fisker‚Äôs funding: Sources say that Fisker filled the upper levels of the company with seasoned auto executives from Detroit. At the high point of Fisker, the company had around 300 employees, plus dozens of contract staff. Bringing in a certain amount of the old guard could help a car startup ramp up quickly, and also impress potential investors with ‚Äúindustry names.‚Äù But those people are also used to big auto-industry budgets that included extensive travel and salaries ‚Äî that‚Äôs the opposite life of a tech startup.

## Fisker Inc.

In July 2016, Henrik Fisker expressed interest in designing a fully connected electric car with autonomous driving features and an aesthetically pleasing look. He has pursued battery technology, and hinted at potentially reviving the Fisker name with a pure-electric vehicle using technology that nobody else has. Since then Fisker has talked about delays to the promised solid state battery technology, which he does not expect to be able to be produced in volume until at least 2025. Posing risk for competition from more scientifically experienced future solid state battery producers such as Quantumscape.

***Forbes:*** ‚ÄúNow he‚Äôs back‚Äìand three things are different. First and foremost, he has a vital new partner: his wife, cofounder and Fisker Inc. CFO Geeta Gupta-Fisker. Second, his Los Angeles-based company is public this time around, raising more than $1 billion in an October 2020 IPO. And finally, Fisker‚Äôs stock price, up 56% since its debut, has made both Henrik and Geeta billionaires, each worth about $1.1 billion as of Friday‚Äôs market close. The auto industry has seen father-son and sibling leadership teams, but Fisker Inc.‚Äôs CEO-CFO combo is the fast-changing sector‚Äôs first husband and wife power couple.‚Äù

Wealth isn‚Äôt the purpose of the new company, Henrik says. ‚ÄúI never got into cars because of money. (This shows he is willing to do what is in the best interest of the company because he is not motivated by money, unlike 99% of other CEO‚Äôs)

The couple sought a big stake in the new venture to ensure they can control its fate in a way Fisker couldn‚Äôt with his earlier company.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yzhded6pfw171.png?width=408&format=png&auto=webp&s=54b30259720cf853a8efeacf058f2f74315260b9

Henrik is an auto industry celebrity, but Geeta‚Äôs background is equally impressive. A native of India, she holds multiple degrees in science, including a Ph.D. in biotechnology from Cambridge University where she was also a Research Newton Fellow. From there, she started a career in international investment for Lloyds Banking Group, and then managed investments for a high-net-worth client for several years. (In particular, this is insanely important - Geeta **KNOWS MONEY**! She knows how best to keep a company afloat, organize its share structure, provide value to shareholders, etc. because she has worked in the industry before. She may just be the most important element of Fisker Inc., due to the financial experience she has. At every step of the way, she is likely to make decisions with one sole focus - increasing share price and value).

She met her future husband in 2011 when he was visiting London, just before things started going very wrong at Fisker Automotive. They married in 2012.

‚ÄúWhen I left Fisker Automotive, all I had was my car,‚Äù Henrik remembers. ‚ÄúI'm in a different position, mainly because of Geeta. Because she cuts the deals.‚Äù

To get the new venture off the ground, the Fiskers invested the majority of their life savings‚Äìan enormous financial risk given the fate of Henrik‚Äôs prior company. Then, just as they were locking in plans for the IPO back in July, they were hit by a highly unwelcome complication: Geeta learned she had early-stage breast cancer.

‚ÄúShe got the call (from her doctor) during a call with investors,‚Äù Henrik says. Despite that bombshell, she continued working with banks and investors in the weeks that followed, even as she underwent two surgical procedures and radiation therapy. Her medical therapy concluded in November.

Henrik, who marvels at her fortitude throughout the health crisis says, ‚Äúshe only missed something like one day of work...That's just how she is. She works tirelessly.‚Äù

## Fisker Ocean

The Fisker Ocean will have a nearly 300-mile range with an 80 kWh battery and a solar panel roof as a range extender, adding approximately 1,000 free miles of range per year. Advanced electronics will be housed under the hood, and the vehicle will incorporate recycled and sustainable materials throughout. Deliveries of the Ocean are scheduled to begin in 2022.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s87j6bdsfw171.png?width=438&format=png&auto=webp&s=e40add9ce53319d31db242cce73a303afb03cbab

Fisker has also announced a partnership with Electrify America to ensure Fisker Ocean vehicles will integrate seamlessly with Electrify America charging stations when the e-SUV hits the market. With features such as a solar roof and recycled inner materials, it will be, according to Fisker Inc., the ""world's most sustainable vehicle.""

In 2017, Fisker Inc. announced that it had filed patents on flexible solid-state battery designs. Fisker expected the batteries to be produced on a mass scale around 2020. A prototype of the battery debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018. In October 2018, Fisker announced new funding for battery development through Caterpillar Venture Capital. The solid-state batteries are intended to deliver longer vehicle range and faster charging times.

In 2018, Fisker was named to the board of directors of First Cobalt, a North American cobalt refinery that produces battery materials.

In September 2019, it was announced that Fisker Inc. was partnering with Game of Thrones actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who will serve as a partner and sustainability adviser to Fisker, to work on advanced, affordable, electric mobility models.

&#x200B;

[In addition to being a well-known actor, Coster-Waldau is also the United Nations Development Program Goodwill Ambassador for climate change and other social issues.](https://preview.redd.it/3hssff5vfw171.png?width=451&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebe55e2468c5b63d1bc0ac3c71547219dff5afaa)

Nikolaj wrote this piece about Fisker:

To quote a friend of mine who is a lot smarter than me, architect Bjarke Ingels: ‚ÄúThe idea that sustainability needs to sacrifice quality of life is a flawed one. It‚Äôs a design challenge, a challenge to build something that transforms the idea of sustainability into something that will increase the quality of life for all those around it.‚Äù

One person meeting that challenge is Henrik Fisker, who has designed some of the most iconic cars over the past decades for BMW and others, like the BMW Z8, Aston Martin DB9 and Aston Martin V8 Vantage. He‚Äôs a hero for gas-guzzling supercars. He is a fellow Dane, I am a fan, and we met, of all places, on Twitter.

When we met in person, he described his new project ‚Äî an all-electric luxury SUV ‚Äî and asked me if I would help spread the word on his car. The problem as I see it with most electric cars is that they only accomplish the basics. They get you from point A to B. They run electric so you don‚Äôt pollute while driving, but that‚Äôs it. They are basically unattractive combustion engine cars that have a battery thrown into them ‚Äî and for most of them, a battery with a limited range. What Fisker does is to try to make every part of the car in a sustainable and attractive way, like a full-length solar roof, recycled floor mats and vegan leather seats. It looks incredibly cool and inviting, with a great 250- to 300-mile range, and at a cost of just under $40,000, it‚Äôs a luxury car affordable to a mass market.

I said yes and even became an investor, not only because it‚Äôs a great car but more importantly, I hope and believe it can inspire other companies to actively incorporate sustainability goals into all aspects of their business. Fisker then had the idea of calling me ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù adviser. Which I am not. Just to be clear. Thanks Henrik, sounds cool, but I am an actor and a citizen, and that‚Äôs really it.

And what about Hollywood? Is our industry changing, are we at the forefront? Looking at social media, you would think so. And things are happening, but usually only when a camera is pointed at people. Remember a few years back when all awards shows only used EVs for the red carpet? We made a difference. We mattered. We showed the way. So cool. So green, so ‚Ä¶ brief. Now it‚Äôs back to the Escalade. But hey, we are not using plastic straws anymore!

To believe that change will come from Hollywood is not really based in reality (when did that stop us?), but we are great at reacting ‚Äî and things around us are changing, and changing us. I have a good friend who loves his SUV. It‚Äôs not electric. But he cannot give up his car. He is a good guy, he‚Äôs works for the U.N., so if he has a problem going electric, we all do. But if he is presented with an alternative that doesn‚Äôt mean a reduction in his quality of life, something like the Fisker SUV, I think he‚Äôd transition to electric in a heartbeat.

The IPO deal values Fisker Inc at US$2.9 billion, with an IPO share price of $10.

On July 30, 2020, Fisker announced plans for a four-vehicle portfolio by 2025. The Fisker Ocean SUV will be joined by a sports sedan based on their previously announced Fisker Emotion concept, a coupe-like SUV, and a lifestyle pickup truck. All will be electric vehicles.

On October 15, 2020, Fisker Inc announced it would be outsourcing vehicle production of its Fisker Ocean electric SUV to Magna Steyr, to reduce the complexities and costs related to the building and operating its own factory. Magna will start building the Fisker Ocean in Europe in 2022.

## Henrik Fisker Interview quotes:

I have people on Twitter saying, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just make the car next month? You have a prototype.‚Äù Most people don‚Äôt understand that it takes 18 months to do long-lead body tooling for high-volume vehicles. Most people don‚Äôt understand it takes two years to do durability tests and do all the engineering certification and everything else.

And on the business model itself, I believe that there is nobody in the near future or the next couple of years that‚Äôs going to make a million EVs on one model. Today, there‚Äôs nobody doing it. Tesla probably has the highest volume of one single model, a couple hundred thousand. But even the big giant established carmakers are not making, right now, a couple hundred thousand vehicles of one model. So the way you get volume, in my view, is if you partner up with other OEMs and share some of the expensive parts of the platform, which in my view is not anymore something that is unique IP or something that is a unique experience to the customer. An aluminum stamped floor or a steel stamped floor really doesn‚Äôt have any brand value anymore.

And obviously, as we move forward, we always start to do some of the things ourselves. But it was really about de-risking in our first vehicle to market. So we‚Äôre going to do another three vehicles, which we can do because we don‚Äôt have to spend all our money and effort on learning how to manufacture a car, for instance.

So we have programmed a lot. We have hired a head of ESG, environmental and social governance, and he is really spearheading developing specific... we kind of put out some goals that we would like to reach with suppliers, and we at least try to bring them in that direction. They are not reaching those goals right now, but they may reach them later. And then we have goals for ourselves. So for instance, we look at transport. Are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs closer to the plant, or are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs on the other side of the planet that way we have to then transport all that stuff. So those are the types of things that we‚Äôre really thinking about now as we‚Äôre nominating suppliers. And finally, materials as well, looking at sustainable materials. We‚Äôve actually picked up a lot of knowledge on that side as well, where we are adding more sustainable materials to our vehicle. So we are actually looking across everything ‚Äî supply chain, where the suppliers are located, what the suppliers are doing for sustainability, and also then of course in the vehicle itself ‚Äî in terms of the type of materials there.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nb8ozukrpw171.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd5a515f831dedcc57b25d717c5c133c0c74299d

So - let's summarize - prices are rising at their fastest pace in almost 30 years and incomes just plunged by their most ever! We're gonna need more stimmies!""  

Plus  to above; 

Last year, Hirschman Capital noted that since 1821, 98% of sovereigns that hit 130% debt/GDP have defaulted on their sovereign debt.   

The US hit 130% late last year. 

Simple Conclussion : The Fed can‚Äôt go ‚Äúhawkish‚Äù and raise rates without sending markets ‚Äìand economies‚Äìto their knees; by extension, they now have nothing left to ‚Äúcut‚Äù when the current everything bubble implodes.

And that  is a *real problem*.

 There are only two ways for sovereigns to default: 

Inflation or collapse.    

The latter is not an option. 

 As for a solution, what‚Äôs so tragic is that the only option before the Fed is an even bigger problem‚Äîcurrent and inevitably more inflation. 

 That is, if the Fed wants to keep markets (and their job security) breathing, they no longer have the foregoing template of ‚Äúrate-hike-followed-by-rate-cutting‚Äù at their disposal, which means they now have no choice but to dovishly keep rates near the zero-bound indefinitely.

But the only way to keep rates ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù and nailed to the floor of time is to purchase otherwise unwanted bonds to keep their prices elevated and hence yields and rates repressed.

Such bond ‚Äúaccommodation,‚Äù of course, costs money, and as we already know, the only ‚Äúmoney‚Äù the Fed has to spend is the kind they create out of thin air‚Äì the very kind of money (and policy) which leads to the kind of inflation discussed above‚Äînamely, the brutal kind.

 As for that fake money, the evidence of the Fed‚Äôs desperate (and only) direction is now obvious, as the following M2 money supply makes equally clear. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v774ta55sw171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e73c839beb67a67eea9aed7de4ac61d86813840

 

Fed is so embarrassed by this ‚Äúprinting solution‚Äù that they‚Äôve stopped *weekly* reporting of M2 data, and frankly, since March, have even stopped *monthly* reporting of the same.

That, of course, is both telling as well as disgraceful‚Ä¶ The Fed literally has something to hide, and that never bodes well, does it?

&#x200B;

 The correlation to central bank balance sheet (i.e., money supply) expansion and rising markets is now beyond dispute. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sgizb6xcsw171.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=aad2fe681fe0c49ac20368aba77e86c118b22959

 In short‚Äîdo you see the correlation and pattern? Do you see how the Fed‚Äôs market sausage is made? More importantly, do you now see the Fed‚Äôs self-made conundrum? 

 

Given that the Fed bows to the markets not the people, which choice do you think they‚Äôll make?

In other words, expect more money printing and more yield curve control‚Äîand hence more money creation, more inflation, and by extension more fiat currency debasement.

 More money supply to keep rates monetized simply means more currency debasement and rising inflation.",nn51ou,"""Fed's ""Favorite"" #Inflation Indicator (PCE) Explodes At Fastest Rate Since 1992 As Incomes Crash By Record"""

I have leading indicators telling me that there are two concurrent shifts underway when it comes to who is purchasing homes.

\- Massive increase in unmarried people buying houses alone. This used to be somewhat unusual, now it's becoming very common.

\- Massive increase in unmarried men, in particular, buying houses alone. Traditionally, the female-to-male ratio of unmarried homebuyers was about 5 to 1. For the last 3 months, it's been closer to 50/50.

Source is my own closed real estate purchase transactions. Am a mortgage broker (btw this means cash purchases are ""invisible"" to me). It takes 3-6 months for [HMDA data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Mortgage_Disclosure_Act) to become accessible to journalists and academics, and thus ""visible"" to the general public (assuming journalists deem it worthy of commenting on), but I can see the trends live in real time.

How would one go about placing a bet that in about 3 or 6 months, the media, journalists, academics, etc, will pick up on this, publish articles, and potentially cause a lot of people to buy certain stocks. Which stocks would that be? Is there a ""Mancave, Inc"" out there that would potentially get an uptick? Or maybe a company making smart-home stuff that is particularly suited to renting by the room (the single men are not buying 1 bedroom condos, they are buying proper houses with 3 bedrooms, etc)?

EDIT: oh, and to be clear. It's not just an uptick in single men. It's an uptick in women too, but a massive surge from the men. It used to be that for 15 banana sales, 10 are to married couples, 4 to single women, and 1 to a single man. Now for the same 15 banana sales, it's 6 to married couples, 6 to single women, and 3 to single men, something like that.",nn76we,Homebuyer Demographics Shift towards single and male. How to bet?

I have been doing research and talking to as many people I can that have some sort of experience/knowledge when dealing with the stock market. I heard about the potential to get into AMC and make some serious profit. I invested early on when shares were selling for around $8.00. I kept reading we need to hold until June 2nd and reevaluate. That‚Äôs my current plan, but hey I don‚Äôt know much about the game lol.

My current understanding of why there is a squeeze is because of previous events which backed hedge funds into a corner. Basically the hedge funds have had to borrow shares to pay off debt to companies like GME. When borrowing those shares, hedge fund companies left themselves vulnerable because they have no more money to borrow to pay off their debt. So if everyone buys stock in AMC and holds it, then the hedge fund companies are forced to pay out. The more people that buy and hold their shares then the higher the shares are worth and over time it will pay a profit. 

Like I said, I‚Äôm new to the game and this is just my current understanding of how the masses can manipulate the stock market. Please comment and enlighten me on another view point or correct my understanding. Let‚Äôs all get rich and work together with the power of knowledge!

It was on a Thursday night 02/25/2021 when I posted, at the time RKT was around 19-20 range and on the following Monday 03/01/2021 it started rallying, by 03/02 & 03/03 it hit the ATH level 43. You‚Äôre welcome to find my last DD post for verification. And for those of you who made tendies on it congratulations to you all! Spread the good energy!

As I am writing this post Today is 05/28/2021, I‚Äôll try to bring more data and technical analysis on $RKT, as you all saw what happened yesterday 05/27/2021 around lunch time upon sudden move it went from 17.50 area all the way to 19.40. This move doesn‚Äôt seem so random at all, a combination of someone noticed this to be a strategic technical squeeze just testing the water after it being suppressed down for the past 3 months, and you can see how fast the shorts started covering all of a sudden.

Today 05/28/2021, at opening it shot up to $19.20 but the shorts came prepared for $RKT this morning with their analysts and news blasting numerous articles and downgrades from Morgan Stanley, Wedbush & Zacks, ALL AT ONCE. This is certainly no coincidence.

On the technical side, on the daily chart as you can see it has a gap to fill around 22.67 area then it‚Äôll go straight to 28 and has a huge potential to pass beyond that and make it to a new all-time high, there‚Äôs nothing stopping it. On the daily MACD closed red and turned green, RSI is at the same level as last time before it squeezed to ATH $43, Parabolic S.A.R indicator flipped from red on the daily to green for the first time in 3 months. Another important factor is as you look at the volume and candle compared to last time it exploded (both red arrows) same volume, same price action.

Conclusion: the shorts are basically scared sh\*tless right now and they know it, is a tickle to the trigger for it to explode again like last time or even higher. Based on Excess Returns Model the fair value for RKT is $85, so why haven't we seen $100 yet?

I got a few hundred shares since it was cheap and looked like it was rising. I just logged on and it said the price had gone up ten fold which is great but it also says I only have 26 shares instead of roughly 260. I apologize if this is a stupid question but can anyone explain what happened? If it really went up that much and I somehow lost over 200 shares I got dicked hard. But since the money I have invested matches I'm just confused as to why my number of shares went down.

Edit: Solved and fast at that. Thanks guys for the quick response. Sucks that I'm out so many shares but I guess if my Investment is the same it could be worse.",nnclim,Question about ctrm

This would make it prime for a big squeeze due to illegal short selling, and market corruption creating synthetic shares). 

GME also has it's shareholders vote on the 9th June which is expected to be way over 100%. My personal advice is hold shares for now, but move to the stock with the highest vote count over 100% when the results are in, as this would be the best chance of a squeeze and will be the catalyst for other stocks to squeeze following it.

Processed soy is particularly bad. Whereas fermented, organic soy in small amounts (like natto) does not pose serious health risks, eating soy protein isolate will definitely take its toll on the body.

Some effects of soy include decreased libido, mood swings, depression, and several others.

This study from Harvard found that men consuming the equivalent of one cup of soy milk per day had 50% lower sperm count than men who did not consume soy. That includes even counting other factors like age, caffeine and alcohol intake, etc.

JUST WAIT. THERE‚ÄôS MORE.

This study found that soy stimulated the growth of estrogen-dependent tumors found in breast cancer. And this one found the same thing.

This study found that,

‚Äú‚Ä¶this pilot study indicates that prolonged consumption of soy protein isolate has a stimulatory effect on the premenopausal female breast, characterized by increased secretion of breast fluid, the appearance of hyperplastic epithelial cells, and elevated levels of plasma estradiol. These findings are suggestive of an estrogenic stimulus from the isoflavones genistein and daidzein contained in soy protein isolate.‚Äú

Soy is high in phytic acid, also known as phytates. These phytates prevent the absorption of minerals like iron and calcium (among others). This can be particularly harmful, especially for children.


Additionally, soy is high in phytoestrogen (source). This can block normal estrogen, wich leads not just to hormonal imbalance, but even breast cancer.

Note: this is why my periods were so heavy, painful and irregular when I was a vegetarian as a teen.

YEAST EXTRACT AKA MONOSODIUM GLUTAMATE (MSG)

MSG hides under many names and yeast extract is one of them. MSG is an excitotoxin, i.e. it overstimulates the nervous system.

If we want to eat the rich we need to turn our attentions to the little company and I‚Äôm talking the small businesses that are building and thriving in the OTC land of pink sheets real penny stocks. Big hedge fund investors always say oh don‚Äôt invest in penny stocks they are scams well that is absolutely false back in the 90s when the PennyStocks were hot and the tech bubble was happening big corporate flooded the pennies with scam companies yes and then they outed them as well to cause panic within the PennyStocks causing massive sell offs and fear of the market. All this was caused on purpose to prevent the middle class from having a chance. But you know what started as a penny stock and came out of that bubble and survived to move on? Apple and Microsoft. They don‚Äôt want you trading pennies cause they don‚Äôt want the middle class to get ahead and they definitely don‚Äôt want those small innovative companies to become competition for them but look history repeats itself and these pennies have been working on their companies and have been developing innovative technologies for years they are making their moves and they are ready to help America into the future we need just start doing some research and you will see I won‚Äôt name any specific ones but there are so many amazing things happening in these companies and guess what they are only valued at .04 or .50 or some even .001 because everyone is wasting money and pouring it into companies that don‚Äôt need your investments whatsoever you are just lining the pockets of their CEOs when they dump their shares on you and the rebuy later and they do it again and you guys keep funding them. And guess what the sec will be removing every non reporting stock here in the next month or so making the entire OTC full of legit and growing small businesses there has litterally never been a better opportunity than now to eat the rich. Also you can‚Äôt get these stocks on robinhood or else many of you would already be on this movement in history. Where the middle class takes back America.

I still think they are going to have a huge share buyback of over 14m shares (their buyback program was increased from 75m to 475m) in stock and add to the insider owned shares which is now at 54.80% over the week it has gone up about 2%. Which is a bullish signal. If 14m shares were bought that would leave about 51m shares to be traded publicly and the insider owned share percentage would go to about 62% which would be a large driving factor in the price going up due to scarcity. Also the buyback would be large enough to trigger a massive buy and I would jizz my pants.",nmnbfw,*UPDATE* Why I still Think EXPI Is Going To $60 In 4-6 Weeks (up 10.59% this week)

[When we last left our hero,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrly28/the_legend_of_utheemperorofjenks_aka_ornamental/) he had just lost all of his rent money and what he could advance from credit cards on a failed Super Bowl bet, and a YOLO on ‚ÄúRhodium‚Äù that he ordered from a sketchy Slovakian Wish.com ripoff. Alas, it was, of course, fake, and he was broke and depressed. It might have been the first fatal case of autism. He thought to himself ‚ÄúAm I really that retarded?‚Äù Then, he realized ‚ÄúNo, it must be Oklahoma that‚Äôs retarded!‚Äù

So, [after a brief case of violent diarrhea from Oklahoma Grocery Store sushi](https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/lrslbb/psa_do_not_eat_grocery_store_sushi_right_now/), he was ready to hatch his plan! Uruguay! Yes, Uruguay. [He was going to move to Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lh5igx/c%C3%B3mo_se_puede_llegar_a_melo_desde_montevideo_sin/)

His plans for this move could‚Äôve been anyone‚Äôs guess. One possibility he inquired about was [how to be a Tea Blendmaster.](https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/lfga0m/how_does_one_become_a_blendmaster/) [Another was him possibly reconnecting with God.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/lsij6j/agnostic_jew_seeking_faith_in_god/) Yet, he seemed to be asking questions about another topic more often than the others...

[Bees.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lxcnt1/c%C3%B3mo_es_la_legalidad_de_la_apicultura_informal/)

Specifically, beekeeping, a topic he admitted he had no experience in, [as evident from him looking for any book on the subject as an introduction months before.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/)

What he planned on doing with the bees was anyone‚Äôs guess, and I doubt he thought it through that much either. One post **AFTER** he took possession of 200,000 bees (we‚Äôll get to that later,) was [asking Americans if there was a demand for mead in the states.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/) So, was he thinking of importing Uruguayan honey to the US to be made into mead? Was he going to make it himself? Did he move to another continent for no reason? Let‚Äôs all find out!

A little more than 2 months ago, he finally did it. [He moved to Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/m9ejpn/la_paloma/) And about a week after that, [he was driving a truck filled with 200k bees across his new country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/) Based on replies in that thread, he was aiming to have [a monopoly on beekeeping in the country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/gt48gke/)

[He picked up his hives without complication.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mtkkf3/about_to_upsize_my_apiary_whats_the_best_layout/) [And then he settled into Melo, Uruguay, and set up his apiary ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/n1jnte/my_humble_apiary_near_melo_uruguay/). Life was good.

But, trouble was afoot. According to a reply, [the species he was planning on keeping had literally never been kept by keepers in Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mtkkf3/about_to_upsize_my_apiary_whats_the_best_layout/gv0viej/) And then, disaster struck. [He went to TIFU to post his tale of spreading an invasive species in an industry he knew nothing about.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/nmd69k/tifu_by_importing_bees_to_uruguay/)

Indeed, he had no idea even what a bee was until he stumbled his way through a book, and then decided to YOLO into honey in Uruguay. He somehow got in touch with an ecology professor in Montevideo that would help him set things up in exchange for grad students fucking with them every now and again. Oh, and the bees were from fucking Myanmar. Handshake agreement, of course. Total Chad move.

And like I said before, the rest went without incident for a while. It would take the bees ‚Äúa year‚Äù to make honey, so he just kinda hung out, stayed busy, and tried to find part time work in a foreign country he arrived in 2.5 months earlier.

And then, the professor ghosted him. Just disappeared. Shortly thereafter, government agents come out about this kid from Oklahoma illegally importing a non-native bee to their country. Apparently his bees had been fucking with other apiaries. So, he did probably the smartest thing he‚Äôs ever done.

He ran.

He fucking ran from the Uruguayan government, took a plane to LAX, and arrived with $14 to his name. His friend sent him $100, which wasn‚Äôt enough to go back to Oklahoma, so he took a $75 flight to Seattle, where he is also not from.

His last post is from a train out of the airport, with $39 to his name. I don‚Äôt know what is in store for him, but I know that $39 is as good as spent on urchin futures or whatever market he‚Äôs going to crash up there.

4897,,2021-05-28 03:12:37,t3_nmofz4,,wallstreetbets,"This started as a comment reply but I thought maybe people would like reading it. I've been researching Palantir since literally late November 2020 and I have nearly my entire portfolio in LEAPS expiring January 2023. So I have continually done more research on them this is just the basics to clear up confusion and help people who don't understand it because it's hard to hear all the hype and stuff. Also AMC to the moon tomorrow for my FDs I bought!! Don't judge me it's just fun to be in on the action on weeks like this.


So you should think of palantir as basically three companies and they actually are very far from unprofitable. 

They developed the really massive government software (gotham) specifically as a result of an interaction that happened to Peter Thiel while he was at paypal. They were losing millions to foreign scammers at paypal and the solution ended up being a high quality algorithm that flagged the most likely scam transactions and then allowed analysts to efficiently double check and verify the real scam transactions.

 It essentially was using what computers are efficient at (sorting through massive amounts of data) and then combining that with what humans are good at (looking at the more complex nuances that at least at that point computer algorithms were incapable of doing) and augmenting the humans ability to make complex decisions by rapidly sorting through the incoming data and bringing everything good to their attention.

They fixed paypals using this method and literally made the company profitable overnight because of fixing how much they were losing in the scam transactions. The FBI contacted PayPal and Thiel about using that initial software. That was literally his inspiration for what would become Palantir. He goes over it in huge detail in his book zero to one. If you make an audible account you can read it for free and find the chapter I'm talking about.

Then for 15 years they perfected the government software into the absolute nearly monopoly it is now in government intelligence augmentation software. The whole time though they reinvested almost everything for the last 10 years into building the commercial software (Foundry). That side of the business has only been live for a VERY short time and initially they literally didn't spend a single dollar on marketing their first commercial clients sought THEM out because of their insane reputation with the government. Foundry helps with supply chains and all kinds of other important data  insights. But if you want a recent example the NIH and the NHS both used Foundry to figure out how to best distribute the vaccine and vaccine distribution in the US and Britain has far outpaced expectations. You think commercial companies aren't going to be interested in using the software that was literally proven on a level like that?

 They're only just now adding huge amounts of people to their sales teams literally in the last six months which if you read Peter thiels book is insane for the stock because they have this crazy long term plan and he literally talks about how when they get to a certain point and start adding sales as a full sector of the company it means that is the company the company plans to BEGIN scaling. Meaning they're this big and they literally only just started on the scaling part. Which they've also said in tons of interviews if you're a die hard Palantirian like me. 



They actually also have the third side of the  business which is their actual like full AI for weaponization and war and defense for the government. Gotham is like helping analysts and commanders lead and even helping police or agents figure out what's going on. This other software is different. It's called Apollo and its only at the beginning too. It's like pure AI machine learning AI handles everything stuff. Go find a video called pentagon head of NSC briefs public on AI I think it's on the PBS channel on YouTube or some shit. Or you can listen to Joe Biden talk about how we're going to double our percentage of gdp spending on AI. The amount of government money that's going to go into AI as a weapon to compete with China DWARFS peoples expectations of how much large the market for the kind of software palantir makes is. 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201001005334/en/U.S.-Army-Research-Lab-Selects-Palantir-Technologies-Inc.-for-91M-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-Development

This is literally the backbone of everything AI that the government is about to invest in. Sure they're going to experiment with other research but if you do research you'll also find Palantir is the ONLY company that does anything remotely like this software that has anywhere near the kind of clearances like what is required for these contracts. They are currently a clearance level 5 and about to be the highest 6. The closest competitors are almost all a 3 or lower I'm not even sure if there's more than a single 4 and that stuff is crazy hard to get. 

But like again I'm an obsessive. I realize why people get so excited about the commercial side scaling and how it's very possible and can make them huge and it will. But I'm actually pretty sure the reason people like Cathy Wood has such a huge boner for them is that she realizes how MASSIVELY. And I mean MASSIVELY underestimated the amount of government revenue they will get from all this AI investing the United States and NATO are about to do. It's literally the next Manhattan project and they're absolutely going to be one of the biggest players developing it if not the biggest. I think it's funny because most people are pretty disinterested in the government stuff for Palantir but i really think the weaponized AI apollo stuff may be as big as anything could ever be. 




Also people got the insider selling stuff very very wrong. Tom Nash (love him or hate him I don't care) has a few really good recent videos where he explains it in basically full detail what was happening. The selling panicked a lot of retail investors during a time when the buying for growth markets had really slowed because of rate hike due to inflation scares and a ton of retail holders got scared and caused more selling and more people got scared because of that and sold and it really just was mass psychology in effect and a LOT of FUD and confusion. 

Basically a few executives karp in particular got billions of dollars worth of options that vest but literally expire so you have to exercise them which means you buy shares of the company at a strike price. Well because it's the company granting shares the strike price is literally 10 cents or something and these automatically have to vest at quarterly increments. So everytime karp was exercising he's actually buying shares. Like over 150 million in total maybe a lot more million SHARES not dollars. shares. And even those when he exercising he's buying shares technically from the company it ALL counts as profit on taxes and ITS NOT LONG TERM CAP GAINS ELIGIBLE. So over the last year plus this year he's essentially getting shares but the literal dollar value of those shares to the government counts as pure profit. So his total income which he's getting taxed at 40% of is in the BILLIONS yes billions. Because that's a lot to handle people that work for them actually automatically schedule sells of shares to cover the taxes so that there's no issue it's not even like him saying sell today and they do this.... TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INSIDER SELLING TO THE SEC. That's why it's automatically happening so no one can ever claim he's timing it. 

So listen cause here's where it gets important. The exercising of the shares counts as almost pure profits but remember he's receiving SHARES not dollars he doesn't actually get billions of dollars. So has to then sell SOME of the shares so he can pays taxes on that. Then when he sells the shares to pay the taxes for exercising he actually owes even more money if they went up from when he exercised. So everytime he's selling low its actually good for him because it's less ADDITIONAL PROFIT that he would owe taxes on.

 If he wasn't selling its because he thought it would go down even further and then he would actually owe less taxes overall. So if he thought it was going to tank he'd wait and actually get a nice fat discount on his taxes. 

I know this seems really crazy but I promise that's how it works you can look it up in detail but yeah shocking that mainstream media and redditors/youtubers who barely do research and have no real understanding of how these billion dollar compensations work would get it wrong. Unbelievable I know. If he had actually sold the massive overall percentage of his shares that some people claim he did the company would be at like $3-6 dollars not low 20s. Retail got confused because of market pressured due to interest rate fears from inflation and sold low (like retail always does) to institutions.",nmofz4,"Palantir DD if you want to understand company and it's history better (also insider ""selling"" explained in detail)"

What is Blue Apron?


Blue Apron (NYSE: APRN) was the forgotten step child, bad luck Brian, IPO of summer 2017 that priced below range and had the misfortune of debuting after Amazon bought Whole Foods. Since it‚Äôs debut, the stock has suffered dropping from nearly $150 per share (adjusted for a 2019 reverse-split necessitated to stay listed) to as low as approximately $2.00!


Why the Drop?


Management. Fucking. Sucked. The prior executive team essentially handed Chad Hello Fresh the keys to the kingdom, when they made the fatal error of betting that the ‚Äúhigh affinity core users‚Äù would be enough to sustain the business. For this reason, they cut marketing to nearly nothing and attempted to realize operating leverage by shrinking the customer base only to its most prolific buyers.

This was stupid. HelloFresh did the opposite, essentially giving away meals, and they used it to stockpile market share. Put a chart up of HelloFresh customers against Blue Apron. You‚Äôll see the two lines converge and a clear indication that HelloFresh stole most of their business. HelloFresh was one of the best trades of the past 5 years. Look at the chart, look at the sales, and look at the margins. They have managed to achieve operating leverage by employing affordable pricing and emphasizing retention.


Blue Apron Might Go Under....


Today the company is in a dire place. Languishing away in Micro Cap hell at an $80M market cap, no one on Wall Street wants to cover these guys. Only their bankers, CG and MS, write them research and neither are overly optimistic. They‚Äôre in a shit spot with a credit line that mandates they keep $15M cash at all times, and they keep their customer base above 300K (thus far, they‚Äôve struggled). They‚Äôre sitting on $29M and burn enough cash per Q that they might go below that $15M level (wouldn‚Äôt be a first). All signs are negative...


But I Think They Might Win


Blue Apron is under new management. Linda Kozlowski, is the former COO of ETSY and an ex-strategist at Alibaba. She believes HelloFresh did things right and she wants to right the ship. Her ballsy-ass plan is to ride the line on cash and go all in on customer growth. She realizes those customers are worth a lot more than income on the P&L, and that she needs to make the pot as big as she can. Thus far, it‚Äôs worked. Customers are up over 20% in the past two periods and retention rates are rising. We are seeing signs of operating leverage, and it opens a big possibility.


My Prediction

Management is buying shares. They know the company is not healthy. The only logic is that they have a plan that‚Äôs working. You can‚Äôt sell a dying business with a shrinking share, but you can certainly sell a growing community, that could be an accretive asset to a better capitalized entity. I think Linda is going either get the business in a position where it can refinance for better terms, or where it can be sold to create shareholder value via a strategic alternative.

If that happen, given this is priced for bankruptcy and ignored by the Street, the returns could easily reach the triple digits. I‚Äôm long and I plan to add on additional weakness.

Everyone is talking about how the squeeze didn't even happen and the shorts didn't cover yet. What I don't understand is why wouldn't that be possible? If short interest is 17%, so let's round up to about 100M shares. Today the volume traded was 700M shares. Couldn't 100M of those 700M have been the shorts covering? And if they didn't cover, today alone 700M shares were traded, why would 100M shares bought by shorts cause a squeeze if today 700M were traded?

I have been having this question for awhile, since I noticed the same with GME. In the days preceding January 28th (when GME reached its peak), the combined volume was several times the amount of float. How come the squeeze happened and why did it happen? If the volume was so high, couldn't the shorts have covered in the days preceding that?

The infrastructure is actually there for H2 via pipelines.  Its quite brilliant actually that they can tie into existing NG infrastructure.  At one time in the 1800s America used Hydrogen as a fuel source.

These times are amazing for what the future can hold.  Im quite optimistic that one day everyone will have all the power they want very cheaply.  Batteries are great and portable, but I have some reservations about wide scale adoption (worldwide)  They are disposable, prone to danger, made from materials that are unsustainable.  At least in its present state.  No doubt there will be millions of battery operated vehicles in the next decade, but I think ICE can still and should be a viable option.

Think of an apartment complex.  Hundreds of people needing to charge at the same time (for work or school) it would be a disaster if they dont get things figured out.

Also, I hope H2 can be made locally and tie into the grid.  That is somewhat of a pipe dream but wouldnt it be cool if you powered your home and made your own gas for driving?  While feeding back into the grid for others.

H2 incidently has been around longer than battery tech.  Check this out (bottom of the page is the oldest H2 cars):
https://www.hydrogencarsnow.com/index.php/1807-1986/

There is a major misconception that H2 is some a new and novel concept.  But its been with us for centuries.  Decades ago, car manufacturers tried to make it a thing but incidently the oil people you spoke of kept it from being mainstream.

I still think they are going to have a huge share buyback of over 14m shares (their buyback program was increased from 75m to 475m) in stock and add to the insider owned shares which is now at 54.80% over the week it has gone up about 2%. Which is a bullish signal. If 14m shares were bought that would leave about 51m shares to be traded publicly and the insider owned share percentage would go to about 62% which would be a large driving factor in the price going up due to scarcity. Also the buyback would be large enough to trigger a massive buy and I would jizz my pants.",nmnbfw,*UPDATE* Why I still Think EXPI Is Going To $60 In 4-6 Weeks (up 10.59% this week)

[When we last left our hero,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrly28/the_legend_of_utheemperorofjenks_aka_ornamental/) he had just lost all of his rent money and what he could advance from credit cards on a failed Super Bowl bet, and a YOLO on ‚ÄúRhodium‚Äù that he ordered from a sketchy Slovakian Wish.com ripoff. Alas, it was, of course, fake, and he was broke and depressed. It might have been the first fatal case of autism. He thought to himself ‚ÄúAm I really that retarded?‚Äù Then, he realized ‚ÄúNo, it must be Oklahoma that‚Äôs retarded!‚Äù

So, [after a brief case of violent diarrhea from Oklahoma Grocery Store sushi](https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/lrslbb/psa_do_not_eat_grocery_store_sushi_right_now/), he was ready to hatch his plan!

His plans for this move could‚Äôve been anyone‚Äôs guess. One possibility he inquired about was [how to be a Tea Blendmaster.](https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/lfga0m/how_does_one_become_a_blendmaster/) [Another was him possibly reconnecting with God.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/lsij6j/agnostic_jew_seeking_faith_in_god/) Yet, he seemed to be asking questions about another topic more often than the others...

[Bees.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lxcnt1/c%C3%B3mo_es_la_legalidad_de_la_apicultura_informal/)

Specifically, beekeeping, a topic he admitted he had no experience in, [as evident from him looking for any book on the subject as an introduction months before.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/)

What he planned on doing with the bees was anyone‚Äôs guess, and I doubt he thought it through that much either. One post **AFTER** he took possession of 200,000 bees (we‚Äôll get to that later,) was [asking Americans if there was a demand for mead in the states.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/) So, was he thinking of importing Uruguayan honey to the US to be made into mead? Was he going to make it himself? Did he move to another continent for no reason? Let‚Äôs all find out!

A little more than 2 months ago, he finally did it. [He moved to Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/m9ejpn/la_paloma/) And about a week after that, [he was driving a truck filled with 200k bees across his new country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/) Based on replies in that thread, he was aiming to have [a monopoly on beekeeping in the country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/gt48gke/)

[He picked up his hives without complication.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mtkkf3/about_to_upsize_my_apiary_whats_the_best_layout/) [And then he settled into Melo, Uruguay, and set up his apiary ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/n1jnte/my_humble_apiary_near_melo_uruguay/). Life was good.

But, trouble was afoot. According to a reply, [the species he was planning on keeping had literally never been kept by keepers in Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mtkkf3/about_to_upsize_my_apiary_whats_the_best_layout/gv0viej/) And then, disaster struck. [He went to TIFU to post his tale of spreading an invasive species in an industry he knew nothing about.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/nmd69k/tifu_by_importing_bees_to_uruguay/)

Indeed, he had no idea even what a bee was until he stumbled his way through a book, and then decided to YOLO into honey in Uruguay. He somehow got in touch with an ecology professor in Montevideo that would help him set things up in exchange for grad students fucking with them every now and again. Oh, and the bees were from fucking Myanmar. Handshake agreement, of course. Total Chad move.

And like I said before, the rest went without incident for a while. It would take the bees ‚Äúa year‚Äù to make honey, so he just kinda hung out, stayed busy, and tried to find part time work in a foreign country he arrived in 2.5 months earlier.

And then, the professor ghosted him. Just disappeared. Shortly thereafter, government agents come out about this kid from Oklahoma illegally importing a non-native bee to their country. Apparently his bees had been fucking with other apiaries. So, he did probably the smartest thing he‚Äôs ever done.

He ran.

He fucking ran from the Uruguayan government, took a plane to LAX, and arrived with $14 to his name. His friend sent him $100, which wasn‚Äôt enough to go back to Oklahoma, so he took a $75 flight to Seattle, where he is also not from.

His last post is from a train out of the airport, with $39 to his name. I don‚Äôt know what is in store for him, but I know that $39 is as good as spent on urchin futures or whatever market he‚Äôs going to crash up there.

5060,,2021-05-28 03:12:37,t3_nmofz4,,wallstreetbets,"This started as a comment reply but I thought maybe people would like reading it. I've been researching Palantir since literally late November 2020 and I have nearly my entire portfolio in LEAPS expiring January 2023. So I have continually done more research on them this is just the basics to clear up confusion and help people who don't understand it because it's hard to hear all the hype and stuff. Also AMC to the moon tomorrow for my FDs I bought!! Don't judge me it's just fun to be in on the action on weeks like this.


So you should think of palantir as basically three companies and they actually are very far from unprofitable. 

They developed the really massive government software (gotham) specifically as a result of an interaction that happened to Peter Thiel while he was at paypal. They were losing millions to foreign scammers at paypal and the solution ended up being a high quality algorithm that flagged the most likely scam transactions and then allowed analysts to efficiently double check and verify the real scam transactions.

 It essentially was using what computers are efficient at (sorting through massive amounts of data) and then combining that with what humans are good at (looking at the more complex nuances that at least at that point computer algorithms were incapable of doing) and augmenting the humans ability to make complex decisions by rapidly sorting through the incoming data and bringing everything good to their attention.

They fixed paypals using this method and literally made the company profitable overnight because of fixing how much they were losing in the scam transactions. The FBI contacted PayPal and Thiel about using that initial software. That was literally his inspiration for what would become Palantir. He goes over it in huge detail in his book zero to one. If you make an audible account you can read it for free and find the chapter I'm talking about.

Then for 15 years they perfected the government software into the absolute nearly monopoly it is now in government intelligence augmentation software. The whole time though they reinvested almost everything for the last 10 years into building the commercial software (Foundry). That side of the business has only been live for a VERY short time and initially they literally didn't spend a single dollar on marketing their first commercial clients sought THEM out because of their insane reputation with the government. Foundry helps with supply chains and all kinds of other important data  insights. But if you want a recent example the NIH and the NHS both used Foundry to figure out how to best distribute the vaccine and vaccine distribution in the US and Britain has far outpaced expectations. You think commercial companies aren't going to be interested in using the software that was literally proven on a level like that?

 They're only just now adding huge amounts of people to their sales teams literally in the last six months which if you read Peter thiels book is insane for the stock because they have this crazy long term plan and he literally talks about how when they get to a certain point and start adding sales as a full sector of the company it means that is the company the company plans to BEGIN scaling. Meaning they're this big and they literally only just started on the scaling part. Which they've also said in tons of interviews if you're a die hard Palantirian like me. 



They actually also have the third side of the  business which is their actual like full AI for weaponization and war and defense for the government. Gotham is like helping analysts and commanders lead and even helping police or agents figure out what's going on. This other software is different. It's called Apollo and its only at the beginning too. It's like pure AI machine learning AI handles everything stuff. Go find a video called pentagon head of NSC briefs public on AI I think it's on the PBS channel on YouTube or some shit. Or you can listen to Joe Biden talk about how we're going to double our percentage of gdp spending on AI. The amount of government money that's going to go into AI as a weapon to compete with China DWARFS peoples expectations of how much large the market for the kind of software palantir makes is. 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201001005334/en/U.S.-Army-Research-Lab-Selects-Palantir-Technologies-Inc.-for-91M-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-Development

This is literally the backbone of everything AI that the government is about to invest in. Sure they're going to experiment with other research but if you do research you'll also find Palantir is the ONLY company that does anything remotely like this software that has anywhere near the kind of clearances like what is required for these contracts. They are currently a clearance level 5 and about to be the highest 6. The closest competitors are almost all a 3 or lower I'm not even sure if there's more than a single 4 and that stuff is crazy hard to get. 

But like again I'm an obsessive. I realize why people get so excited about the commercial side scaling and how it's very possible and can make them huge and it will. But I'm actually pretty sure the reason people like Cathy Wood has such a huge boner for them is that she realizes how MASSIVELY. And I mean MASSIVELY underestimated the amount of government revenue they will get from all this AI investing the United States and NATO are about to do. It's literally the next Manhattan project and they're absolutely going to be one of the biggest players developing it if not the biggest. I think it's funny because most people are pretty disinterested in the government stuff for Palantir but i really think the weaponized AI apollo stuff may be as big as anything could ever be. 




Also people got the insider selling stuff very very wrong. Tom Nash (love him or hate him I don't care) has a few really good recent videos where he explains it in basically full detail what was happening. The selling panicked a lot of retail investors during a time when the buying for growth markets had really slowed because of rate hike due to inflation scares and a ton of retail holders got scared and caused more selling and more people got scared because of that and sold and it really just was mass psychology in effect and a LOT of FUD and confusion. 

Basically a few executives karp in particular got billions of dollars worth of options that vest but literally expire so you have to exercise them which means you buy shares of the company at a strike price. Well because it's the company granting shares the strike price is literally 10 cents or something and these automatically have to vest at quarterly increments. So everytime karp was exercising he's actually buying shares. Like over 150 million in total maybe a lot more million SHARES not dollars. shares. And even those when he exercising he's buying shares technically from the company it ALL counts as profit on taxes and ITS NOT LONG TERM CAP GAINS ELIGIBLE. So over the last year plus this year he's essentially getting shares but the literal dollar value of those shares to the government counts as pure profit. So his total income which he's getting taxed at 40% of is in the BILLIONS yes billions. Because that's a lot to handle people that work for them actually automatically schedule sells of shares to cover the taxes so that there's no issue it's not even like him saying sell today and they do this.... TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INSIDER SELLING TO THE SEC. That's why it's automatically happening so no one can ever claim he's timing it. 

So listen cause here's where it gets important. The exercising of the shares counts as almost pure profits but remember he's receiving SHARES not dollars he doesn't actually get billions of dollars. So has to then sell SOME of the shares so he can pays taxes on that. Then when he sells the shares to pay the taxes for exercising he actually owes even more money if they went up from when he exercised. So everytime he's selling low its actually good for him because it's less ADDITIONAL PROFIT that he would owe taxes on.

 If he wasn't selling its because he thought it would go down even further and then he would actually owe less taxes overall. So if he thought it was going to tank he'd wait and actually get a nice fat discount on his taxes. 

I know this seems really crazy but I promise that's how it works you can look it up in detail but yeah shocking that mainstream media and redditors/youtubers who barely do research and have no real understanding of how these billion dollar compensations work would get it wrong. Unbelievable I know. If he had actually sold the massive overall percentage of his shares that some people claim he did the company would be at like $3-6 dollars not low 20s.

What is Blue Apron?


Blue Apron (NYSE: APRN) was the forgotten step child, bad luck Brian, IPO of summer 2017 that priced below range and had the misfortune of debuting after Amazon bought Whole Foods. Since it‚Äôs debut, the stock has suffered dropping from nearly $150 per share (adjusted for a 2019 reverse-split necessitated to stay listed) to as low as approximately $2.00!


Why the Drop?


Management. Fucking. Sucked. The prior executive team essentially handed Chad Hello Fresh the keys to the kingdom, when they made the fatal error of betting that the ‚Äúhigh affinity core users‚Äù would be enough to sustain the business. For this reason, they cut marketing to nearly nothing and attempted to realize operating leverage by shrinking the customer base only to its most prolific buyers.

This was stupid. HelloFresh did the opposite, essentially giving away meals, and they used it to stockpile market share. Put a chart up of HelloFresh customers against Blue Apron. You‚Äôll see the two lines converge and a clear indication that HelloFresh stole most of their business. HelloFresh was one of the best trades of the past 5 years. Look at the chart, look at the sales, and look at the margins. They have managed to achieve operating leverage by employing affordable pricing and emphasizing retention.


Blue Apron Might Go Under....


Today the company is in a dire place. Languishing away in Micro Cap hell at an $80M market cap, no one on Wall Street wants to cover these guys. Only their bankers, CG and MS, write them research and neither are overly optimistic. They‚Äôre in a shit spot with a credit line that mandates they keep $15M cash at all times, and they keep their customer base above 300K (thus far, they‚Äôve struggled). They‚Äôre sitting on $29M and burn enough cash per Q that they might go below that $15M level (wouldn‚Äôt be a first). All signs are negative...


But I Think They Might Win


Blue Apron is under new management. Linda Kozlowski, is the former COO of ETSY and an ex-strategist at Alibaba. She believes HelloFresh did things right and she wants to right the ship. Her ballsy-ass plan is to ride the line on cash and go all in on customer growth. She realizes those customers are worth a lot more than income on the P&L, and that she needs to make the pot as big as she can. Thus far, it‚Äôs worked. Customers are up over 20% in the past two periods and retention rates are rising. We are seeing signs of operating leverage, and it opens a big possibility.


My Prediction

Management is buying shares. They know the company is not healthy. The only logic is that they have a plan that‚Äôs working. You can‚Äôt sell a dying business with a shrinking share, but you can certainly sell a growing community, that could be an accretive asset to a better capitalized entity. I think Linda is going either get the business in a position where it can refinance for better terms, or where it can be sold to create shareholder value via a strategic alternative.

If that happen, given this is priced for bankruptcy and ignored by the Street, the returns could easily reach the triple digits. I‚Äôm long and I plan to add on additional weakness.

Disclosure- I‚Äôm buying a stock that might go under. This is not advice! I‚Äôm stupid.",nmoit0,Blue Apron: Hero or Zero

Everyone is talking about how the squeeze didn't even happen and the shorts didn't cover yet. What I don't understand is why wouldn't that be possible? If short interest is 17%, so let's round up to about 100M shares. Today the volume traded was 700M shares. Couldn't 100M of those 700M have been the shorts covering? And if they didn't cover, today alone 700M shares were traded, why would 100M shares bought by shorts cause a squeeze if today 700M were traded?

I have been having this question for awhile, since I noticed the same with GME. In the days preceding January 28th (when GME reached its peak), the combined volume was several times the amount of float. How come the squeeze happened and why did it happen? If the volume was so high, couldn't the shorts have covered in the days preceding that?

I hope this makes sense and I really hope someone will be kind enough to explain a fellow retard who only knows about crayons what this all means.

Everything looked to have gone off successfully. We are now waiting on the data and craft to be analysed and inspected. This will take a few weeks according to Michael Colglazier.
That being said he had already outlined the test schedule in the earnings zoom call.

1st test flight - may 
2nd crewed flight - June 
3rd flight with R Branson on board late June/July 

4th flight this will be taking the Italian airforce on a training mission (600k a seat) late July


On the run in to the first test flight some possible maintenance issues appeared with the carrier plane White knight 2‚Ä¶. 
This indeed could have gone either way , after 2 weeks inspections it was decided that WK2 did not need to delay testing no maintenance was needed at this point. Scheduled Maintenance will commence in the fall after all tests have been completed.

The plan includes creating an online ticketing platform by Great British Railways which might have a huge blow on Trainline revenue. However, this platform does not yet exist and will probably take a couple of years to develop. Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed.

In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales.  Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%.

I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time  for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

5088,,2021-05-28 10:41:01,t3_nmuzzi,,wallstreetbets,"Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent of Modernas if not more. Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects) 

Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

Imagine if the spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize one piece to understand the whole picture it and helps modify your DNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates it can still recognize the virus. In contrast to using one portion of the picture as it mutates it's easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine, that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. Not only that but they have had the least amount of side effects of any covid vaccine deeming it the safest covid vaccine.... 

And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein (whole picture) and the safety profile. Also worth a mention is that you could store it in a regular refrigerator, and let it sit out in room temperature while you're vaccinating people instead of a special ultra low temp freeze needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers, this is a majority of the world. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines so other protein competitors will be far behind and they will have an a moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing they teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine. They will be combining flu and covid vaccine by 2025 for possibly double the price of current covid vaccine.

 They are pretty much de-risked at this point. Yes you could buy other  biotechs that can go up 20x but are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up) that has all successful trials done so far, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment to where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place there are no more glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""

They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. Yesterday at market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. 
 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

Future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract in there ( in the link below in another message). It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 

As far as my position I own some $200 July calls along with about 933 shares. I'm all in baby.  Been in since $4.06, I panicked and sold once during February a couple months during the mini bear market we had and got back in a bit too early so got a wash sale üôà but I'm diamond hands all the way to $800 from here.  LFG I expect to turn that into a cool million in a year's time via shares and options based on the DD provided. Just know this isn't all completely my DD some of this is taken from my good friends at the community Nvax community on Stocktwits. They're one of the most hardcore groups that provides excellent DD and are always willing to help each other a hand if anyone's got questions highly recommend to check it out. So my point is this is information collected over the months that is a group consensus on nvax future price. (Check out next link below this paragraph, it has My positions and an amazing DD chart converting contracts to future price and comparing with competitors. My screen name on stovktwits  is the same on there Johnnyknowsbest. Been on there and here since i started with nvax.

Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. This is huge as the combo is going to differentiate them especially since both flu and covid vaccines are first in class.

1) We look to the PTON CFO's statement found in the latest earnings call transcript, for guidance:
""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior.""
2) Being that we do not have access to a 10-K filing for Q4 fiscal '19, we will access other filings that do in fact reference numbers from fiscal '19...
A) 10-K filing dated 9/11/2020
B) 10-Q filing dated 5/6/2020
3) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $223.3M under Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19)
But, that is TOTAL Revenue; we need to find out what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike sales...
4) To calculate what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike Sales, we can use numbers from neighboring Q3 (i.e. Three Months Ended March 31, 2019)...
A) On page 6 of the 10-Q, you will find Revenue of ""Connected Fitness Products"" (aka Bike Sales) to be $261.6M
B) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $316.7M
C) % of Bike Sales per TOTAL Revenue: $261.6M / $316.7M * 100 = 82.6% {""Connected Fitness Products"" Revenue (aka Bike Sales)}
5) Apply 82.6% to the TOTAL Revenue $223.3M for Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19): $223.3M x 0.826 = $184.45M {Bike Sales for Q4 of fiscal '19}
6) Per the CFO, ""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior."":

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote... By mid-July, we‚Äôll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase precious metals  especially silver amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative 

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

Gold rose over 60% in the 1930s as the prices of stocks and real estate crashed. You could buy an entire block with a one ounce gold coin. Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms.

I must address Cramer's statement because he is obviously trying to add fuel to the short-selling fire: When he says ""we're not going natural gas"" he is clearly making a vague and general statement meant to be interpreted in the worst possible way: ""no one is going to buy or use natural gas."" By now, I hope everyone that is interested in this stock understands that CLNE offers an alternative transportation fuel, thus, the investments made by BP and Chevron, and not revolutionary technology like some EV's (but this is mostly hype meant to catapult EVs to the front. What most people do not realize is that driverless technology and such can be placed in Petro vehicles too). Also, unfortunately, the company has done a terrible marketting job. That's why powerful analysts can get away with making vague and unsupported statements. The fact that Cramer explained the stock's decrease over the last month as being due to widespread dissaproval is misleading, at best. Many people do not yet know about the cleanliness and therapeutic effects RNG has on the climate. We must get the word out and pressure CLNE corporate to begin marketting campaigns to get the word out. I think it's about time.",nn0whs,Cramer on CLNE

The News...

If you haven't read yet it looks like Federal Cannabis legalization my be around the corner. [Here](https://www.mpp.org/policy/federal/the-more-act/) is the House Bill. Supporters seem on board and like the reforms they have done to the bill including rescheduling cannabis. [Last time](https://mjbizdaily.com/key-us-house-lawmaker-reintroduces-federal-marijuana-legalization-bill/) the bill was introduced it cleared the House.   


Personally I think this gets a lot of support especially from a fiscal point of view. With stimulus stalling and a giant debate going on about how to pay for the stimulus I think cannabis offers the easiest way to collect federal revenue. A simple review of the bill and the fiscal benefits to the Fed's can be read [here](https://www.justtherealnews.com/congress/nadler-blumenauer-lee-jackson-lee-jeffries-velazquez-reintroduce-comprehensive-marijuana-reform-legislation/). The bill states a 5% fed tax. Money coming for uncle Sam, right when questions about paying for stimulus.... Personally I think it adds up, but that's for you to decide. 

Okay so that's the hype...

Let's talk about the tickers listed ($SNDL and $TLRY). 

$SNDL

I'll start with the cheaper YOLO, $SNDL. $SNDL short interest isn't high, but the company did issue convertible notes a while back around .7c if my memory is correct. I'm not saying they won't do it again, but they should be in a good place fiscally for now. Float is high with about 1.6B shares out there. However today's volume at the time of writing is over 415M. That's not bad given such a high float. It's about 200% more than the average volume. 

The options chain on $SNDL has me giddy. With over 200,000 options currently in the money on todays move above $1 there is some high potential here for some interesting action. The put to call ratio is just obnoxiously low at .08 it's screaming upwards betting. If we hold above $1 the potential squeeze up could be amazing.   


It's also broken up on the trend lines and out of the downward channel it was in. The regression channel from the peak squeeze back in Feb just broke out today according to my crayons I have laying around. 

$TLRY

$TLRY was the squeeze of a lifetime if you remember it back in 19'. The ticker was just a money printer with it's low float and stupid hype. Then they proceeded to do, like they all do, and issue debt. Shares tumbled since then falling from $120 --> $5. Ouch bag holders.   


Like all the cannabis stocks the Feb bump pushed $TLRY to above $60 in an amazing move. $TLRY has a lower short interest than $SNDL, but it also has a much lower float at about 300M. Compared to $SNDL the volume here isn't as good, but still remains decently above the avg volume around 36M as of right now. 

If we peep the options chain we also see a crazy low P/C ratio around .11. But we don't have the Open Interest in the chain like $SNDL does unless you roll out to Jun 18. Then we finally get some decent OI.   


Personally I am going with $SNDL. The option's chain looks better, the stock is cheaper, and the short interest is a little better. My advice would be to roll out till at least the Jun 11th $1 strike to not get eaten alive by Theta and IV crush. But WSB does what WSB wants and that's why I love you all.   
Do not go above the $2 strikes IMO. You will get crushed by theta unless we get an insane move, which could happen but I don't see the risk / reward there.",nn326f,MORE ACT / CANNABIS / $SNDL & $TLRY Potential

>A corner in the silver market has been tried before - and let's be clear, that is what is being attempted now.  In 1980, a rule change by the government destroyed the corner.  #silverthursday.

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday

>Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers‚Äô attempt to corner the market on the metal.

-
>Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926‚Äì2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers‚Äô Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.

-
>By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged‚ÄîMarch 27‚Äîsilver fell to $10.80, the metal‚Äôs biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, ‚ÄúA billion dollars isn‚Äôt what it used to be,‚Äù the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.

-
>To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978‚Äì91) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities.",nn36fw,There is no silver short squeeze happening.

* Henrik Fisker is a God among men in the automotive industry - trust him to do right
* Geeta Gupta-Fisker is a solid Chief Financial Officer with experience in investment banking - she will ensure the shares are valued right
* Henrik has learned from all the mistakes he made with his previous attempt to create Fisker Automotive, and will certainly do everything in his power to avoid that mess again. He has designed systems into the intricacies of the company to avoid failure - meaning Fisker Inc is guaranteed to succeed
* Henrik Fisker on shorting $FSR - ‚ÄúYou will quickly understand that you stand to lose a lot of money if you show it against Fisker‚Äù
* Production of Fisker Ocean expected to start in November 2022
* 250,000+ units a year expected by 2025
* Partnerships with Foxconn and Magna Steyr, both giants in their respective industries, among others
* Large Fleet market in Europe gaining momentum, and 700+ Fisker reservations in this market alone
* 16,000+ reservations already. More than Tesla had 18 months pre-production
* Revenue streams include leasing automotives, servicing, selling emissions credits, selling insurance (like selling the pickaxe to miners, and selling the diamonds to the mine owners too, absolutely genius - Fisker are insuring cars which they own, because the customer is only leasing it)
* High short interest (20%+), high analyst price targets compared to current share price (100%+) and low valuation compared to peers ($3bn market cap currently)
* Designing the first ever all-electric popemobile - Massive, soon to be historic, event!
* I give $FSR (currently $13 a share) a price target of $100 by end of year 2022, if not sooner
* Price Targets: $35 by end of year - Previous ATH. $50 start of next year - European and Chinese debut of prototypes. $100 end of 2022 - start of production (SOP). $150+ 2023
* 2025 Price Targets, calculated using projected data: Bear case - $97 a share, Bull case - $519 a share
* Downside in the short term is capped by the large amount of cash on hand - one third of market cap is cash. Long term, is capped by risk factors, which are almost eligible and affect every automotive startup anyway.

In 1989, Fisker began working at BMW Technik, the company's advanced design studio in Munich. His first project there was the E1 electric concept car. -  Henrik Fisker has been working on Electric cars since 1989, years before most people even knew about them.

From 1992 to 1997, he refined the Z07 concept car, which would become the BMW Z8 roadster, produced from 1999 to 2003.In 2016, at a press conference celebrating BMW's 100th anniversary, BMW CEO Harald Krueger named the Z8 as one of his three favorite BMW models in the history of the company.

In 2007, Tesla Motors hired Henrik Fisker to perform initial design work on the Tesla Model S electric sedan, which was introduced in 2012.

Fisker stated in 2018 that, with the growth of car-sharing, ride-hailing, and autonomous shuttles, he believes within 10 years private cars will be used for less than half of what they are currently used for.

## Fisker Automotive

In 2008, Fisker Automotive raised over $90 million from investors including venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. In September 2009, Fisker Automotive was awarded a $528 million loan guarantee by the United States Department of Energy (DOE). The automaker was one of four recipients of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, to encourage the domestic manufacture of electric cars. The funds were to be used to develop the Karma, as well as an affordable family-size plug-in hybrid car. The loan facility was frozen at $192 million in February 2012, after the DOE claimed that Fisker missed its milestones

In December 2011, just as the Fisker Karma was launched, its battery supplier, A123 Systems, recalled all batteries, followed by a second recall in 2012. A123 filed for bankruptcy in October 2012, leaving Fisker Automotive without a battery supplier. After selling approximately 2,000 units, production of the Fisker Karma was suspended in November 2012, in the absence of its battery supplier.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/59vfj5wa8w171.png?width=511&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1c03d1e1254fea00c195776122de2b26099dd35

Henrik Fisker resigned as chairman from Fisker Automotive in March 2013, because of disagreements with management about business strategy. Later that year, the company declared voluntary bankruptcy.Fisker raised and spent more than a billion dollars over its lifetime.The heart of Fisker‚Äôs business model was in that early deal with Quantum. The idea was to design a gorgeous car, and have suppliers like Quantum provide the technology because off-the-shelf parts from suppliers would help keep costs down.

But there were problems with this strategy: Sometimes, those parts had to be custom-made to fit the design vision, which resulted in higher prices for Fisker. Other times, parts were delivered late or, worse, faulty, but Fisker was locked in to those supplier relationships. Sources close to Fisker have also said that many of the parts were owned by the suppliers themselves, so Fisker didn‚Äôt own a lot of the internal technology.

The broker that raised funds for Fisker automotive, by selling their private shares, was Advanced Equities.It wasn‚Äôt until December 2011 and into 2012 that the more dubious efforts of Advanced Equities became clearer to Fisker‚Äôs hundreds of investors. The last few hundred million dollars of Advanced Equities‚Äô fund raising for Fisker, starting with the D-1 round, was what brokers call ‚Äúpay to play.‚Äù As Fisker was running into technical, delivery and political problems, its valuation was quickly declining. But the company still needed more money, so the brokers went back to its current investors and said: Unless you give this more, your current shares will be diluted and your preferred stock will be converted to common stock.

It was essentially a gun to their heads. This is why investor Wray sued Fisker in February 2012, alleging he was on the receiving end of this tactic. In his lawsuit, he says Advanced Equities sent him a letter dated Jan. 18, 2012, stating that he needed to decide if he wanted to invest in Fisker‚Äôs next round, and pay around $84,000 by Jan. 27, 2012 ‚Äî a little over a week from receiving the letter. He also says that Advanced Equities assured him that he would have anti-dilution protection. According to the audio clip from Advanced Equities‚Äô internal sales call in early 2010, Advanced Equity leaders say that the Fisker deal will ‚Äúsuffer no dilution,‚Äù and was ‚Äúa dream scenario.‚Äù

That dream would soon end. In September 2012 after Fisker closed on $1.2 billion in funding, the bulk of it organized by Advanced Equities, the SEC charged the broker with misleading investors when it raised money for another company back in 2009 and 2010 (Bloom Energy). Advanced settled, agreeing to pay $1 million, and its co-founders were personally fined. Two months later Advanced Equities closed up shop.

Later, A123 Systems itself went bankrupt, causing more problems for Fisker. Fisker claimed that A123 Systems owed it $140 million, but a bankruptcy settlement reduced that to a paltry $15 million.

Then there was the just plain terrible luck for the ironically named Karma: Super Storm Sandy wiped out 338 of its Karmas in storage in New Jersey. The cars first drowned, and then caught on fire ‚Äî salt water damage caused a short circuit that was spread to other cars by high winds, Fisker said at the time.

With all of this happening in public ‚Äî and in a presidential election year ‚Äî Fisker‚Äôs struggles became highly politicized. The company was mentioned numerous times in presidential debates and speeches leading up to the election. Republican nominee Romney called Fisker and other DOE-supported companies losers.

The company didn‚Äôt seem to invest substantially in technology innovation or tech IP, and seemed to spend a disproportionate amount on suppliers. For example, numerous sources have said that the company paid upfront for 15,000 of some of the parts for its planned 15,000 Karmas. It ended up only selling around 2,000 of the cars. It has also been said that Fisker paid some funds upfront to have BMW make engines for the 100,000 Nina cars it hoped to produce ‚Äî in the end, Fisker didn‚Äôt deliver a single Nina.

Costs to build each Karma also creeped up because the company missed its volume targets, and because engineering had to change designs around supplier constraints. The company ended up adding $20,000 to its initial sale price.

Expensive hires may also have sucked away chunks of Fisker‚Äôs funding: Sources say that Fisker filled the upper levels of the company with seasoned auto executives from Detroit. At the high point of Fisker, the company had around 300 employees, plus dozens of contract staff. Bringing in a certain amount of the old guard could help a car startup ramp up quickly, and also impress potential investors with ‚Äúindustry names.‚Äù But those people are also used to big auto-industry budgets that included extensive travel and salaries ‚Äî that‚Äôs the opposite life of a tech startup.

## Fisker Inc.

In July 2016, Henrik Fisker expressed interest in designing a fully connected electric car with autonomous driving features and an aesthetically pleasing look. He has pursued battery technology, and hinted at potentially reviving the Fisker name with a pure-electric vehicle using technology that nobody else has. Since then Fisker has talked about delays to the promised solid state battery technology, which he does not expect to be able to be produced in volume until at least 2025. Posing risk for competition from more scientifically experienced future solid state battery producers such as Quantumscape.

***Forbes:*** ‚ÄúNow he‚Äôs back‚Äìand three things are different. First and foremost, he has a vital new partner: his wife, cofounder and Fisker Inc. CFO Geeta Gupta-Fisker. Second, his Los Angeles-based company is public this time around, raising more than $1 billion in an October 2020 IPO. And finally, Fisker‚Äôs stock price, up 56% since its debut, has made both Henrik and Geeta billionaires, each worth about $1.1 billion as of Friday‚Äôs market close. The auto industry has seen father-son and sibling leadership teams, but Fisker Inc.‚Äôs CEO-CFO combo is the fast-changing sector‚Äôs first husband and wife power couple.‚Äù

Wealth isn‚Äôt the purpose of the new company, Henrik says. ‚ÄúI never got into cars because of money. (This shows he is willing to do what is in the best interest of the company because he is not motivated by money, unlike 99% of other CEO‚Äôs)

The couple sought a big stake in the new venture to ensure they can control its fate in a way Fisker couldn‚Äôt with his earlier company.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yzhded6pfw171.png?width=408&format=png&auto=webp&s=54b30259720cf853a8efeacf058f2f74315260b9

Henrik is an auto industry celebrity, but Geeta‚Äôs background is equally impressive. A native of India, she holds multiple degrees in science, including a Ph.D. in biotechnology from Cambridge University where she was also a Research Newton Fellow. From there, she started a career in international investment for Lloyds Banking Group, and then managed investments for a high-net-worth client for several years. (In particular, this is insanely important - Geeta **KNOWS MONEY**! She knows how best to keep a company afloat, organize its share structure, provide value to shareholders, etc. because she has worked in the industry before. She may just be the most important element of Fisker Inc., due to the financial experience she has. At every step of the way, she is likely to make decisions with one sole focus - increasing share price and value).

She met her future husband in 2011 when he was visiting London, just before things started going very wrong at Fisker Automotive. They married in 2012.

‚ÄúWhen I left Fisker Automotive, all I had was my car,‚Äù Henrik remembers. ‚ÄúI'm in a different position, mainly because of Geeta. Because she cuts the deals.‚Äù

To get the new venture off the ground, the Fiskers invested the majority of their life savings‚Äìan enormous financial risk given the fate of Henrik‚Äôs prior company. Then, just as they were locking in plans for the IPO back in July, they were hit by a highly unwelcome complication: Geeta learned she had early-stage breast cancer.

‚ÄúShe got the call (from her doctor) during a call with investors,‚Äù Henrik says. Despite that bombshell, she continued working with banks and investors in the weeks that followed, even as she underwent two surgical procedures and radiation therapy. Her medical therapy concluded in November.

Henrik, who marvels at her fortitude throughout the health crisis says, ‚Äúshe only missed something like one day of work...That's just how she is. She works tirelessly.‚Äù

## Fisker Ocean

The Fisker Ocean will have a nearly 300-mile range with an 80 kWh battery and a solar panel roof as a range extender, adding approximately 1,000 free miles of range per year. Advanced electronics will be housed under the hood, and the vehicle will incorporate recycled and sustainable materials throughout. Deliveries of the Ocean are scheduled to begin in 2022.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s87j6bdsfw171.png?width=438&format=png&auto=webp&s=e40add9ce53319d31db242cce73a303afb03cbab

Fisker has also announced a partnership with Electrify America to ensure Fisker Ocean vehicles will integrate seamlessly with Electrify America charging stations when the e-SUV hits the market. With features such as a solar roof and recycled inner materials, it will be, according to Fisker Inc., the ""world's most sustainable vehicle.""

In 2017, Fisker Inc. announced that it had filed patents on flexible solid-state battery designs. Fisker expected the batteries to be produced on a mass scale around 2020. A prototype of the battery debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018. In October 2018, Fisker announced new funding for battery development through Caterpillar Venture Capital. The solid-state batteries are intended to deliver longer vehicle range and faster charging times.

In 2018, Fisker was named to the board of directors of First Cobalt, a North American cobalt refinery that produces battery materials.

In September 2019, it was announced that Fisker Inc. was partnering with Game of Thrones actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who will serve as a partner and sustainability adviser to Fisker, to work on advanced, affordable, electric mobility models.

&#x200B;

[In addition to being a well-known actor, Coster-Waldau is also the United Nations Development Program Goodwill Ambassador for climate change and other social issues.](https://preview.redd.it/3hssff5vfw171.png?width=451&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebe55e2468c5b63d1bc0ac3c71547219dff5afaa)

Nikolaj wrote this piece about Fisker:

To quote a friend of mine who is a lot smarter than me, architect Bjarke Ingels: ‚ÄúThe idea that sustainability needs to sacrifice quality of life is a flawed one. It‚Äôs a design challenge, a challenge to build something that transforms the idea of sustainability into something that will increase the quality of life for all those around it.‚Äù

One person meeting that challenge is Henrik Fisker, who has designed some of the most iconic cars over the past decades for BMW and others, like the BMW Z8, Aston Martin DB9 and Aston Martin V8 Vantage. He‚Äôs a hero for gas-guzzling supercars. He is a fellow Dane, I am a fan, and we met, of all places, on Twitter.

When we met in person, he described his new project ‚Äî an all-electric luxury SUV ‚Äî and asked me if I would help spread the word on his car. The problem as I see it with most electric cars is that they only accomplish the basics. They get you from point A to B. They run electric so you don‚Äôt pollute while driving, but that‚Äôs it. They are basically unattractive combustion engine cars that have a battery thrown into them ‚Äî and for most of them, a battery with a limited range. What Fisker does is to try to make every part of the car in a sustainable and attractive way, like a full-length solar roof, recycled floor mats and vegan leather seats. It looks incredibly cool and inviting, with a great 250- to 300-mile range, and at a cost of just under $40,000, it‚Äôs a luxury car affordable to a mass market.

I said yes and even became an investor, not only because it‚Äôs a great car but more importantly, I hope and believe it can inspire other companies to actively incorporate sustainability goals into all aspects of their business. Fisker then had the idea of calling me ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù adviser. Which I am not. Just to be clear. Thanks Henrik, sounds cool, but I am an actor and a citizen, and that‚Äôs really it.

And what about Hollywood? Is our industry changing, are we at the forefront? Looking at social media, you would think so. And things are happening, but usually only when a camera is pointed at people. Remember a few years back when all awards shows only used EVs for the red carpet? We made a difference. We mattered. We showed the way. So cool. So green, so ‚Ä¶ brief. Now it‚Äôs back to the Escalade. But hey, we are not using plastic straws anymore!

To believe that change will come from Hollywood is not really based in reality (when did that stop us?), but we are great at reacting ‚Äî and things around us are changing, and changing us. I have a good friend who loves his SUV. It‚Äôs not electric. But he cannot give up his car. He is a good guy, he‚Äôs works for the U.N., so if he has a problem going electric, we all do. But if he is presented with an alternative that doesn‚Äôt mean a reduction in his quality of life, something like the Fisker SUV, I think he‚Äôd transition to electric in a heartbeat.

The IPO deal values Fisker Inc at US$2.9 billion, with an IPO share price of $10.

On July 30, 2020, Fisker announced plans for a four-vehicle portfolio by 2025. The Fisker Ocean SUV will be joined by a sports sedan based on their previously announced Fisker Emotion concept, a coupe-like SUV, and a lifestyle pickup truck. All will be electric vehicles.

On October 15, 2020, Fisker Inc announced it would be outsourcing vehicle production of its Fisker Ocean electric SUV to Magna Steyr, to reduce the complexities and costs related to the building and operating its own factory. Magna will start building the Fisker Ocean in Europe in 2022.

## Henrik Fisker Interview quotes:

I have people on Twitter saying, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just make the car next month? You have a prototype.‚Äù Most people don‚Äôt understand that it takes 18 months to do long-lead body tooling for high-volume vehicles. Most people don‚Äôt understand it takes two years to do durability tests and do all the engineering certification and everything else.

And on the business model itself, I believe that there is nobody in the near future or the next couple of years that‚Äôs going to make a million EVs on one model. Today, there‚Äôs nobody doing it. Tesla probably has the highest volume of one single model, a couple hundred thousand. But even the big giant established carmakers are not making, right now, a couple hundred thousand vehicles of one model. So the way you get volume, in my view, is if you partner up with other OEMs and share some of the expensive parts of the platform, which in my view is not anymore something that is unique IP or something that is a unique experience to the customer. An aluminum stamped floor or a steel stamped floor really doesn‚Äôt have any brand value anymore.

And obviously, as we move forward, we always start to do some of the things ourselves. But it was really about de-risking in our first vehicle to market. So we‚Äôre going to do another three vehicles, which we can do because we don‚Äôt have to spend all our money and effort on learning how to manufacture a car, for instance.

So we have programmed a lot. We have hired a head of ESG, environmental and social governance, and he is really spearheading developing specific... we kind of put out some goals that we would like to reach with suppliers, and we at least try to bring them in that direction. They are not reaching those goals right now, but they may reach them later. And then we have goals for ourselves. So for instance, we look at transport. Are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs closer to the plant, or are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs on the other side of the planet that way we have to then transport all that stuff. So those are the types of things that we‚Äôre really thinking about now as we‚Äôre nominating suppliers. And finally, materials as well, looking at sustainable materials. We‚Äôve actually picked up a lot of knowledge on that side as well, where we are adding more sustainable materials to our vehicle. So we are actually looking across everything ‚Äî supply chain, where the suppliers are located, what the suppliers are doing for sustainability, and also then of course in the vehicle itself ‚Äî in terms of the type of materials there.

Simple Conclussion : The Fed can‚Äôt go ‚Äúhawkish‚Äù and raise rates without sending markets ‚Äìand economies‚Äìto their knees; by extension, they now have nothing left to ‚Äúcut‚Äù when the current everything bubble implodes.

And that  is a *real problem*.

 There are only two ways for sovereigns to default: 

Inflation or collapse.    

The latter is not an option. 

 As for a solution, what‚Äôs so tragic is that the only option before the Fed is an even bigger problem‚Äîcurrent and inevitably more inflation. 

 That is, if the Fed wants to keep markets (and their job security) breathing, they no longer have the foregoing template of ‚Äúrate-hike-followed-by-rate-cutting‚Äù at their disposal, which means they now have no choice but to dovishly keep rates near the zero-bound indefinitely.

But the only way to keep rates ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù and nailed to the floor of time is to purchase otherwise unwanted bonds to keep their prices elevated and hence yields and rates repressed.

Such bond ‚Äúaccommodation,‚Äù of course, costs money, and as we already know, the only ‚Äúmoney‚Äù the Fed has to spend is the kind they create out of thin air‚Äì the very kind of money (and policy) which leads to the kind of inflation discussed above‚Äînamely, the brutal kind.

 As for that fake money, the evidence of the Fed‚Äôs desperate (and only) direction is now obvious, as the following M2 money supply makes equally clear.

Fed is so embarrassed by this ‚Äúprinting solution‚Äù that they‚Äôve stopped *weekly* reporting of M2 data, and frankly, since March, have even stopped *monthly* reporting of the same.

That, of course, is both telling as well as disgraceful‚Ä¶ The Fed literally has something to hide, and that never bodes well, does it?

&#x200B;

 The correlation to central bank balance sheet (i.e., money supply) expansion and rising markets is now beyond dispute.

 In short‚Äîdo you see the correlation and pattern? Do you see how the Fed‚Äôs market sausage is made? More importantly, do you now see the Fed‚Äôs self-made conundrum? 

 

Given that the Fed bows to the markets not the people, which choice do you think they‚Äôll make?

In other words, expect more money printing and more yield curve control‚Äîand hence more money creation, more inflation, and by extension more fiat currency debasement.

 More money supply to keep rates monetized simply means more currency debasement and rising inflation.",nn51ou,"""Fed's ""Favorite"" #Inflation Indicator (PCE) Explodes At Fastest Rate Since 1992 As Incomes Crash By Record"""

5127,,2021-05-28 20:45:08,t3_nn76we,,wallstreetbets,"TLDR:

I have leading indicators telling me that there are two concurrent shifts underway when it comes to who is purchasing homes.

\- Massive increase in unmarried people buying houses alone. This used to be somewhat unusual, now it's becoming very common.

\- Massive increase in unmarried men, in particular, buying houses alone. Traditionally, the female-to-male ratio of unmarried homebuyers was about 5 to 1. For the last 3 months, it's been closer to 50/50.

Source is my own closed real estate purchase transactions. Am a mortgage broker (btw this means cash purchases are ""invisible"" to me). It takes 3-6 months for [HMDA data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Mortgage_Disclosure_Act) to become accessible to journalists and academics, and thus ""visible"" to the general public (assuming journalists deem it worthy of commenting on), but I can see the trends live in real time.

How would one go about placing a bet that in about 3 or 6 months, the media, journalists, academics, etc, will pick up on this, publish articles, and potentially cause a lot of people to buy certain stocks. Which stocks would that be? Is there a ""Mancave, Inc"" out there that would potentially get an uptick? Or maybe a company making smart-home stuff that is particularly suited to renting by the room (the single men are not buying 1 bedroom condos, they are buying proper houses with 3 bedrooms, etc)?

EDIT: oh, and to be clear. It's not just an uptick in single men. It's an uptick in women too, but a massive surge from the men. It used to be that for 15 banana sales, 10 are to married couples, 4 to single women, and 1 to a single man. Now for the same 15 banana sales, it's 6 to married couples, 6 to single women, and 3 to single men, something like that.",nn76we,Homebuyer Demographics Shift towards single and male. How to bet?

I have been doing research and talking to as many people I can that have some sort of experience/knowledge when dealing with the stock market. I heard about the potential to get into AMC and make some serious profit. I invested early on when shares were selling for around $8.00. I kept reading we need to hold until June 2nd and reevaluate. That‚Äôs my current plan, but hey I don‚Äôt know much about the game lol.

My current understanding of why there is a squeeze is because of previous events which backed hedge funds into a corner. Basically the hedge funds have had to borrow shares to pay off debt to companies like GME. When borrowing those shares, hedge fund companies left themselves vulnerable because they have no more money to borrow to pay off their debt. So if everyone buys stock in AMC and holds it, then the hedge fund companies are forced to pay out. The more people that buy and hold their shares then the higher the shares are worth and over time it will pay a profit. 

Like I said, I‚Äôm new to the game and this is just my current understanding of how the masses can manipulate the stock market. Please comment and enlighten me on another view point or correct my understanding. Let‚Äôs all get rich and work together with the power of knowledge!

It was on a Thursday night 02/25/2021 when I posted, at the time RKT was around 19-20 range and on the following Monday 03/01/2021 it started rallying, by 03/02 & 03/03 it hit the ATH level 43. You‚Äôre welcome to find my last DD post for verification. And for those of you who made tendies on it congratulations to you all! Spread the good energy!

As I am writing this post Today is 05/28/2021, I‚Äôll try to bring more data and technical analysis on $RKT, as you all saw what happened yesterday 05/27/2021 around lunch time upon sudden move it went from 17.50 area all the way to 19.40. This move doesn‚Äôt seem so random at all, a combination of someone noticed this to be a strategic technical squeeze just testing the water after it being suppressed down for the past 3 months, and you can see how fast the shorts started covering all of a sudden.

Today 05/28/2021, at opening it shot up to $19.20 but the shorts came prepared for $RKT this morning with their analysts and news blasting numerous articles and downgrades from Morgan Stanley, Wedbush & Zacks, ALL AT ONCE. This is certainly no coincidence.

On the technical side, on the daily chart as you can see it has a gap to fill around 22.67 area then it‚Äôll go straight to 28 and has a huge potential to pass beyond that and make it to a new all-time high, there‚Äôs nothing stopping it. On the daily MACD closed red and turned green, RSI is at the same level as last time before it squeezed to ATH $43, Parabolic S.A.R indicator flipped from red on the daily to green for the first time in 3 months. Another important factor is as you look at the volume and candle compared to last time it exploded (both red arrows) same volume, same price action.

Conclusion: the shorts are basically scared sh\*tless right now and they know it, is a tickle to the trigger for it to explode again like last time or even higher. Based on Excess Returns Model the fair value for RKT is $85, so why haven't we seen $100 yet?

5739,,2021-05-28 03:12:37,t3_nmofz4,,wallstreetbets,"This started as a comment reply but I thought maybe people would like reading it. I've been researching Palantir since literally late November 2020 and I have nearly my entire portfolio in LEAPS expiring January 2023. So I have continually done more research on them this is just the basics to clear up confusion and help people who don't understand it because it's hard to hear all the hype and stuff. Also AMC to the moon tomorrow for my FDs I bought!! Don't judge me it's just fun to be in on the action on weeks like this.


So you should think of palantir as basically three companies and they actually are very far from unprofitable. 

They developed the really massive government software (gotham) specifically as a result of an interaction that happened to Peter Thiel while he was at paypal. They were losing millions to foreign scammers at paypal and the solution ended up being a high quality algorithm that flagged the most likely scam transactions and then allowed analysts to efficiently double check and verify the real scam transactions.

 It essentially was using what computers are efficient at (sorting through massive amounts of data) and then combining that with what humans are good at (looking at the more complex nuances that at least at that point computer algorithms were incapable of doing) and augmenting the humans ability to make complex decisions by rapidly sorting through the incoming data and bringing everything good to their attention.

They fixed paypals using this method and literally made the company profitable overnight because of fixing how much they were losing in the scam transactions. The FBI contacted PayPal and Thiel about using that initial software. That was literally his inspiration for what would become Palantir. He goes over it in huge detail in his book zero to one. If you make an audible account you can read it for free and find the chapter I'm talking about.

Then for 15 years they perfected the government software into the absolute nearly monopoly it is now in government intelligence augmentation software. The whole time though they reinvested almost everything for the last 10 years into building the commercial software (Foundry). That side of the business has only been live for a VERY short time and initially they literally didn't spend a single dollar on marketing their first commercial clients sought THEM out because of their insane reputation with the government. Foundry helps with supply chains and all kinds of other important data  insights. But if you want a recent example the NIH and the NHS both used Foundry to figure out how to best distribute the vaccine and vaccine distribution in the US and Britain has far outpaced expectations. You think commercial companies aren't going to be interested in using the software that was literally proven on a level like that?

 They're only just now adding huge amounts of people to their sales teams literally in the last six months which if you read Peter thiels book is insane for the stock because they have this crazy long term plan and he literally talks about how when they get to a certain point and start adding sales as a full sector of the company it means that is the company the company plans to BEGIN scaling. Meaning they're this big and they literally only just started on the scaling part. Which they've also said in tons of interviews if you're a die hard Palantirian like me. 



They actually also have the third side of the  business which is their actual like full AI for weaponization and war and defense for the government. Gotham is like helping analysts and commanders lead and even helping police or agents figure out what's going on. This other software is different. It's called Apollo and its only at the beginning too. It's like pure AI machine learning AI handles everything stuff. Go find a video called pentagon head of NSC briefs public on AI I think it's on the PBS channel on YouTube or some shit. Or you can listen to Joe Biden talk about how we're going to double our percentage of gdp spending on AI. The amount of government money that's going to go into AI as a weapon to compete with China DWARFS peoples expectations of how much large the market for the kind of software palantir makes is. 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201001005334/en/U.S.-Army-Research-Lab-Selects-Palantir-Technologies-Inc.-for-91M-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-Development

This is literally the backbone of everything AI that the government is about to invest in. Sure they're going to experiment with other research but if you do research you'll also find Palantir is the ONLY company that does anything remotely like this software that has anywhere near the kind of clearances like what is required for these contracts. They are currently a clearance level 5 and about to be the highest 6. The closest competitors are almost all a 3 or lower I'm not even sure if there's more than a single 4 and that stuff is crazy hard to get. 

But like again I'm an obsessive. I realize why people get so excited about the commercial side scaling and how it's very possible and can make them huge and it will. But I'm actually pretty sure the reason people like Cathy Wood has such a huge boner for them is that she realizes how MASSIVELY. And I mean MASSIVELY underestimated the amount of government revenue they will get from all this AI investing the United States and NATO are about to do. It's literally the next Manhattan project and they're absolutely going to be one of the biggest players developing it if not the biggest. I think it's funny because most people are pretty disinterested in the government stuff for Palantir but i really think the weaponized AI apollo stuff may be as big as anything could ever be. 




Also people got the insider selling stuff very very wrong. Tom Nash (love him or hate him I don't care) has a few really good recent videos where he explains it in basically full detail what was happening. The selling panicked a lot of retail investors during a time when the buying for growth markets had really slowed because of rate hike due to inflation scares and a ton of retail holders got scared and caused more selling and more people got scared because of that and sold and it really just was mass psychology in effect and a LOT of FUD and confusion. 

Basically a few executives karp in particular got billions of dollars worth of options that vest but literally expire so you have to exercise them which means you buy shares of the company at a strike price. Well because it's the company granting shares the strike price is literally 10 cents or something and these automatically have to vest at quarterly increments. So everytime karp was exercising he's actually buying shares. Like over 150 million in total maybe a lot more million SHARES not dollars. shares. And even those when he exercising he's buying shares technically from the company it ALL counts as profit on taxes and ITS NOT LONG TERM CAP GAINS ELIGIBLE. So over the last year plus this year he's essentially getting shares but the literal dollar value of those shares to the government counts as pure profit. So his total income which he's getting taxed at 40% of is in the BILLIONS yes billions. Because that's a lot to handle people that work for them actually automatically schedule sells of shares to cover the taxes so that there's no issue it's not even like him saying sell today and they do this.... TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INSIDER SELLING TO THE SEC. That's why it's automatically happening so no one can ever claim he's timing it. 

So listen cause here's where it gets important. The exercising of the shares counts as almost pure profits but remember he's receiving SHARES not dollars he doesn't actually get billions of dollars. So has to then sell SOME of the shares so he can pays taxes on that. Then when he sells the shares to pay the taxes for exercising he actually owes even more money if they went up from when he exercised. So everytime he's selling low its actually good for him because it's less ADDITIONAL PROFIT that he would owe taxes on.

 If he wasn't selling its because he thought it would go down even further and then he would actually owe less taxes overall. So if he thought it was going to tank he'd wait and actually get a nice fat discount on his taxes. 

I know this seems really crazy but I promise that's how it works you can look it up in detail but yeah shocking that mainstream media and redditors/youtubers who barely do research and have no real understanding of how these billion dollar compensations work would get it wrong. Unbelievable I know. If he had actually sold the massive overall percentage of his shares that some people claim he did the company would be at like $3-6 dollars not low 20s. Retail got confused because of market pressured due to interest rate fears from inflation and sold low (like retail always does) to institutions.",nmofz4,"Palantir DD if you want to understand company and it's history better (also insider ""selling"" explained in detail)"

What is Blue Apron?


Blue Apron (NYSE: APRN) was the forgotten step child, bad luck Brian, IPO of summer 2017 that priced below range and had the misfortune of debuting after Amazon bought Whole Foods. Since it‚Äôs debut, the stock has suffered dropping from nearly $150 per share (adjusted for a 2019 reverse-split necessitated to stay listed) to as low as approximately $2.00!


Why the Drop?


Management. Fucking. Sucked. The prior executive team essentially handed Chad Hello Fresh the keys to the kingdom, when they made the fatal error of betting that the ‚Äúhigh affinity core users‚Äù would be enough to sustain the business. For this reason, they cut marketing to nearly nothing and attempted to realize operating leverage by shrinking the customer base only to its most prolific buyers.

This was stupid. HelloFresh did the opposite, essentially giving away meals, and they used it to stockpile market share. Put a chart up of HelloFresh customers against Blue Apron. You‚Äôll see the two lines converge and a clear indication that HelloFresh stole most of their business. HelloFresh was one of the best trades of the past 5 years. Look at the chart, look at the sales, and look at the margins. They have managed to achieve operating leverage by employing affordable pricing and emphasizing retention.


Blue Apron Might Go Under....


Today the company is in a dire place. Languishing away in Micro Cap hell at an $80M market cap, no one on Wall Street wants to cover these guys. Only their bankers, CG and MS, write them research and neither are overly optimistic. They‚Äôre in a shit spot with a credit line that mandates they keep $15M cash at all times, and they keep their customer base above 300K (thus far, they‚Äôve struggled). They‚Äôre sitting on $29M and burn enough cash per Q that they might go below that $15M level (wouldn‚Äôt be a first). All signs are negative...


But I Think They Might Win


Blue Apron is under new management. Linda Kozlowski, is the former COO of ETSY and an ex-strategist at Alibaba. She believes HelloFresh did things right and she wants to right the ship. Her ballsy-ass plan is to ride the line on cash and go all in on customer growth. She realizes those customers are worth a lot more than income on the P&L, and that she needs to make the pot as big as she can. Thus far, it‚Äôs worked. Customers are up over 20% in the past two periods and retention rates are rising. We are seeing signs of operating leverage, and it opens a big possibility.


My Prediction

Management is buying shares. They know the company is not healthy. The only logic is that they have a plan that‚Äôs working. You can‚Äôt sell a dying business with a shrinking share, but you can certainly sell a growing community, that could be an accretive asset to a better capitalized entity. I think Linda is going either get the business in a position where it can refinance for better terms, or where it can be sold to create shareholder value via a strategic alternative.

If that happen, given this is priced for bankruptcy and ignored by the Street, the returns could easily reach the triple digits. I‚Äôm long and I plan to add on additional weakness.

Disclosure- I‚Äôm buying a stock that might go under. This is not advice! I‚Äôm stupid.",nmoit0,Blue Apron: Hero or Zero

Everyone is talking about how the squeeze didn't even happen and the shorts didn't cover yet. What I don't understand is why wouldn't that be possible? If short interest is 17%, so let's round up to about 100M shares. Today the volume traded was 700M shares. Couldn't 100M of those 700M have been the shorts covering? And if they didn't cover, today alone 700M shares were traded, why would 100M shares bought by shorts cause a squeeze if today 700M were traded?

I have been having this question for awhile, since I noticed the same with GME. In the days preceding January 28th (when GME reached its peak), the combined volume was several times the amount of float. How come the squeeze happened and why did it happen? If the volume was so high, couldn't the shorts have covered in the days preceding that?

I hope this makes sense and I really hope someone will be kind enough to explain a fellow retard who only knows about crayons what this all means.

Everything looked to have gone off successfully. We are now waiting on the data and craft to be analysed and inspected. This will take a few weeks according to Michael Colglazier.
That being said he had already outlined the test schedule in the earnings zoom call.

1st test flight - may 
2nd crewed flight - June 
3rd flight with R Branson on board late June/July 

4th flight this will be taking the Italian airforce on a training mission (600k a seat) late July


On the run in to the first test flight some possible maintenance issues appeared with the carrier plane White knight 2‚Ä¶. 
This indeed could have gone either way , after 2 weeks inspections it was decided that WK2 did not need to delay testing no maintenance was needed at this point. Scheduled Maintenance will commence in the fall after all tests have been completed.
Upon this news it is my opinion that the testing programme will go ahead as planned.

The market has responded accordingly and the stock is now up from $17-‚Ç¨31

With all these catalysts lined up before the end of the year and commercial operations looming for early 2022 things are looking up for Virgin Galactic.The success of the last test flight the company have now proven tech and concept. 
Also with revenue now coming in Nasa who are conducting micro gravity analysis.
Also international training for military pilots and astronauts.
Commercial flights look imminent.

I had a look at $BB and assume that we finally formed the bottom. In the last few days we saw a sharp rise which might continue in the next weeks. If we can break the 12$ resistance, the next targets would be aroung 25-28$. 

Using Elliot wave theory we are probably at the end of the correction wave 4 and now began with the bullish wave 5.

Price targets:

\#1 12$

\#2 25$

\#3 48$

5762,,2021-05-28 09:17:32,t3_nmtt43,,wallstreetbets,"Trainline has taken a huge dip since the UK government's announcement of the plan to nationalise the railway network. The plan includes creating an online ticketing platform by Great British Railways which might have a huge blow on Trainline revenue. However, this platform does not yet exist and will probably take a couple of years to develop. Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed.

In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales.  Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%.

I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time  for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

This is my first time making a post here, please do give constructive feedback and criticism.

5767,,2021-05-28 10:41:01,t3_nmuzzi,,wallstreetbets,"Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent of Modernas if not more. Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects) 

Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

Imagine if the spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize one piece to understand the whole picture it and helps modify your DNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates it can still recognize the virus. In contrast to using one portion of the picture as it mutates it's easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine, that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. Not only that but they have had the least amount of side effects of any covid vaccine deeming it the safest covid vaccine.... 

And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein (whole picture) and the safety profile. Also worth a mention is that you could store it in a regular refrigerator, and let it sit out in room temperature while you're vaccinating people instead of a special ultra low temp freeze needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers, this is a majority of the world. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines so other protein competitors will be far behind and they will have an a moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing they teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine. They will be combining flu and covid vaccine by 2025 for possibly double the price of current covid vaccine.

 They are pretty much de-risked at this point. Yes you could buy other  biotechs that can go up 20x but are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up) that has all successful trials done so far, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment to where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place there are no more glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""

They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. Yesterday at market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. 
 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

Future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract in there ( in the link below in another message). It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 

As far as my position I own some $200 July calls along with about 933 shares. I'm all in baby.  Been in since $4.06, I panicked and sold once during February a couple months during the mini bear market we had and got back in a bit too early so got a wash sale üôà but I'm diamond hands all the way to $800 from here.  LFG I expect to turn that into a cool million in a year's time via shares and options based on the DD provided. Just know this isn't all completely my DD some of this is taken from my good friends at the community Nvax community on Stocktwits. They're one of the most hardcore groups that provides excellent DD and are always willing to help each other a hand if anyone's got questions highly recommend to check it out. So my point is this is information collected over the months that is a group consensus on nvax future price. (Check out next link below this paragraph, it has My positions and an amazing DD chart converting contracts to future price and comparing with competitors. My screen name on stovktwits  is the same on there Johnnyknowsbest. Been on there and here since i started with nvax.

Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. This is huge as the combo is going to differentiate them especially since both flu and covid vaccines are first in class.

1) We look to the PTON CFO's statement found in the latest earnings call transcript, for guidance:
""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior.""
2) Being that we do not have access to a 10-K filing for Q4 fiscal '19, we will access other filings that do in fact reference numbers from fiscal '19...
A) 10-K filing dated 9/11/2020
B) 10-Q filing dated 5/6/2020
3) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $223.3M under Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19)
But, that is TOTAL Revenue; we need to find out what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike sales...
4) To calculate what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike Sales, we can use numbers from neighboring Q3 (i.e. Three Months Ended March 31, 2019)...
A) On page 6 of the 10-Q, you will find Revenue of ""Connected Fitness Products"" (aka Bike Sales) to be $261.6M
B) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $316.7M
C) % of Bike Sales per TOTAL Revenue: $261.6M / $316.7M * 100 = 82.6% {""Connected Fitness Products"" Revenue (aka Bike Sales)}
5) Apply 82.6% to the TOTAL Revenue $223.3M for Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19): $223.3M x 0.826 = $184.45M {Bike Sales for Q4 of fiscal '19}

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote... By mid-July, we‚Äôll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase precious metals  especially silver amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative 

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

Gold rose over 60% in the 1930s as the prices of stocks and real estate crashed. You could buy an entire block with a one ounce gold coin. Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms.

I must address Cramer's statement because he is obviously trying to add fuel to the short-selling fire: When he says ""we're not going natural gas"" he is clearly making a vague and general statement meant to be interpreted in the worst possible way: ""no one is going to buy or use natural gas."" By now, I hope everyone that is interested in this stock understands that CLNE offers an alternative transportation fuel, thus, the investments made by BP and Chevron, and not revolutionary technology like some EV's (but this is mostly hype meant to catapult EVs to the front. What most people do not realize is that driverless technology and such can be placed in Petro vehicles too). Also, unfortunately, the company has done a terrible marketting job. That's why powerful analysts can get away with making vague and unsupported statements. The fact that Cramer explained the stock's decrease over the last month as being due to widespread dissaproval is misleading, at best. Many people do not yet know about the cleanliness and therapeutic effects RNG has on the climate.

The News...

If you haven't read yet it looks like Federal Cannabis legalization my be around the corner. [Here](https://www.mpp.org/policy/federal/the-more-act/) is the House Bill. Supporters seem on board and like the reforms they have done to the bill including rescheduling cannabis. [Last time](https://mjbizdaily.com/key-us-house-lawmaker-reintroduces-federal-marijuana-legalization-bill/) the bill was introduced it cleared the House.   


Personally I think this gets a lot of support especially from a fiscal point of view. With stimulus stalling and a giant debate going on about how to pay for the stimulus I think cannabis offers the easiest way to collect federal revenue. A simple review of the bill and the fiscal benefits to the Fed's can be read [here](https://www.justtherealnews.com/congress/nadler-blumenauer-lee-jackson-lee-jeffries-velazquez-reintroduce-comprehensive-marijuana-reform-legislation/). The bill states a 5% fed tax. Money coming for uncle Sam, right when questions about paying for stimulus.... Personally I think it adds up, but that's for you to decide. 

Okay so that's the hype...

Let's talk about the tickers listed ($SNDL and $TLRY). 

$SNDL

I'll start with the cheaper YOLO, $SNDL. $SNDL short interest isn't high, but the company did issue convertible notes a while back around .7c if my memory is correct. I'm not saying they won't do it again, but they should be in a good place fiscally for now. Float is high with about 1.6B shares out there. However today's volume at the time of writing is over 415M. That's not bad given such a high float. It's about 200% more than the average volume. 

The options chain on $SNDL has me giddy. With over 200,000 options currently in the money on todays move above $1 there is some high potential here for some interesting action. The put to call ratio is just obnoxiously low at .08 it's screaming upwards betting. If we hold above $1 the potential squeeze up could be amazing.   


It's also broken up on the trend lines and out of the downward channel it was in. The regression channel from the peak squeeze back in Feb just broke out today according to my crayons I have laying around. 

$TLRY

$TLRY was the squeeze of a lifetime if you remember it back in 19'. The ticker was just a money printer with it's low float and stupid hype. Then they proceeded to do, like they all do, and issue debt. Shares tumbled since then falling from $120 --> $5. Ouch bag holders.   


Like all the cannabis stocks the Feb bump pushed $TLRY to above $60 in an amazing move. $TLRY has a lower short interest than $SNDL, but it also has a much lower float at about 300M. Compared to $SNDL the volume here isn't as good, but still remains decently above the avg volume around 36M as of right now. 

If we peep the options chain we also see a crazy low P/C ratio around .11. But we don't have the Open Interest in the chain like $SNDL does unless you roll out to Jun 18. Then we finally get some decent OI.   


Personally I am going with $SNDL. The option's chain looks better, the stock is cheaper, and the short interest is a little better. My advice would be to roll out till at least the Jun 11th $1 strike to not get eaten alive by Theta and IV crush. But WSB does what WSB wants and that's why I love you all.   
Do not go above the $2 strikes IMO. You will get crushed by theta unless we get an insane move, which could happen but I don't see the risk / reward there.",nn326f,MORE ACT / CANNABIS / $SNDL & $TLRY Potential

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday

>Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers‚Äô attempt to corner the market on the metal.

-
>Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926‚Äì2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers‚Äô Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.

-
>By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged‚ÄîMarch 27‚Äîsilver fell to $10.80, the metal‚Äôs biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, ‚ÄúA billion dollars isn‚Äôt what it used to be,‚Äù the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.

-
>To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978‚Äì91) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities.",nn36fw,There is no silver short squeeze happening.

* Henrik has learned from all the mistakes he made with his previous attempt to create Fisker Automotive, and will certainly do everything in his power to avoid that mess again. He has designed systems into the intricacies of the company to avoid failure - meaning Fisker Inc is guaranteed to succeed

* Large Fleet market in Europe gaining momentum, and 700+ Fisker reservations in this market alone
* 16,000+ reservations already. More than Tesla had 18 months pre-production
* Revenue streams include leasing automotives, servicing, selling emissions credits, selling insurance (like selling the pickaxe to miners, and selling the diamonds to the mine owners too, absolutely genius - Fisker are insuring cars which they own, because the customer is only leasing it)
* High short interest (20%+), high analyst price targets compared to current share price (100%+) and low valuation compared to peers ($3bn market cap currently)
* Designing the first ever all-electric popemobile - Massive, soon to be historic, event!
* I give $FSR (currently $13 a share) a price target of $100 by end of year 2022, if not sooner
* Price Targets: $35 by end of year - Previous ATH. $50 start of next year - European and Chinese debut of prototypes. $100 end of 2022 - start of production (SOP). $150+ 2023
* 2025 Price Targets, calculated using projected data: Bear case - $97 a share, Bull case - $519 a share
* Downside in the short term is capped by the large amount of cash on hand - one third of market cap is cash. Long term, is capped by risk factors, which are almost eligible and affect every automotive startup anyway.

## Fisker Automotive

In 2008, Fisker Automotive raised over $90 million from investors including venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. In September 2009, Fisker Automotive was awarded a $528 million loan guarantee by the United States Department of Energy (DOE). The automaker was one of four recipients of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, to encourage the domestic manufacture of electric cars. The funds were to be used to develop the Karma, as well as an affordable family-size plug-in hybrid car. The loan facility was frozen at $192 million in February 2012, after the DOE claimed that Fisker missed its milestones

In December 2011, just as the Fisker Karma was launched, its battery supplier, A123 Systems, recalled all batteries, followed by a second recall in 2012. A123 filed for bankruptcy in October 2012, leaving Fisker Automotive without a battery supplier. After selling approximately 2,000 units, production of the Fisker Karma was suspended in November 2012, in the absence of its battery supplier.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/59vfj5wa8w171.png?width=511&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1c03d1e1254fea00c195776122de2b26099dd35

Henrik Fisker resigned as chairman from Fisker Automotive in March 2013, because of disagreements with management about business strategy. Later that year, the company declared voluntary bankruptcy.Fisker raised and spent more than a billion dollars over its lifetime.The heart of Fisker‚Äôs business model was in that early deal with Quantum. The idea was to design a gorgeous car, and have suppliers like Quantum provide the technology because off-the-shelf parts from suppliers would help keep costs down.

But there were problems with this strategy: Sometimes, those parts had to be custom-made to fit the design vision, which resulted in higher prices for Fisker. Other times, parts were delivered late or, worse, faulty, but Fisker was locked in to those supplier relationships. Sources close to Fisker have also said that many of the parts were owned by the suppliers themselves, so Fisker didn‚Äôt own a lot of the internal technology.

The broker that raised funds for Fisker automotive, by selling their private shares, was Advanced Equities.It wasn‚Äôt until December 2011 and into 2012 that the more dubious efforts of Advanced Equities became clearer to Fisker‚Äôs hundreds of investors. The last few hundred million dollars of Advanced Equities‚Äô fund raising for Fisker, starting with the D-1 round, was what brokers call ‚Äúpay to play.‚Äù As Fisker was running into technical, delivery and political problems, its valuation was quickly declining. But the company still needed more money, so the brokers went back to its current investors and said: Unless you give this more, your current shares will be diluted and your preferred stock will be converted to common stock.

It was essentially a gun to their heads. This is why investor Wray sued Fisker in February 2012, alleging he was on the receiving end of this tactic. In his lawsuit, he says Advanced Equities sent him a letter dated Jan. 18, 2012, stating that he needed to decide if he wanted to invest in Fisker‚Äôs next round, and pay around $84,000 by Jan. 27, 2012 ‚Äî a little over a week from receiving the letter. He also says that Advanced Equities assured him that he would have anti-dilution protection. According to the audio clip from Advanced Equities‚Äô internal sales call in early 2010, Advanced Equity leaders say that the Fisker deal will ‚Äúsuffer no dilution,‚Äù and was ‚Äúa dream scenario.‚Äù

That dream would soon end. In September 2012 after Fisker closed on $1.2 billion in funding, the bulk of it organized by Advanced Equities, the SEC charged the broker with misleading investors when it raised money for another company back in 2009 and 2010 (Bloom Energy). Advanced settled, agreeing to pay $1 million, and its co-founders were personally fined. Two months later Advanced Equities closed up shop.

Later, A123 Systems itself went bankrupt, causing more problems for Fisker. Fisker claimed that A123 Systems owed it $140 million, but a bankruptcy settlement reduced that to a paltry $15 million.

Then there was the just plain terrible luck for the ironically named Karma: Super Storm Sandy wiped out 338 of its Karmas in storage in New Jersey. The cars first drowned, and then caught on fire ‚Äî salt water damage caused a short circuit that was spread to other cars by high winds, Fisker said at the time.

With all of this happening in public ‚Äî and in a presidential election year ‚Äî Fisker‚Äôs struggles became highly politicized. The company was mentioned numerous times in presidential debates and speeches leading up to the election. Republican nominee Romney called Fisker and other DOE-supported companies losers.

The company didn‚Äôt seem to invest substantially in technology innovation or tech IP, and seemed to spend a disproportionate amount on suppliers. For example, numerous sources have said that the company paid upfront for 15,000 of some of the parts for its planned 15,000 Karmas. It ended up only selling around 2,000 of the cars. It has also been said that Fisker paid some funds upfront to have BMW make engines for the 100,000 Nina cars it hoped to produce ‚Äî in the end, Fisker didn‚Äôt deliver a single Nina.

Costs to build each Karma also creeped up because the company missed its volume targets, and because engineering had to change designs around supplier constraints. The company ended up adding $20,000 to its initial sale price.

Expensive hires may also have sucked away chunks of Fisker‚Äôs funding: Sources say that Fisker filled the upper levels of the company with seasoned auto executives from Detroit. At the high point of Fisker, the company had around 300 employees, plus dozens of contract staff. Bringing in a certain amount of the old guard could help a car startup ramp up quickly, and also impress potential investors with ‚Äúindustry names.‚Äù But those people are also used to big auto-industry budgets that included extensive travel and salaries ‚Äî that‚Äôs the opposite life of a tech startup.

## Fisker Inc.

In July 2016, Henrik Fisker expressed interest in designing a fully connected electric car with autonomous driving features and an aesthetically pleasing look. He has pursued battery technology, and hinted at potentially reviving the Fisker name with a pure-electric vehicle using technology that nobody else has. Since then Fisker has talked about delays to the promised solid state battery technology, which he does not expect to be able to be produced in volume until at least 2025. Posing risk for competition from more scientifically experienced future solid state battery producers such as Quantumscape.

***Forbes:*** ‚ÄúNow he‚Äôs back‚Äìand three things are different. First and foremost, he has a vital new partner: his wife, cofounder and Fisker Inc. CFO Geeta Gupta-Fisker. Second, his Los Angeles-based company is public this time around, raising more than $1 billion in an October 2020 IPO. And finally, Fisker‚Äôs stock price, up 56% since its debut, has made both Henrik and Geeta billionaires, each worth about $1.1 billion as of Friday‚Äôs market close. The auto industry has seen father-son and sibling leadership teams, but Fisker Inc.‚Äôs CEO-CFO combo is the fast-changing sector‚Äôs first husband and wife power couple.‚Äù

Wealth isn‚Äôt the purpose of the new company, Henrik says. ‚ÄúI never got into cars because of money. (This shows he is willing to do what is in the best interest of the company because he is not motivated by money, unlike 99% of other CEO‚Äôs)

The couple sought a big stake in the new venture to ensure they can control its fate in a way Fisker couldn‚Äôt with his earlier company.

Henrik is an auto industry celebrity, but Geeta‚Äôs background is equally impressive. A native of India, she holds multiple degrees in science, including a Ph.D. in biotechnology from Cambridge University where she was also a Research Newton Fellow. From there, she started a career in international investment for Lloyds Banking Group, and then managed investments for a high-net-worth client for several years. (In particular, this is insanely important - Geeta **KNOWS MONEY**! She knows how best to keep a company afloat, organize its share structure, provide value to shareholders, etc. because she has worked in the industry before. She may just be the most important element of Fisker Inc., due to the financial experience she has. At every step of the way, she is likely to make decisions with one sole focus - increasing share price and value).

She met her future husband in 2011 when he was visiting London, just before things started going very wrong at Fisker Automotive. They married in 2012.

‚ÄúWhen I left Fisker Automotive, all I had was my car,‚Äù Henrik remembers. ‚ÄúI'm in a different position, mainly because of Geeta. Because she cuts the deals.‚Äù

To get the new venture off the ground, the Fiskers invested the majority of their life savings‚Äìan enormous financial risk given the fate of Henrik‚Äôs prior company. Then, just as they were locking in plans for the IPO back in July, they were hit by a highly unwelcome complication: Geeta learned she had early-stage breast cancer.

‚ÄúShe got the call (from her doctor) during a call with investors,‚Äù Henrik says. Despite that bombshell, she continued working with banks and investors in the weeks that followed, even as she underwent two surgical procedures and radiation therapy. Her medical therapy concluded in November.

Henrik, who marvels at her fortitude throughout the health crisis says, ‚Äúshe only missed something like one day of work...That's just how she is. She works tirelessly.‚Äù

## Fisker Ocean

The Fisker Ocean will have a nearly 300-mile range with an 80 kWh battery and a solar panel roof as a range extender, adding approximately 1,000 free miles of range per year. Advanced electronics will be housed under the hood, and the vehicle will incorporate recycled and sustainable materials throughout. Deliveries of the Ocean are scheduled to begin in 2022.

&#x200B;

Fisker has also announced a partnership with Electrify America to ensure Fisker Ocean vehicles will integrate seamlessly with Electrify America charging stations when the e-SUV hits the market. With features such as a solar roof and recycled inner materials, it will be, according to Fisker Inc., the ""world's most sustainable vehicle.""

In 2017, Fisker Inc. announced that it had filed patents on flexible solid-state battery designs. Fisker expected the batteries to be produced on a mass scale around 2020. A prototype of the battery debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018. In October 2018, Fisker announced new funding for battery development through Caterpillar Venture Capital. The solid-state batteries are intended to deliver longer vehicle range and faster charging times.

In 2018, Fisker was named to the board of directors of First Cobalt, a North American cobalt refinery that produces battery materials.

In September 2019, it was announced that Fisker Inc. was partnering with Game of Thrones actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who will serve as a partner and sustainability adviser to Fisker, to work on advanced, affordable, electric mobility models.

&#x200B;

[In addition to being a well-known actor, Coster-Waldau is also the United Nations Development Program Goodwill Ambassador for climate change and other social issues.](https://preview.redd.it/3hssff5vfw171.png?width=451&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebe55e2468c5b63d1bc0ac3c71547219dff5afaa)

Nikolaj wrote this piece about Fisker:

To quote a friend of mine who is a lot smarter than me, architect Bjarke Ingels: ‚ÄúThe idea that sustainability needs to sacrifice quality of life is a flawed one. It‚Äôs a design challenge, a challenge to build something that transforms the idea of sustainability into something that will increase the quality of life for all those around it.‚Äù

One person meeting that challenge is Henrik Fisker, who has designed some of the most iconic cars over the past decades for BMW and others, like the BMW Z8, Aston Martin DB9 and Aston Martin V8 Vantage. He‚Äôs a hero for gas-guzzling supercars. He is a fellow Dane, I am a fan, and we met, of all places, on Twitter.

When we met in person, he described his new project ‚Äî an all-electric luxury SUV ‚Äî and asked me if I would help spread the word on his car. The problem as I see it with most electric cars is that they only accomplish the basics. They get you from point A to B. They run electric so you don‚Äôt pollute while driving, but that‚Äôs it. They are basically unattractive combustion engine cars that have a battery thrown into them ‚Äî and for most of them, a battery with a limited range. What Fisker does is to try to make every part of the car in a sustainable and attractive way, like a full-length solar roof, recycled floor mats and vegan leather seats. It looks incredibly cool and inviting, with a great 250- to 300-mile range, and at a cost of just under $40,000, it‚Äôs a luxury car affordable to a mass market.

I said yes and even became an investor, not only because it‚Äôs a great car but more importantly, I hope and believe it can inspire other companies to actively incorporate sustainability goals into all aspects of their business. Fisker then had the idea of calling me ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù adviser. Which I am not. Just to be clear. Thanks Henrik, sounds cool, but I am an actor and a citizen, and that‚Äôs really it.

And what about Hollywood? Is our industry changing, are we at the forefront? Looking at social media, you would think so. And things are happening, but usually only when a camera is pointed at people. Remember a few years back when all awards shows only used EVs for the red carpet? We made a difference. We mattered. We showed the way. So cool. So green, so ‚Ä¶ brief. Now it‚Äôs back to the Escalade. But hey, we are not using plastic straws anymore!

To believe that change will come from Hollywood is not really based in reality (when did that stop us?), but we are great at reacting ‚Äî and things around us are changing, and changing us. I have a good friend who loves his SUV. It‚Äôs not electric. But he cannot give up his car. He is a good guy, he‚Äôs works for the U.N., so if he has a problem going electric, we all do. But if he is presented with an alternative that doesn‚Äôt mean a reduction in his quality of life, something like the Fisker SUV, I think he‚Äôd transition to electric in a heartbeat.

The IPO deal values Fisker Inc at US$2.9 billion, with an IPO share price of $10.

On July 30, 2020, Fisker announced plans for a four-vehicle portfolio by 2025. The Fisker Ocean SUV will be joined by a sports sedan based on their previously announced Fisker Emotion concept, a coupe-like SUV, and a lifestyle pickup truck. All will be electric vehicles.

On October 15, 2020, Fisker Inc announced it would be outsourcing vehicle production of its Fisker Ocean electric SUV to Magna Steyr, to reduce the complexities and costs related to the building and operating its own factory. Magna will start building the Fisker Ocean in Europe in 2022.

## Henrik Fisker Interview quotes:

I have people on Twitter saying, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just make the car next month? You have a prototype.‚Äù Most people don‚Äôt understand that it takes 18 months to do long-lead body tooling for high-volume vehicles. Most people don‚Äôt understand it takes two years to do durability tests and do all the engineering certification and everything else.

And on the business model itself, I believe that there is nobody in the near future or the next couple of years that‚Äôs going to make a million EVs on one model. Today, there‚Äôs nobody doing it. Tesla probably has the highest volume of one single model, a couple hundred thousand. But even the big giant established carmakers are not making, right now, a couple hundred thousand vehicles of one model. So the way you get volume, in my view, is if you partner up with other OEMs and share some of the expensive parts of the platform, which in my view is not anymore something that is unique IP or something that is a unique experience to the customer. An aluminum stamped floor or a steel stamped floor really doesn‚Äôt have any brand value anymore.

And obviously, as we move forward, we always start to do some of the things ourselves. But it was really about de-risking in our first vehicle to market. So we‚Äôre going to do another three vehicles, which we can do because we don‚Äôt have to spend all our money and effort on learning how to manufacture a car, for instance.

So we have programmed a lot. We have hired a head of ESG, environmental and social governance, and he is really spearheading developing specific... we kind of put out some goals that we would like to reach with suppliers, and we at least try to bring them in that direction. They are not reaching those goals right now, but they may reach them later. And then we have goals for ourselves. So for instance, we look at transport. Are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs closer to the plant, or are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs on the other side of the planet that way we have to then transport all that stuff. So those are the types of things that we‚Äôre really thinking about now as we‚Äôre nominating suppliers. And finally, materials as well, looking at sustainable materials. We‚Äôve actually picked up a lot of knowledge on that side as well, where we are adding more sustainable materials to our vehicle. So we are actually looking across everything ‚Äî supply chain, where the suppliers are located, what the suppliers are doing for sustainability, and also then of course in the vehicle itself ‚Äî in terms of the type of materials there.

So - let's summarize - prices are rising at their fastest pace in almost 30 years and incomes just plunged by their most ever! We're gonna need more stimmies!""  

Plus  to above; 

Last year, Hirschman Capital noted that since 1821, 98% of sovereigns that hit 130% debt/GDP have defaulted on their sovereign debt.   

The US hit 130% late last year. 

Simple Conclussion : The Fed can‚Äôt go ‚Äúhawkish‚Äù and raise rates without sending markets ‚Äìand economies‚Äìto their knees; by extension, they now have nothing left to ‚Äúcut‚Äù when the current everything bubble implodes.

And that  is a *real problem*.

 There are only two ways for sovereigns to default: 

Inflation or collapse.    

The latter is not an option. 

 As for a solution, what‚Äôs so tragic is that the only option before the Fed is an even bigger problem‚Äîcurrent and inevitably more inflation. 

 That is, if the Fed wants to keep markets (and their job security) breathing, they no longer have the foregoing template of ‚Äúrate-hike-followed-by-rate-cutting‚Äù at their disposal, which means they now have no choice but to dovishly keep rates near the zero-bound indefinitely.

But the only way to keep rates ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù and nailed to the floor of time is to purchase otherwise unwanted bonds to keep their prices elevated and hence yields and rates repressed.

Such bond ‚Äúaccommodation,‚Äù of course, costs money, and as we already know, the only ‚Äúmoney‚Äù the Fed has to spend is the kind they create out of thin air‚Äì the very kind of money (and policy) which leads to the kind of inflation discussed above‚Äînamely, the brutal kind.

 As for that fake money, the evidence of the Fed‚Äôs desperate (and only) direction is now obvious, as the following M2 money supply makes equally clear. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v774ta55sw171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e73c839beb67a67eea9aed7de4ac61d86813840

 

Fed is so embarrassed by this ‚Äúprinting solution‚Äù that they‚Äôve stopped *weekly* reporting of M2 data, and frankly, since March, have even stopped *monthly* reporting of the same.

That, of course, is both telling as well as disgraceful‚Ä¶ The Fed literally has something to hide, and that never bodes well, does it?

&#x200B;

 The correlation to central bank balance sheet (i.e., money supply) expansion and rising markets is now beyond dispute. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sgizb6xcsw171.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=aad2fe681fe0c49ac20368aba77e86c118b22959

 In short‚Äîdo you see the correlation and pattern? Do you see how the Fed‚Äôs market sausage is made? More importantly, do you now see the Fed‚Äôs self-made conundrum? 

 

Given that the Fed bows to the markets not the people, which choice do you think they‚Äôll make?

In other words, expect more money printing and more yield curve control‚Äîand hence more money creation, more inflation, and by extension more fiat currency debasement.

 More money supply to keep rates monetized simply means more currency debasement and rising inflation.",nn51ou,"""Fed's ""Favorite"" #Inflation Indicator (PCE) Explodes At Fastest Rate Since 1992 As Incomes Crash By Record"""

I have leading indicators telling me that there are two concurrent shifts underway when it comes to who is purchasing homes.

\- Massive increase in unmarried people buying houses alone. This used to be somewhat unusual, now it's becoming very common.

\- Massive increase in unmarried men, in particular, buying houses alone. Traditionally, the female-to-male ratio of unmarried homebuyers was about 5 to 1. For the last 3 months, it's been closer to 50/50.

Source is my own closed real estate purchase transactions. Am a mortgage broker (btw this means cash purchases are ""invisible"" to me). It takes 3-6 months for [HMDA data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Mortgage_Disclosure_Act) to become accessible to journalists and academics, and thus ""visible"" to the general public (assuming journalists deem it worthy of commenting on), but I can see the trends live in real time.

How would one go about placing a bet that in about 3 or 6 months, the media, journalists, academics, etc, will pick up on this, publish articles, and potentially cause a lot of people to buy certain stocks. Which stocks would that be? Is there a ""Mancave, Inc"" out there that would potentially get an uptick? Or maybe a company making smart-home stuff that is particularly suited to renting by the room (the single men are not buying 1 bedroom condos, they are buying proper houses with 3 bedrooms, etc)?

EDIT: oh, and to be clear. It's not just an uptick in single men. It's an uptick in women too, but a massive surge from the men. It used to be that for 15 banana sales, 10 are to married couples, 4 to single women, and 1 to a single man.

More sports betting on the Draftkings sportsbook and the Draftkings Daily fantasy will increase earnings for the company which is almost always good for stock growth. Since the stadiums are open now there is a more emotional energy with sports right now and that is making people make emotional bets on DraftKings.

If the shares are counted by votes which is supposed to happen on 6/2/21, then all the Hedgefunds have to do is not vote, right? How does share voting/count work? 

How will they prove that synthetic shares exist if not many people participate in the count? Is it mandatory?

5821,,2021-05-29 00:24:44,t3_nnbgwu,,wallstreetbets,"Like many of you guys on here, I initially missed out on the GameStop (GME) squeeze. Since the original hype of GME died down, I decided to play around with the stock market so I wouldn‚Äôt miss out on the next opportunity to make some money. 

I have been doing research and talking to as many people I can that have some sort of experience/knowledge when dealing with the stock market. I heard about the potential to get into AMC and make some serious profit. I invested early on when shares were selling for around $8.00. I kept reading we need to hold until June 2nd and reevaluate. That‚Äôs my current plan, but hey I don‚Äôt know much about the game lol.

My current understanding of why there is a squeeze is because of previous events which backed hedge funds into a corner. Basically the hedge funds have had to borrow shares to pay off debt to companies like GME. When borrowing those shares, hedge fund companies left themselves vulnerable because they have no more money to borrow to pay off their debt. So if everyone buys stock in AMC and holds it, then the hedge fund companies are forced to pay out. The more people that buy and hold their shares then the higher the shares are worth and over time it will pay a profit. 

Like I said, I‚Äôm new to the game and this is just my current understanding of how the masses can manipulate the stock market. Please comment and enlighten me on another view point or correct my understanding. Let‚Äôs all get rich and work together with the power of knowledge!

1. Next Monday markets close. Definitely a gap up.

2. June 3 Tesla delivery event. Not even sure what it is but definitely a huge catalyst.

3. IV is only 40ish. Definitely a signal to yolo on TSLA calls.

It was on a Thursday night 02/25/2021 when I posted, at the time RKT was around 19-20 range and on the following Monday 03/01/2021 it started rallying, by 03/02 & 03/03 it hit the ATH level 43. You‚Äôre welcome to find my last DD post for verification. And for those of you who made tendies on it congratulations to you all! Spread the good energy!

As I am writing this post Today is 05/28/2021, I‚Äôll try to bring more data and technical analysis on $RKT, as you all saw what happened yesterday 05/27/2021 around lunch time upon sudden move it went from 17.50 area all the way to 19.40. This move doesn‚Äôt seem so random at all, a combination of someone noticed this to be a strategic technical squeeze just testing the water after it being suppressed down for the past 3 months, and you can see how fast the shorts started covering all of a sudden.

Today 05/28/2021, at opening it shot up to $19.20 but the shorts came prepared for $RKT this morning with their analysts and news blasting numerous articles and downgrades from Morgan Stanley, Wedbush & Zacks, ALL AT ONCE. This is certainly no coincidence.

On the technical side, on the daily chart as you can see it has a gap to fill around 22.67 area then it‚Äôll go straight to 28 and has a huge potential to pass beyond that and make it to a new all-time high, there‚Äôs nothing stopping it. On the daily MACD closed red and turned green, RSI is at the same level as last time before it squeezed to ATH $43, Parabolic S.A.R indicator flipped from red on the daily to green for the first time in 3 months. Another important factor is as you look at the volume and candle compared to last time it exploded (both red arrows) same volume, same price action.

Conclusion: the shorts are basically scared sh\*tless right now and they know it, is a tickle to the trigger for it to explode again like last time or even higher. Based on Excess Returns Model the fair value for RKT is $85, so why haven't we seen $100 yet?

#BUT

If you will excuse just a tiny bit of my snobbery I have a small critique about any canned coffee. Coffee has a lot of volatile aromatic compounds. As soon as espresso is extracted, the volatiles start evaporating. the espresso also starts oxidising as soon as its extracted. Although the espresso/coffee drink is sealed inside the can, by the time it starbucks or other brands goes from extracting the espresso to actually sealing the drink away, a lot of damage is already done. Its not ideal but its not necessarily bad. If it gets the job done for you then who am I to judge :)",,

Everyone is talking about how the squeeze didn't even happen and the shorts didn't cover yet. What I don't understand is why wouldn't that be possible? If short interest is 17%, so let's round up to about 100M shares. Today the volume traded was 700M shares. Couldn't 100M of those 700M have been the shorts covering? And if they didn't cover, today alone 700M shares were traded, why would 100M shares bought by shorts cause a squeeze if today 700M were traded?

I have been having this question for awhile, since I noticed the same with GME. In the days preceding January 28th (when GME reached its peak), the combined volume was several times the amount of float. How come the squeeze happened and why did it happen? If the volume was so high, couldn't the shorts have covered in the days preceding that?

I hope this makes sense and I really hope someone will be kind enough to explain a fellow retard who only knows about crayons what this all means.

Everything looked to have gone off successfully. We are now waiting on the data and craft to be analysed and inspected. This will take a few weeks according to Michael Colglazier.
That being said he had already outlined the test schedule in the earnings zoom call.

1st test flight - may 
2nd crewed flight - June 
3rd flight with R Branson on board late June/July 

4th flight this will be taking the Italian airforce on a training mission (600k a seat) late July


On the run in to the first test flight some possible maintenance issues appeared with the carrier plane White knight 2‚Ä¶. 
This indeed could have gone either way , after 2 weeks inspections it was decided that WK2 did not need to delay testing no maintenance was needed at this point. Scheduled Maintenance will commence in the fall after all tests have been completed.
Upon this news it is my opinion that the testing programme will go ahead as planned.

The market has responded accordingly and the stock is now up from $17-‚Ç¨31

With all these catalysts lined up before the end of the year and commercial operations looming for early 2022 things are looking up for Virgin Galactic.The success of the last test flight the company have now proven tech and concept. 
Also with revenue now coming in Nasa who are conducting micro gravity analysis.
Also international training for military pilots and astronauts.
Commercial flights look imminent.

I had a look at $BB and assume that we finally formed the bottom. In the last few days we saw a sharp rise which might continue in the next weeks. If we can break the 12$ resistance, the next targets would be aroung 25-28$. 

Using Elliot wave theory we are probably at the end of the correction wave 4 and now began with the bullish wave 5.

Price targets:

\#1 12$

\#2 25$

6304,,2021-05-28 09:17:32,t3_nmtt43,,wallstreetbets,"Trainline has taken a huge dip since the UK government's announcement of the plan to nationalise the railway network. The plan includes creating an online ticketing platform by Great British Railways which might have a huge blow on Trainline revenue. However, this platform does not yet exist and will probably take a couple of years to develop. Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed.

In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales.  Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%.

I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time  for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

This is my first time making a post here, please do give constructive feedback and criticism.

6309,,2021-05-28 10:41:01,t3_nmuzzi,,wallstreetbets,"Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent of Modernas if not more. Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects) 

Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

Imagine if the spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize one piece to understand the whole picture it and helps modify your DNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates it can still recognize the virus. In contrast to using one portion of the picture as it mutates it's easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine, that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. Not only that but they have had the least amount of side effects of any covid vaccine deeming it the safest covid vaccine.... 

And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein (whole picture) and the safety profile. Also worth a mention is that you could store it in a regular refrigerator, and let it sit out in room temperature while you're vaccinating people instead of a special ultra low temp freeze needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers, this is a majority of the world. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines so other protein competitors will be far behind and they will have an a moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing they teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine. They will be combining flu and covid vaccine by 2025 for possibly double the price of current covid vaccine.

 They are pretty much de-risked at this point. Yes you could buy other  biotechs that can go up 20x but are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up) that has all successful trials done so far, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment to where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place there are no more glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""

They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. Yesterday at market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. 
 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

Future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract in there ( in the link below in another message). It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 

As far as my position I own some $200 July calls along with about 933 shares. I'm all in baby.  Been in since $4.06, I panicked and sold once during February a couple months during the mini bear market we had and got back in a bit too early so got a wash sale üôà but I'm diamond hands all the way to $800 from here.  LFG I expect to turn that into a cool million in a year's time via shares and options based on the DD provided. Just know this isn't all completely my DD some of this is taken from my good friends at the community Nvax community on Stocktwits. They're one of the most hardcore groups that provides excellent DD and are always willing to help each other a hand if anyone's got questions highly recommend to check it out. So my point is this is information collected over the months that is a group consensus on nvax future price. (Check out next link below this paragraph, it has My positions and an amazing DD chart converting contracts to future price and comparing with competitors. My screen name on stovktwits  is the same on there Johnnyknowsbest. Been on there and here since i started with nvax.

Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. This is huge as the combo is going to differentiate them especially since both flu and covid vaccines are first in class.

Abs Gamma Strike: Unchanged

""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior.""
2) Being that we do not have access to a 10-K filing for Q4 fiscal '19, we will access other filings that do in fact reference numbers from fiscal '19...

3) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $223.3M under Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19)
But, that is TOTAL Revenue; we need to find out what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike sales...
4) To calculate what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike Sales, we can use numbers from neighboring Q3 (i.e. Three Months Ended March 31, 2019)...
A) On page 6 of the 10-Q, you will find Revenue of ""Connected Fitness Products"" (aka Bike Sales) to be $261.6M

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote... By mid-July, we‚Äôll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase precious metals  especially silver amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative 

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

Gold rose over 60% in the 1930s as the prices of stocks and real estate crashed. You could buy an entire block with a one ounce gold coin. Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms.

I must address Cramer's statement because he is obviously trying to add fuel to the short-selling fire: When he says ""we're not going natural gas"" he is clearly making a vague and general statement meant to be interpreted in the worst possible way: ""no one is going to buy or use natural gas."" By now, I hope everyone that is interested in this stock understands that CLNE offers an alternative transportation fuel, thus, the investments made by BP and Chevron, and not revolutionary technology like some EV's (but this is mostly hype meant to catapult EVs to the front. What most people do not realize is that driverless technology and such can be placed in Petro vehicles too). Also, unfortunately, the company has done a terrible marketting job. That's why powerful analysts can get away with making vague and unsupported statements. The fact that Cramer explained the stock's decrease over the last month as being due to widespread dissaproval is misleading, at best. Many people do not yet know about the cleanliness and therapeutic effects RNG has on the climate.

The News...

If you haven't read yet it looks like Federal Cannabis legalization my be around the corner. [Here](https://www.mpp.org/policy/federal/the-more-act/) is the House Bill. Supporters seem on board and like the reforms they have done to the bill including rescheduling cannabis. [Last time](https://mjbizdaily.com/key-us-house-lawmaker-reintroduces-federal-marijuana-legalization-bill/) the bill was introduced it cleared the House.   


Personally I think this gets a lot of support especially from a fiscal point of view. With stimulus stalling and a giant debate going on about how to pay for the stimulus I think cannabis offers the easiest way to collect federal revenue. A simple review of the bill and the fiscal benefits to the Fed's can be read [here](https://www.justtherealnews.com/congress/nadler-blumenauer-lee-jackson-lee-jeffries-velazquez-reintroduce-comprehensive-marijuana-reform-legislation/). The bill states a 5% fed tax. Money coming for uncle Sam, right when questions about paying for stimulus.... Personally I think it adds up, but that's for you to decide. 

Okay so that's the hype...

Let's talk about the tickers listed ($SNDL and $TLRY). 

$SNDL

I'll start with the cheaper YOLO, $SNDL. $SNDL short interest isn't high, but the company did issue convertible notes a while back around .7c if my memory is correct. I'm not saying they won't do it again, but they should be in a good place fiscally for now. Float is high with about 1.6B shares out there. However today's volume at the time of writing is over 415M. That's not bad given such a high float. It's about 200% more than the average volume. 

The options chain on $SNDL has me giddy. With over 200,000 options currently in the money on todays move above $1 there is some high potential here for some interesting action. The put to call ratio is just obnoxiously low at .08 it's screaming upwards betting. If we hold above $1 the potential squeeze up could be amazing.   


It's also broken up on the trend lines and out of the downward channel it was in. The regression channel from the peak squeeze back in Feb just broke out today according to my crayons I have laying around. 

$TLRY

$TLRY was the squeeze of a lifetime if you remember it back in 19'. The ticker was just a money printer with it's low float and stupid hype. Then they proceeded to do, like they all do, and issue debt. Shares tumbled since then falling from $120 --> $5. Ouch bag holders.   


Like all the cannabis stocks the Feb bump pushed $TLRY to above $60 in an amazing move. $TLRY has a lower short interest than $SNDL, but it also has a much lower float at about 300M. Compared to $SNDL the volume here isn't as good, but still remains decently above the avg volume around 36M as of right now. 

If we peep the options chain we also see a crazy low P/C ratio around .11. But we don't have the Open Interest in the chain like $SNDL does unless you roll out to Jun 18. Then we finally get some decent OI.   


Personally I am going with $SNDL. The option's chain looks better, the stock is cheaper, and the short interest is a little better. My advice would be to roll out till at least the Jun 11th $1 strike to not get eaten alive by Theta and IV crush. But WSB does what WSB wants and that's why I love you all.   
Do not go above the $2 strikes IMO. You will get crushed by theta unless we get an insane move, which could happen but I don't see the risk / reward there.",nn326f,MORE ACT / CANNABIS / $SNDL & $TLRY Potential

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday

>Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers‚Äô attempt to corner the market on the metal.

-
>Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926‚Äì2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers‚Äô Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.

-
>By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged‚ÄîMarch 27‚Äîsilver fell to $10.80, the metal‚Äôs biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, ‚ÄúA billion dollars isn‚Äôt what it used to be,‚Äù the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.

-
>To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978‚Äì91) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities.",nn36fw,There is no silver short squeeze happening.

* Henrik has learned from all the mistakes he made with his previous attempt to create Fisker Automotive, and will certainly do everything in his power to avoid that mess again. He has designed systems into the intricacies of the company to avoid failure - meaning Fisker Inc is guaranteed to succeed

* Large Fleet market in Europe gaining momentum, and 700+ Fisker reservations in this market alone
* 16,000+ reservations already. More than Tesla had 18 months pre-production
* Revenue streams include leasing automotives, servicing, selling emissions credits, selling insurance (like selling the pickaxe to miners, and selling the diamonds to the mine owners too, absolutely genius - Fisker are insuring cars which they own, because the customer is only leasing it)
* High short interest (20%+), high analyst price targets compared to current share price (100%+) and low valuation compared to peers ($3bn market cap currently)
* Designing the first ever all-electric popemobile - Massive, soon to be historic, event!
* I give $FSR (currently $13 a share) a price target of $100 by end of year 2022, if not sooner
* Price Targets: $35 by end of year - Previous ATH. $50 start of next year - European and Chinese debut of prototypes. $100 end of 2022 - start of production (SOP). $150+ 2023
* 2025 Price Targets, calculated using projected data: Bear case - $97 a share, Bull case - $519 a share
* Downside in the short term is capped by the large amount of cash on hand - one third of market cap is cash. Long term, is capped by risk factors, which are almost eligible and affect every automotive startup anyway.

## Fisker Automotive

In 2008, Fisker Automotive raised over $90 million from investors including venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. In September 2009, Fisker Automotive was awarded a $528 million loan guarantee by the United States Department of Energy (DOE). The automaker was one of four recipients of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, to encourage the domestic manufacture of electric cars. The funds were to be used to develop the Karma, as well as an affordable family-size plug-in hybrid car. The loan facility was frozen at $192 million in February 2012, after the DOE claimed that Fisker missed its milestones

In December 2011, just as the Fisker Karma was launched, its battery supplier, A123 Systems, recalled all batteries, followed by a second recall in 2012. A123 filed for bankruptcy in October 2012, leaving Fisker Automotive without a battery supplier. After selling approximately 2,000 units, production of the Fisker Karma was suspended in November 2012, in the absence of its battery supplier.

&#x200B;

Henrik Fisker resigned as chairman from Fisker Automotive in March 2013, because of disagreements with management about business strategy. Later that year, the company declared voluntary bankruptcy.Fisker raised and spent more than a billion dollars over its lifetime.The heart of Fisker‚Äôs business model was in that early deal with Quantum. The idea was to design a gorgeous car, and have suppliers like Quantum provide the technology because off-the-shelf parts from suppliers would help keep costs down.

But there were problems with this strategy: Sometimes, those parts had to be custom-made to fit the design vision, which resulted in higher prices for Fisker. Other times, parts were delivered late or, worse, faulty, but Fisker was locked in to those supplier relationships. Sources close to Fisker have also said that many of the parts were owned by the suppliers themselves, so Fisker didn‚Äôt own a lot of the internal technology.

The broker that raised funds for Fisker automotive, by selling their private shares, was Advanced Equities.It wasn‚Äôt until December 2011 and into 2012 that the more dubious efforts of Advanced Equities became clearer to Fisker‚Äôs hundreds of investors. The last few hundred million dollars of Advanced Equities‚Äô fund raising for Fisker, starting with the D-1 round, was what brokers call ‚Äúpay to play.‚Äù As Fisker was running into technical, delivery and political problems, its valuation was quickly declining. But the company still needed more money, so the brokers went back to its current investors and said: Unless you give this more, your current shares will be diluted and your preferred stock will be converted to common stock.

It was essentially a gun to their heads. This is why investor Wray sued Fisker in February 2012, alleging he was on the receiving end of this tactic. In his lawsuit, he says Advanced Equities sent him a letter dated Jan. 18, 2012, stating that he needed to decide if he wanted to invest in Fisker‚Äôs next round, and pay around $84,000 by Jan. 27, 2012 ‚Äî a little over a week from receiving the letter. He also says that Advanced Equities assured him that he would have anti-dilution protection. According to the audio clip from Advanced Equities‚Äô internal sales call in early 2010, Advanced Equity leaders say that the Fisker deal will ‚Äúsuffer no dilution,‚Äù and was ‚Äúa dream scenario.‚Äù

That dream would soon end. In September 2012 after Fisker closed on $1.2 billion in funding, the bulk of it organized by Advanced Equities, the SEC charged the broker with misleading investors when it raised money for another company back in 2009 and 2010 (Bloom Energy). Advanced settled, agreeing to pay $1 million, and its co-founders were personally fined. Two months later Advanced Equities closed up shop.

Later, A123 Systems itself went bankrupt, causing more problems for Fisker. Fisker claimed that A123 Systems owed it $140 million, but a bankruptcy settlement reduced that to a paltry $15 million.

Then there was the just plain terrible luck for the ironically named Karma: Super Storm Sandy wiped out 338 of its Karmas in storage in New Jersey. The cars first drowned, and then caught on fire ‚Äî salt water damage caused a short circuit that was spread to other cars by high winds, Fisker said at the time.

With all of this happening in public ‚Äî and in a presidential election year ‚Äî Fisker‚Äôs struggles became highly politicized. The company was mentioned numerous times in presidential debates and speeches leading up to the election. Republican nominee Romney called Fisker and other DOE-supported companies losers.

The company didn‚Äôt seem to invest substantially in technology innovation or tech IP, and seemed to spend a disproportionate amount on suppliers. For example, numerous sources have said that the company paid upfront for 15,000 of some of the parts for its planned 15,000 Karmas. It ended up only selling around 2,000 of the cars. It has also been said that Fisker paid some funds upfront to have BMW make engines for the 100,000 Nina cars it hoped to produce ‚Äî in the end, Fisker didn‚Äôt deliver a single Nina.

Costs to build each Karma also creeped up because the company missed its volume targets, and because engineering had to change designs around supplier constraints. The company ended up adding $20,000 to its initial sale price.

Expensive hires may also have sucked away chunks of Fisker‚Äôs funding: Sources say that Fisker filled the upper levels of the company with seasoned auto executives from Detroit. At the high point of Fisker, the company had around 300 employees, plus dozens of contract staff. Bringing in a certain amount of the old guard could help a car startup ramp up quickly, and also impress potential investors with ‚Äúindustry names.‚Äù But those people are also used to big auto-industry budgets that included extensive travel and salaries ‚Äî that‚Äôs the opposite life of a tech startup.

## Fisker Inc.

In July 2016, Henrik Fisker expressed interest in designing a fully connected electric car with autonomous driving features and an aesthetically pleasing look. He has pursued battery technology, and hinted at potentially reviving the Fisker name with a pure-electric vehicle using technology that nobody else has. Since then Fisker has talked about delays to the promised solid state battery technology, which he does not expect to be able to be produced in volume until at least 2025. Posing risk for competition from more scientifically experienced future solid state battery producers such as Quantumscape.

***Forbes:*** ‚ÄúNow he‚Äôs back‚Äìand three things are different. First and foremost, he has a vital new partner: his wife, cofounder and Fisker Inc. CFO Geeta Gupta-Fisker. Second, his Los Angeles-based company is public this time around, raising more than $1 billion in an October 2020 IPO. And finally, Fisker‚Äôs stock price, up 56% since its debut, has made both Henrik and Geeta billionaires, each worth about $1.1 billion as of Friday‚Äôs market close. The auto industry has seen father-son and sibling leadership teams, but Fisker Inc.‚Äôs CEO-CFO combo is the fast-changing sector‚Äôs first husband and wife power couple.‚Äù

Wealth isn‚Äôt the purpose of the new company, Henrik says. ‚ÄúI never got into cars because of money. (This shows he is willing to do what is in the best interest of the company because he is not motivated by money, unlike 99% of other CEO‚Äôs)

The couple sought a big stake in the new venture to ensure they can control its fate in a way Fisker couldn‚Äôt with his earlier company.

Henrik is an auto industry celebrity, but Geeta‚Äôs background is equally impressive. A native of India, she holds multiple degrees in science, including a Ph.D. in biotechnology from Cambridge University where she was also a Research Newton Fellow. From there, she started a career in international investment for Lloyds Banking Group, and then managed investments for a high-net-worth client for several years. (In particular, this is insanely important - Geeta **KNOWS MONEY**! She knows how best to keep a company afloat, organize its share structure, provide value to shareholders, etc. because she has worked in the industry before. She may just be the most important element of Fisker Inc., due to the financial experience she has. At every step of the way, she is likely to make decisions with one sole focus - increasing share price and value).

She met her future husband in 2011 when he was visiting London, just before things started going very wrong at Fisker Automotive. They married in 2012.

‚ÄúWhen I left Fisker Automotive, all I had was my car,‚Äù Henrik remembers. ‚ÄúI'm in a different position, mainly because of Geeta. Because she cuts the deals.‚Äù

To get the new venture off the ground, the Fiskers invested the majority of their life savings‚Äìan enormous financial risk given the fate of Henrik‚Äôs prior company. Then, just as they were locking in plans for the IPO back in July, they were hit by a highly unwelcome complication: Geeta learned she had early-stage breast cancer.

‚ÄúShe got the call (from her doctor) during a call with investors,‚Äù Henrik says. Despite that bombshell, she continued working with banks and investors in the weeks that followed, even as she underwent two surgical procedures and radiation therapy. Her medical therapy concluded in November.

Henrik, who marvels at her fortitude throughout the health crisis says, ‚Äúshe only missed something like one day of work...That's just how she is. She works tirelessly.‚Äù

## Fisker Ocean

The Fisker Ocean will have a nearly 300-mile range with an 80 kWh battery and a solar panel roof as a range extender, adding approximately 1,000 free miles of range per year. Advanced electronics will be housed under the hood, and the vehicle will incorporate recycled and sustainable materials throughout. Deliveries of the Ocean are scheduled to begin in 2022.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s87j6bdsfw171.png?width=438&format=png&auto=webp&s=e40add9ce53319d31db242cce73a303afb03cbab

Fisker has also announced a partnership with Electrify America to ensure Fisker Ocean vehicles will integrate seamlessly with Electrify America charging stations when the e-SUV hits the market. With features such as a solar roof and recycled inner materials, it will be, according to Fisker Inc., the ""world's most sustainable vehicle.""

In 2017, Fisker Inc. announced that it had filed patents on flexible solid-state battery designs. Fisker expected the batteries to be produced on a mass scale around 2020. A prototype of the battery debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018. In October 2018, Fisker announced new funding for battery development through Caterpillar Venture Capital. The solid-state batteries are intended to deliver longer vehicle range and faster charging times.

In 2018, Fisker was named to the board of directors of First Cobalt, a North American cobalt refinery that produces battery materials.

In September 2019, it was announced that Fisker Inc. was partnering with Game of Thrones actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who will serve as a partner and sustainability adviser to Fisker, to work on advanced, affordable, electric mobility models.

&#x200B;

[In addition to being a well-known actor, Coster-Waldau is also the United Nations Development Program Goodwill Ambassador for climate change and other social issues.](https://preview.redd.it/3hssff5vfw171.png?width=451&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebe55e2468c5b63d1bc0ac3c71547219dff5afaa)

Nikolaj wrote this piece about Fisker:

To quote a friend of mine who is a lot smarter than me, architect Bjarke Ingels: ‚ÄúThe idea that sustainability needs to sacrifice quality of life is a flawed one. It‚Äôs a design challenge, a challenge to build something that transforms the idea of sustainability into something that will increase the quality of life for all those around it.‚Äù

One person meeting that challenge is Henrik Fisker, who has designed some of the most iconic cars over the past decades for BMW and others, like the BMW Z8, Aston Martin DB9 and Aston Martin V8 Vantage. He‚Äôs a hero for gas-guzzling supercars. He is a fellow Dane, I am a fan, and we met, of all places, on Twitter.

When we met in person, he described his new project ‚Äî an all-electric luxury SUV ‚Äî and asked me if I would help spread the word on his car. The problem as I see it with most electric cars is that they only accomplish the basics. They get you from point A to B. They run electric so you don‚Äôt pollute while driving, but that‚Äôs it. They are basically unattractive combustion engine cars that have a battery thrown into them ‚Äî and for most of them, a battery with a limited range. What Fisker does is to try to make every part of the car in a sustainable and attractive way, like a full-length solar roof, recycled floor mats and vegan leather seats. It looks incredibly cool and inviting, with a great 250- to 300-mile range, and at a cost of just under $40,000, it‚Äôs a luxury car affordable to a mass market.

I said yes and even became an investor, not only because it‚Äôs a great car but more importantly, I hope and believe it can inspire other companies to actively incorporate sustainability goals into all aspects of their business. Fisker then had the idea of calling me ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù adviser. Which I am not. Just to be clear. Thanks Henrik, sounds cool, but I am an actor and a citizen, and that‚Äôs really it.

And what about Hollywood? Is our industry changing, are we at the forefront? Looking at social media, you would think so. And things are happening, but usually only when a camera is pointed at people. Remember a few years back when all awards shows only used EVs for the red carpet? We made a difference. We mattered. We showed the way. So cool. So green, so ‚Ä¶ brief. Now it‚Äôs back to the Escalade. But hey, we are not using plastic straws anymore!

To believe that change will come from Hollywood is not really based in reality (when did that stop us?), but we are great at reacting ‚Äî and things around us are changing, and changing us. I have a good friend who loves his SUV. It‚Äôs not electric. But he cannot give up his car. He is a good guy, he‚Äôs works for the U.N., so if he has a problem going electric, we all do. But if he is presented with an alternative that doesn‚Äôt mean a reduction in his quality of life, something like the Fisker SUV, I think he‚Äôd transition to electric in a heartbeat.

The IPO deal values Fisker Inc at US$2.9 billion, with an IPO share price of $10.

On July 30, 2020, Fisker announced plans for a four-vehicle portfolio by 2025. The Fisker Ocean SUV will be joined by a sports sedan based on their previously announced Fisker Emotion concept, a coupe-like SUV, and a lifestyle pickup truck. All will be electric vehicles.

On October 15, 2020, Fisker Inc announced it would be outsourcing vehicle production of its Fisker Ocean electric SUV to Magna Steyr, to reduce the complexities and costs related to the building and operating its own factory. Magna will start building the Fisker Ocean in Europe in 2022.

## Henrik Fisker Interview quotes:

I have people on Twitter saying, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just make the car next month? You have a prototype.‚Äù Most people don‚Äôt understand that it takes 18 months to do long-lead body tooling for high-volume vehicles. Most people don‚Äôt understand it takes two years to do durability tests and do all the engineering certification and everything else.

And on the business model itself, I believe that there is nobody in the near future or the next couple of years that‚Äôs going to make a million EVs on one model. Today, there‚Äôs nobody doing it. Tesla probably has the highest volume of one single model, a couple hundred thousand. But even the big giant established carmakers are not making, right now, a couple hundred thousand vehicles of one model. So the way you get volume, in my view, is if you partner up with other OEMs and share some of the expensive parts of the platform, which in my view is not anymore something that is unique IP or something that is a unique experience to the customer. An aluminum stamped floor or a steel stamped floor really doesn‚Äôt have any brand value anymore.

And obviously, as we move forward, we always start to do some of the things ourselves. But it was really about de-risking in our first vehicle to market. So we‚Äôre going to do another three vehicles, which we can do because we don‚Äôt have to spend all our money and effort on learning how to manufacture a car, for instance.

So we have programmed a lot. We have hired a head of ESG, environmental and social governance, and he is really spearheading developing specific... we kind of put out some goals that we would like to reach with suppliers, and we at least try to bring them in that direction. They are not reaching those goals right now, but they may reach them later. And then we have goals for ourselves. So for instance, we look at transport. Are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs closer to the plant, or are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs on the other side of the planet that way we have to then transport all that stuff. So those are the types of things that we‚Äôre really thinking about now as we‚Äôre nominating suppliers. And finally, materials as well, looking at sustainable materials. We‚Äôve actually picked up a lot of knowledge on that side as well, where we are adding more sustainable materials to our vehicle. So we are actually looking across everything ‚Äî supply chain, where the suppliers are located, what the suppliers are doing for sustainability, and also then of course in the vehicle itself ‚Äî in terms of the type of materials there.

So - let's summarize - prices are rising at their fastest pace in almost 30 years and incomes just plunged by their most ever! We're gonna need more stimmies!""  

Plus  to above; 

Last year, Hirschman Capital noted that since 1821, 98% of sovereigns that hit 130% debt/GDP have defaulted on their sovereign debt.   

The US hit 130% late last year. 

Simple Conclussion : The Fed can‚Äôt go ‚Äúhawkish‚Äù and raise rates without sending markets ‚Äìand economies‚Äìto their knees; by extension, they now have nothing left to ‚Äúcut‚Äù when the current everything bubble implodes.

And that  is a *real problem*.

 There are only two ways for sovereigns to default: 

Inflation or collapse.    

The latter is not an option. 

 As for a solution, what‚Äôs so tragic is that the only option before the Fed is an even bigger problem‚Äîcurrent and inevitably more inflation. 

 That is, if the Fed wants to keep markets (and their job security) breathing, they no longer have the foregoing template of ‚Äúrate-hike-followed-by-rate-cutting‚Äù at their disposal, which means they now have no choice but to dovishly keep rates near the zero-bound indefinitely.

But the only way to keep rates ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù and nailed to the floor of time is to purchase otherwise unwanted bonds to keep their prices elevated and hence yields and rates repressed.

Such bond ‚Äúaccommodation,‚Äù of course, costs money, and as we already know, the only ‚Äúmoney‚Äù the Fed has to spend is the kind they create out of thin air‚Äì the very kind of money (and policy) which leads to the kind of inflation discussed above‚Äînamely, the brutal kind.

 As for that fake money, the evidence of the Fed‚Äôs desperate (and only) direction is now obvious, as the following M2 money supply makes equally clear. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v774ta55sw171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e73c839beb67a67eea9aed7de4ac61d86813840

 

Fed is so embarrassed by this ‚Äúprinting solution‚Äù that they‚Äôve stopped *weekly* reporting of M2 data, and frankly, since March, have even stopped *monthly* reporting of the same.

That, of course, is both telling as well as disgraceful‚Ä¶ The Fed literally has something to hide, and that never bodes well, does it?

&#x200B;

 The correlation to central bank balance sheet (i.e., money supply) expansion and rising markets is now beyond dispute. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sgizb6xcsw171.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=aad2fe681fe0c49ac20368aba77e86c118b22959

 In short‚Äîdo you see the correlation and pattern? Do you see how the Fed‚Äôs market sausage is made? More importantly, do you now see the Fed‚Äôs self-made conundrum? 

 

Given that the Fed bows to the markets not the people, which choice do you think they‚Äôll make?

In other words, expect more money printing and more yield curve control‚Äîand hence more money creation, more inflation, and by extension more fiat currency debasement.

 More money supply to keep rates monetized simply means more currency debasement and rising inflation.",nn51ou,"""Fed's ""Favorite"" #Inflation Indicator (PCE) Explodes At Fastest Rate Since 1992 As Incomes Crash By Record"""

I have leading indicators telling me that there are two concurrent shifts underway when it comes to who is purchasing homes.

\- Massive increase in unmarried people buying houses alone. This used to be somewhat unusual, now it's becoming very common.

\- Massive increase in unmarried men, in particular, buying houses alone. Traditionally, the female-to-male ratio of unmarried homebuyers was about 5 to 1. For the last 3 months, it's been closer to 50/50.

Source is my own closed real estate purchase transactions. Am a mortgage broker (btw this means cash purchases are ""invisible"" to me). It takes 3-6 months for [HMDA data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Mortgage_Disclosure_Act) to become accessible to journalists and academics, and thus ""visible"" to the general public (assuming journalists deem it worthy of commenting on), but I can see the trends live in real time.

How would one go about placing a bet that in about 3 or 6 months, the media, journalists, academics, etc, will pick up on this, publish articles, and potentially cause a lot of people to buy certain stocks. Which stocks would that be? Is there a ""Mancave, Inc"" out there that would potentially get an uptick? Or maybe a company making smart-home stuff that is particularly suited to renting by the room (the single men are not buying 1 bedroom condos, they are buying proper houses with 3 bedrooms, etc)?

EDIT: oh, and to be clear. It's not just an uptick in single men. It's an uptick in women too, but a massive surge from the men. It used to be that for 15 banana sales, 10 are to married couples, 4 to single women, and 1 to a single man.

I‚Äôm asking for a retard friend who saw his in the money AMC calls fucking ballon on today‚Äôs opening run up then fall to shit and expire worthless. 

(Some context) purchased 1 day calls options expiring on 5/28: 10 26$ calls 10 27$ calls 10 28$. 
Note this was the retard‚Äôs first option trade so he was going bananas seeing all the fucking ü§ë tendies. The retard was bullish and let the stock run until it got smack down. Instead of rolling the calls and taking a profit he was hopeful and waiting for the stock to bounce back up. After AMC dropped to 31 then to 26 he said fuck it let it run till then end hoping for one last minute run.

If the shares are counted by votes which is supposed to happen on 6/2/21, then all the Hedgefunds have to do is not vote, right? How does share voting/count work? 

How will they prove that synthetic shares exist if not many people participate in the count? Is it mandatory?

I have been doing research and talking to as many people I can that have some sort of experience/knowledge when dealing with the stock market. I heard about the potential to get into AMC and make some serious profit. I invested early on when shares were selling for around $8.00. I kept reading we need to hold until June 2nd and reevaluate. That‚Äôs my current plan, but hey I don‚Äôt know much about the game lol.

My current understanding of why there is a squeeze is because of previous events which backed hedge funds into a corner. Basically the hedge funds have had to borrow shares to pay off debt to companies like GME. When borrowing those shares, hedge fund companies left themselves vulnerable because they have no more money to borrow to pay off their debt. So if everyone buys stock in AMC and holds it, then the hedge fund companies are forced to pay out. The more people that buy and hold their shares then the higher the shares are worth and over time it will pay a profit. 

Like I said, I‚Äôm new to the game and this is just my current understanding of how the masses can manipulate the stock market. Please comment and enlighten me on another view point or correct my understanding. Let‚Äôs all get rich and work together with the power of knowledge!

It was on a Thursday night 02/25/2021 when I posted, at the time RKT was around 19-20 range and on the following Monday 03/01/2021 it started rallying, by 03/02 & 03/03 it hit the ATH level 43. You‚Äôre welcome to find my last DD post for verification. And for those of you who made tendies on it congratulations to you all! Spread the good energy!

As I am writing this post Today is 05/28/2021, I‚Äôll try to bring more data and technical analysis on $RKT, as you all saw what happened yesterday 05/27/2021 around lunch time upon sudden move it went from 17.50 area all the way to 19.40. This move doesn‚Äôt seem so random at all, a combination of someone noticed this to be a strategic technical squeeze just testing the water after it being suppressed down for the past 3 months, and you can see how fast the shorts started covering all of a sudden.

Today 05/28/2021, at opening it shot up to $19.20 but the shorts came prepared for $RKT this morning with their analysts and news blasting numerous articles and downgrades from Morgan Stanley, Wedbush & Zacks, ALL AT ONCE. This is certainly no coincidence.

On the technical side, on the daily chart as you can see it has a gap to fill around 22.67 area then it‚Äôll go straight to 28 and has a huge potential to pass beyond that and make it to a new all-time high, there‚Äôs nothing stopping it. On the daily MACD closed red and turned green, RSI is at the same level as last time before it squeezed to ATH $43, Parabolic S.A.R indicator flipped from red on the daily to green for the first time in 3 months. Another important factor is as you look at the volume and candle compared to last time it exploded (both red arrows) same volume, same price action.

Conclusion: the shorts are basically scared sh\*tless right now and they know it, is a tickle to the trigger for it to explode again like last time or even higher. Based on Excess Returns Model the fair value for RKT is $85, so why haven't we seen $100 yet?

Not because they're new, or because they spam the daily threads with unoriginal bullshit all week long, but because they're supporting the antithesis of wall WSB means to me.

You see, classic wallstreetbets was a place for autistic burger flippers and office workers to engage in extremely speculative high-leverage stock gambles. It was a place where regular internet trolls could come to engage in hard-core ruthless capitalism for the chance of making tendies. Regular people could cosplay as a coked up 80s stock broker.

Part of the beauty of the community was the ruthlessness of it all, and the solidarity behind that ruthlessness. We were all well aware that we were communicating with other autists who were also trading super leveraged options positions, sometimes on the other side of the same stock. The bears teased the bulls on red days, and the bulls called the bears gay every other day. We all knew what was on the table, and everyone was competing against each other. 

Then these GME kids flooded the sub. They don't want to take highly leveraged positions on random companies. They just want to hold shares. They don't want to take a gamble in the market, they want to take a strategic position on a specific company to guarantee a short squeeze for profit. 

Now putting aside all of that boomer shit, the real major offense is the desire to work as a collective. These guys just want to have a common enemy in ""the hedgies"". 

The beauty of the WSB community was that we don't make enemies or work together or work against each other. IDGAF if anyone else's MU calls print, as long as mine do. And if your MU puts print, I can celebrate your gains while you celebrate my losses. The tendies aren't in the profits you take, they're in the risk you take.

Everyone is talking about how the squeeze didn't even happen and the shorts didn't cover yet. What I don't understand is why wouldn't that be possible? If short interest is 17%, so let's round up to about 100M shares. Today the volume traded was 700M shares. Couldn't 100M of those 700M have been the shorts covering? And if they didn't cover, today alone 700M shares were traded, why would 100M shares bought by shorts cause a squeeze if today 700M were traded?

I have been having this question for awhile, since I noticed the same with GME. In the days preceding January 28th (when GME reached its peak), the combined volume was several times the amount of float. How come the squeeze happened and why did it happen? If the volume was so high, couldn't the shorts have covered in the days preceding that?

I hope this makes sense and I really hope someone will be kind enough to explain a fellow retard who only knows about crayons what this all means.

Everything looked to have gone off successfully. We are now waiting on the data and craft to be analysed and inspected. This will take a few weeks according to Michael Colglazier.
That being said he had already outlined the test schedule in the earnings zoom call.

1st test flight - may 
2nd crewed flight - June 
3rd flight with R Branson on board late June/July 

4th flight this will be taking the Italian airforce on a training mission (600k a seat) late July


On the run in to the first test flight some possible maintenance issues appeared with the carrier plane White knight 2‚Ä¶. 
This indeed could have gone either way , after 2 weeks inspections it was decided that WK2 did not need to delay testing no maintenance was needed at this point. Scheduled Maintenance will commence in the fall after all tests have been completed.
Upon this news it is my opinion that the testing programme will go ahead as planned.

The market has responded accordingly and the stock is now up from $17-‚Ç¨31

I had a look at $BB and assume that we finally formed the bottom. In the last few days we saw a sharp rise which might continue in the next weeks. If we can break the 12$ resistance, the next targets would be aroung 25-28$. 

Using Elliot wave theory we are probably at the end of the correction wave 4 and now began with the bullish wave 5.

Price targets:

6857,,2021-05-28 09:17:32,t3_nmtt43,,wallstreetbets,"Trainline has taken a huge dip since the UK government's announcement of the plan to nationalise the railway network. The plan includes creating an online ticketing platform by Great British Railways which might have a huge blow on Trainline revenue. However, this platform does not yet exist and will probably take a couple of years to develop. Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed.

In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales.  Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%.

I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time  for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

6862,,2021-05-28 10:41:01,t3_nmuzzi,,wallstreetbets,"Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent of Modernas if not more. Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects) 

Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

Imagine if the spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize one piece to understand the whole picture it and helps modify your DNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates it can still recognize the virus. In contrast to using one portion of the picture as it mutates it's easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine, that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. Not only that but they have had the least amount of side effects of any covid vaccine deeming it the safest covid vaccine.... 

And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein (whole picture) and the safety profile. Also worth a mention is that you could store it in a regular refrigerator, and let it sit out in room temperature while you're vaccinating people instead of a special ultra low temp freeze needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers, this is a majority of the world. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines so other protein competitors will be far behind and they will have an a moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing they teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine. They will be combining flu and covid vaccine by 2025 for possibly double the price of current covid vaccine.

 They are pretty much de-risked at this point. Yes you could buy other  biotechs that can go up 20x but are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up) that has all successful trials done so far, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment to where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place there are no more glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""

They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. Yesterday at market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. 
 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

Future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract in there ( in the link below in another message). It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 

As far as my position I own some $200 July calls along with about 933 shares. I'm all in baby.  Been in since $4.06, I panicked and sold once during February a couple months during the mini bear market we had and got back in a bit too early so got a wash sale üôà but I'm diamond hands all the way to $800 from here.  LFG I expect to turn that into a cool million in a year's time via shares and options based on the DD provided. Just know this isn't all completely my DD some of this is taken from my good friends at the community Nvax community on Stocktwits. They're one of the most hardcore groups that provides excellent DD and are always willing to help each other a hand if anyone's got questions highly recommend to check it out. So my point is this is information collected over the months that is a group consensus on nvax future price. (Check out next link below this paragraph, it has My positions and an amazing DD chart converting contracts to future price and comparing with competitors. My screen name on stovktwits  is the same on there Johnnyknowsbest. Been on there and here since i started with nvax.

Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. This is huge as the combo is going to differentiate them especially since both flu and covid vaccines are first in class.

Somebody posted this in the Rite Aid sub. Can one of the more astute people here comment on this? Is this a real possibility? 

The news that leaked that Amazon was interested in physical locations makes me wonder, but they‚Äôve had years to buy Rite Aid, CVS or Walgreens. So far they‚Äôve done nothing but Pillpack, which has been mostly a failure.

1) We look to the PTON CFO's statement found in the latest earnings call transcript, for guidance:
""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior.""
2) Being that we do not have access to a 10-K filing for Q4 fiscal '19, we will access other filings that do in fact reference numbers from fiscal '19...
A) 10-K filing dated 9/11/2020
B) 10-Q filing dated 5/6/2020
3) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $223.3M under Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19)
But, that is TOTAL Revenue; we need to find out what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike sales...
4) To calculate what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike Sales, we can use numbers from neighboring Q3 (i.e. Three Months Ended March 31, 2019)...
A) On page 6 of the 10-Q, you will find Revenue of ""Connected Fitness Products"" (aka Bike Sales) to be $261.6M
B) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $316.7M
C) % of Bike Sales per TOTAL Revenue: $261.6M / $316.7M * 100 = 82.6% {""Connected Fitness Products"" Revenue (aka Bike Sales)}
5) Apply 82.6% to the TOTAL Revenue $223.3M for Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19): $223.3M x 0.826 = $184.45M {Bike Sales for Q4 of fiscal '19}
6) Per the CFO, ""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior."":

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote... By mid-July, we‚Äôll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase precious metals  especially silver amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative 

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

Gold rose over 60% in the 1930s as the prices of stocks and real estate crashed. You could buy an entire block with a one ounce gold coin. Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms.

I must address Cramer's statement because he is obviously trying to add fuel to the short-selling fire: When he says ""we're not going natural gas"" he is clearly making a vague and general statement meant to be interpreted in the worst possible way: ""no one is going to buy or use natural gas."" By now, I hope everyone that is interested in this stock understands that CLNE offers an alternative transportation fuel, thus, the investments made by BP and Chevron, and not revolutionary technology like some EV's (but this is mostly hype meant to catapult EVs to the front. What most people do not realize is that driverless technology and such can be placed in Petro vehicles too). Also, unfortunately, the company has done a terrible marketting job. That's why powerful analysts can get away with making vague and unsupported statements. The fact that Cramer explained the stock's decrease over the last month as being due to widespread dissaproval is misleading, at best. Many people do not yet know about the cleanliness and therapeutic effects RNG has on the climate.

The News...

If you haven't read yet it looks like Federal Cannabis legalization my be around the corner. [Here](https://www.mpp.org/policy/federal/the-more-act/) is the House Bill. Supporters seem on board and like the reforms they have done to the bill including rescheduling cannabis. [Last time](https://mjbizdaily.com/key-us-house-lawmaker-reintroduces-federal-marijuana-legalization-bill/) the bill was introduced it cleared the House.   


Personally I think this gets a lot of support especially from a fiscal point of view. With stimulus stalling and a giant debate going on about how to pay for the stimulus I think cannabis offers the easiest way to collect federal revenue. A simple review of the bill and the fiscal benefits to the Fed's can be read [here](https://www.justtherealnews.com/congress/nadler-blumenauer-lee-jackson-lee-jeffries-velazquez-reintroduce-comprehensive-marijuana-reform-legislation/). The bill states a 5% fed tax. Money coming for uncle Sam, right when questions about paying for stimulus.... Personally I think it adds up, but that's for you to decide. 

Okay so that's the hype...

Let's talk about the tickers listed ($SNDL and $TLRY). 

$SNDL

I'll start with the cheaper YOLO, $SNDL. $SNDL short interest isn't high, but the company did issue convertible notes a while back around .7c if my memory is correct. I'm not saying they won't do it again, but they should be in a good place fiscally for now. Float is high with about 1.6B shares out there. However today's volume at the time of writing is over 415M. That's not bad given such a high float. It's about 200% more than the average volume. 

The options chain on $SNDL has me giddy. With over 200,000 options currently in the money on todays move above $1 there is some high potential here for some interesting action. The put to call ratio is just obnoxiously low at .08 it's screaming upwards betting. If we hold above $1 the potential squeeze up could be amazing.   


It's also broken up on the trend lines and out of the downward channel it was in. The regression channel from the peak squeeze back in Feb just broke out today according to my crayons I have laying around. 

$TLRY

$TLRY was the squeeze of a lifetime if you remember it back in 19'. The ticker was just a money printer with it's low float and stupid hype. Then they proceeded to do, like they all do, and issue debt. Shares tumbled since then falling from $120 --> $5. Ouch bag holders.   


Like all the cannabis stocks the Feb bump pushed $TLRY to above $60 in an amazing move. $TLRY has a lower short interest than $SNDL, but it also has a much lower float at about 300M. Compared to $SNDL the volume here isn't as good, but still remains decently above the avg volume around 36M as of right now. 

If we peep the options chain we also see a crazy low P/C ratio around .11. But we don't have the Open Interest in the chain like $SNDL does unless you roll out to Jun 18. Then we finally get some decent OI.   


Personally I am going with $SNDL. The option's chain looks better, the stock is cheaper, and the short interest is a little better. My advice would be to roll out till at least the Jun 11th $1 strike to not get eaten alive by Theta and IV crush. But WSB does what WSB wants and that's why I love you all.   
Do not go above the $2 strikes IMO. You will get crushed by theta unless we get an insane move, which could happen but I don't see the risk / reward there.",nn326f,MORE ACT / CANNABIS / $SNDL & $TLRY Potential

>A corner in the silver market has been tried before - and let's be clear, that is what is being attempted now.  In 1980, a rule change by the government destroyed the corner.  #silverthursday.

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday

>Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers‚Äô attempt to corner the market on the metal.

-
>Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926‚Äì2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers‚Äô Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.

-
>By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged‚ÄîMarch 27‚Äîsilver fell to $10.80, the metal‚Äôs biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, ‚ÄúA billion dollars isn‚Äôt what it used to be,‚Äù the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.

-
>To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978‚Äì91) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities.",nn36fw,There is no silver short squeeze happening.

* Henrik Fisker is a God among men in the automotive industry - trust him to do right
* Geeta Gupta-Fisker is a solid Chief Financial Officer with experience in investment banking - she will ensure the shares are valued right
* Henrik has learned from all the mistakes he made with his previous attempt to create Fisker Automotive, and will certainly do everything in his power to avoid that mess again. He has designed systems into the intricacies of the company to avoid failure - meaning Fisker Inc is guaranteed to succeed
* Henrik Fisker on shorting $FSR - ‚ÄúYou will quickly understand that you stand to lose a lot of money if you show it against Fisker‚Äù
* Production of Fisker Ocean expected to start in November 2022
* 250,000+ units a year expected by 2025
* Partnerships with Foxconn and Magna Steyr, both giants in their respective industries, among others
* Large Fleet market in Europe gaining momentum, and 700+ Fisker reservations in this market alone
* 16,000+ reservations already. More than Tesla had 18 months pre-production
* Revenue streams include leasing automotives, servicing, selling emissions credits, selling insurance (like selling the pickaxe to miners, and selling the diamonds to the mine owners too, absolutely genius - Fisker are insuring cars which they own, because the customer is only leasing it)
* High short interest (20%+), high analyst price targets compared to current share price (100%+) and low valuation compared to peers ($3bn market cap currently)
* Designing the first ever all-electric popemobile - Massive, soon to be historic, event!
* I give $FSR (currently $13 a share) a price target of $100 by end of year 2022, if not sooner
* Price Targets: $35 by end of year - Previous ATH. $50 start of next year - European and Chinese debut of prototypes. $100 end of 2022 - start of production (SOP). $150+ 2023
* 2025 Price Targets, calculated using projected data: Bear case - $97 a share, Bull case - $519 a share
* Downside in the short term is capped by the large amount of cash on hand - one third of market cap is cash. Long term, is capped by risk factors, which are almost eligible and affect every automotive startup anyway.

Fisker stated in 2018 that, with the growth of car-sharing, ride-hailing, and autonomous shuttles, he believes within 10 years private cars will be used for less than half of what they are currently used for.

## Fisker Automotive

In 2008, Fisker Automotive raised over $90 million from investors including venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. In September 2009, Fisker Automotive was awarded a $528 million loan guarantee by the United States Department of Energy (DOE). The automaker was one of four recipients of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, to encourage the domestic manufacture of electric cars. The funds were to be used to develop the Karma, as well as an affordable family-size plug-in hybrid car. The loan facility was frozen at $192 million in February 2012, after the DOE claimed that Fisker missed its milestones

In December 2011, just as the Fisker Karma was launched, its battery supplier, A123 Systems, recalled all batteries, followed by a second recall in 2012. A123 filed for bankruptcy in October 2012, leaving Fisker Automotive without a battery supplier. After selling approximately 2,000 units, production of the Fisker Karma was suspended in November 2012, in the absence of its battery supplier.

Henrik Fisker resigned as chairman from Fisker Automotive in March 2013, because of disagreements with management about business strategy. Later that year, the company declared voluntary bankruptcy.Fisker raised and spent more than a billion dollars over its lifetime.The heart of Fisker‚Äôs business model was in that early deal with Quantum. The idea was to design a gorgeous car, and have suppliers like Quantum provide the technology because off-the-shelf parts from suppliers would help keep costs down.

But there were problems with this strategy: Sometimes, those parts had to be custom-made to fit the design vision, which resulted in higher prices for Fisker. Other times, parts were delivered late or, worse, faulty, but Fisker was locked in to those supplier relationships. Sources close to Fisker have also said that many of the parts were owned by the suppliers themselves, so Fisker didn‚Äôt own a lot of the internal technology.

The broker that raised funds for Fisker automotive, by selling their private shares, was Advanced Equities.It wasn‚Äôt until December 2011 and into 2012 that the more dubious efforts of Advanced Equities became clearer to Fisker‚Äôs hundreds of investors. The last few hundred million dollars of Advanced Equities‚Äô fund raising for Fisker, starting with the D-1 round, was what brokers call ‚Äúpay to play.‚Äù As Fisker was running into technical, delivery and political problems, its valuation was quickly declining. But the company still needed more money, so the brokers went back to its current investors and said: Unless you give this more, your current shares will be diluted and your preferred stock will be converted to common stock.

It was essentially a gun to their heads. This is why investor Wray sued Fisker in February 2012, alleging he was on the receiving end of this tactic. In his lawsuit, he says Advanced Equities sent him a letter dated Jan. 18, 2012, stating that he needed to decide if he wanted to invest in Fisker‚Äôs next round, and pay around $84,000 by Jan. 27, 2012 ‚Äî a little over a week from receiving the letter. He also says that Advanced Equities assured him that he would have anti-dilution protection. According to the audio clip from Advanced Equities‚Äô internal sales call in early 2010, Advanced Equity leaders say that the Fisker deal will ‚Äúsuffer no dilution,‚Äù and was ‚Äúa dream scenario.‚Äù

That dream would soon end. In September 2012 after Fisker closed on $1.2 billion in funding, the bulk of it organized by Advanced Equities, the SEC charged the broker with misleading investors when it raised money for another company back in 2009 and 2010 (Bloom Energy). Advanced settled, agreeing to pay $1 million, and its co-founders were personally fined. Two months later Advanced Equities closed up shop.

Later, A123 Systems itself went bankrupt, causing more problems for Fisker. Fisker claimed that A123 Systems owed it $140 million, but a bankruptcy settlement reduced that to a paltry $15 million.

Then there was the just plain terrible luck for the ironically named Karma: Super Storm Sandy wiped out 338 of its Karmas in storage in New Jersey. The cars first drowned, and then caught on fire ‚Äî salt water damage caused a short circuit that was spread to other cars by high winds, Fisker said at the time.

With all of this happening in public ‚Äî and in a presidential election year ‚Äî Fisker‚Äôs struggles became highly politicized. The company was mentioned numerous times in presidential debates and speeches leading up to the election. Republican nominee Romney called Fisker and other DOE-supported companies losers.

The company didn‚Äôt seem to invest substantially in technology innovation or tech IP, and seemed to spend a disproportionate amount on suppliers. For example, numerous sources have said that the company paid upfront for 15,000 of some of the parts for its planned 15,000 Karmas. It ended up only selling around 2,000 of the cars. It has also been said that Fisker paid some funds upfront to have BMW make engines for the 100,000 Nina cars it hoped to produce ‚Äî in the end, Fisker didn‚Äôt deliver a single Nina.

Costs to build each Karma also creeped up because the company missed its volume targets, and because engineering had to change designs around supplier constraints. The company ended up adding $20,000 to its initial sale price.

Expensive hires may also have sucked away chunks of Fisker‚Äôs funding: Sources say that Fisker filled the upper levels of the company with seasoned auto executives from Detroit. At the high point of Fisker, the company had around 300 employees, plus dozens of contract staff. Bringing in a certain amount of the old guard could help a car startup ramp up quickly, and also impress potential investors with ‚Äúindustry names.‚Äù But those people are also used to big auto-industry budgets that included extensive travel and salaries ‚Äî that‚Äôs the opposite life of a tech startup.

## Fisker Inc.

In July 2016, Henrik Fisker expressed interest in designing a fully connected electric car with autonomous driving features and an aesthetically pleasing look. He has pursued battery technology, and hinted at potentially reviving the Fisker name with a pure-electric vehicle using technology that nobody else has. Since then Fisker has talked about delays to the promised solid state battery technology, which he does not expect to be able to be produced in volume until at least 2025. Posing risk for competition from more scientifically experienced future solid state battery producers such as Quantumscape.

***Forbes:*** ‚ÄúNow he‚Äôs back‚Äìand three things are different. First and foremost, he has a vital new partner: his wife, cofounder and Fisker Inc. CFO Geeta Gupta-Fisker. Second, his Los Angeles-based company is public this time around, raising more than $1 billion in an October 2020 IPO. And finally, Fisker‚Äôs stock price, up 56% since its debut, has made both Henrik and Geeta billionaires, each worth about $1.1 billion as of Friday‚Äôs market close. The auto industry has seen father-son and sibling leadership teams, but Fisker Inc.‚Äôs CEO-CFO combo is the fast-changing sector‚Äôs first husband and wife power couple.‚Äù

Wealth isn‚Äôt the purpose of the new company, Henrik says. ‚ÄúI never got into cars because of money. (This shows he is willing to do what is in the best interest of the company because he is not motivated by money, unlike 99% of other CEO‚Äôs)

The couple sought a big stake in the new venture to ensure they can control its fate in a way Fisker couldn‚Äôt with his earlier company.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yzhded6pfw171.png?width=408&format=png&auto=webp&s=54b30259720cf853a8efeacf058f2f74315260b9

Henrik is an auto industry celebrity, but Geeta‚Äôs background is equally impressive. A native of India, she holds multiple degrees in science, including a Ph.D. in biotechnology from Cambridge University where she was also a Research Newton Fellow. From there, she started a career in international investment for Lloyds Banking Group, and then managed investments for a high-net-worth client for several years. (In particular, this is insanely important - Geeta **KNOWS MONEY**! She knows how best to keep a company afloat, organize its share structure, provide value to shareholders, etc. because she has worked in the industry before. She may just be the most important element of Fisker Inc., due to the financial experience she has. At every step of the way, she is likely to make decisions with one sole focus - increasing share price and value).

She met her future husband in 2011 when he was visiting London, just before things started going very wrong at Fisker Automotive. They married in 2012.

‚ÄúWhen I left Fisker Automotive, all I had was my car,‚Äù Henrik remembers. ‚ÄúI'm in a different position, mainly because of Geeta. Because she cuts the deals.‚Äù

To get the new venture off the ground, the Fiskers invested the majority of their life savings‚Äìan enormous financial risk given the fate of Henrik‚Äôs prior company. Then, just as they were locking in plans for the IPO back in July, they were hit by a highly unwelcome complication: Geeta learned she had early-stage breast cancer.

‚ÄúShe got the call (from her doctor) during a call with investors,‚Äù Henrik says. Despite that bombshell, she continued working with banks and investors in the weeks that followed, even as she underwent two surgical procedures and radiation therapy. Her medical therapy concluded in November.

Henrik, who marvels at her fortitude throughout the health crisis says, ‚Äúshe only missed something like one day of work...That's just how she is. She works tirelessly.‚Äù

## Fisker Ocean

The Fisker Ocean will have a nearly 300-mile range with an 80 kWh battery and a solar panel roof as a range extender, adding approximately 1,000 free miles of range per year. Advanced electronics will be housed under the hood, and the vehicle will incorporate recycled and sustainable materials throughout. Deliveries of the Ocean are scheduled to begin in 2022.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s87j6bdsfw171.png?width=438&format=png&auto=webp&s=e40add9ce53319d31db242cce73a303afb03cbab

Fisker has also announced a partnership with Electrify America to ensure Fisker Ocean vehicles will integrate seamlessly with Electrify America charging stations when the e-SUV hits the market. With features such as a solar roof and recycled inner materials, it will be, according to Fisker Inc., the ""world's most sustainable vehicle.""

In 2017, Fisker Inc. announced that it had filed patents on flexible solid-state battery designs. Fisker expected the batteries to be produced on a mass scale around 2020. A prototype of the battery debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018. In October 2018, Fisker announced new funding for battery development through Caterpillar Venture Capital. The solid-state batteries are intended to deliver longer vehicle range and faster charging times.

In 2018, Fisker was named to the board of directors of First Cobalt, a North American cobalt refinery that produces battery materials.

In September 2019, it was announced that Fisker Inc. was partnering with Game of Thrones actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who will serve as a partner and sustainability adviser to Fisker, to work on advanced, affordable, electric mobility models.

&#x200B;

[In addition to being a well-known actor, Coster-Waldau is also the United Nations Development Program Goodwill Ambassador for climate change and other social issues.](https://preview.redd.it/3hssff5vfw171.png?width=451&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebe55e2468c5b63d1bc0ac3c71547219dff5afaa)

Nikolaj wrote this piece about Fisker:

To quote a friend of mine who is a lot smarter than me, architect Bjarke Ingels: ‚ÄúThe idea that sustainability needs to sacrifice quality of life is a flawed one. It‚Äôs a design challenge, a challenge to build something that transforms the idea of sustainability into something that will increase the quality of life for all those around it.‚Äù

One person meeting that challenge is Henrik Fisker, who has designed some of the most iconic cars over the past decades for BMW and others, like the BMW Z8, Aston Martin DB9 and Aston Martin V8 Vantage. He‚Äôs a hero for gas-guzzling supercars. He is a fellow Dane, I am a fan, and we met, of all places, on Twitter.

When we met in person, he described his new project ‚Äî an all-electric luxury SUV ‚Äî and asked me if I would help spread the word on his car. The problem as I see it with most electric cars is that they only accomplish the basics. They get you from point A to B. They run electric so you don‚Äôt pollute while driving, but that‚Äôs it. They are basically unattractive combustion engine cars that have a battery thrown into them ‚Äî and for most of them, a battery with a limited range. What Fisker does is to try to make every part of the car in a sustainable and attractive way, like a full-length solar roof, recycled floor mats and vegan leather seats. It looks incredibly cool and inviting, with a great 250- to 300-mile range, and at a cost of just under $40,000, it‚Äôs a luxury car affordable to a mass market.

I said yes and even became an investor, not only because it‚Äôs a great car but more importantly, I hope and believe it can inspire other companies to actively incorporate sustainability goals into all aspects of their business. Fisker then had the idea of calling me ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù adviser. Which I am not. Just to be clear. Thanks Henrik, sounds cool, but I am an actor and a citizen, and that‚Äôs really it.

And what about Hollywood? Is our industry changing, are we at the forefront? Looking at social media, you would think so. And things are happening, but usually only when a camera is pointed at people. Remember a few years back when all awards shows only used EVs for the red carpet? We made a difference. We mattered. We showed the way. So cool. So green, so ‚Ä¶ brief. Now it‚Äôs back to the Escalade. But hey, we are not using plastic straws anymore!

To believe that change will come from Hollywood is not really based in reality (when did that stop us?), but we are great at reacting ‚Äî and things around us are changing, and changing us. I have a good friend who loves his SUV. It‚Äôs not electric. But he cannot give up his car. He is a good guy, he‚Äôs works for the U.N., so if he has a problem going electric, we all do. But if he is presented with an alternative that doesn‚Äôt mean a reduction in his quality of life, something like the Fisker SUV, I think he‚Äôd transition to electric in a heartbeat.

The IPO deal values Fisker Inc at US$2.9 billion, with an IPO share price of $10.

On July 30, 2020, Fisker announced plans for a four-vehicle portfolio by 2025. The Fisker Ocean SUV will be joined by a sports sedan based on their previously announced Fisker Emotion concept, a coupe-like SUV, and a lifestyle pickup truck. All will be electric vehicles.

On October 15, 2020, Fisker Inc announced it would be outsourcing vehicle production of its Fisker Ocean electric SUV to Magna Steyr, to reduce the complexities and costs related to the building and operating its own factory. Magna will start building the Fisker Ocean in Europe in 2022.

## Henrik Fisker Interview quotes:

I have people on Twitter saying, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just make the car next month? You have a prototype.‚Äù Most people don‚Äôt understand that it takes 18 months to do long-lead body tooling for high-volume vehicles. Most people don‚Äôt understand it takes two years to do durability tests and do all the engineering certification and everything else.

And on the business model itself, I believe that there is nobody in the near future or the next couple of years that‚Äôs going to make a million EVs on one model. Today, there‚Äôs nobody doing it. Tesla probably has the highest volume of one single model, a couple hundred thousand. But even the big giant established carmakers are not making, right now, a couple hundred thousand vehicles of one model. So the way you get volume, in my view, is if you partner up with other OEMs and share some of the expensive parts of the platform, which in my view is not anymore something that is unique IP or something that is a unique experience to the customer. An aluminum stamped floor or a steel stamped floor really doesn‚Äôt have any brand value anymore.

And obviously, as we move forward, we always start to do some of the things ourselves. But it was really about de-risking in our first vehicle to market. So we‚Äôre going to do another three vehicles, which we can do because we don‚Äôt have to spend all our money and effort on learning how to manufacture a car, for instance.

So we have programmed a lot. We have hired a head of ESG, environmental and social governance, and he is really spearheading developing specific... we kind of put out some goals that we would like to reach with suppliers, and we at least try to bring them in that direction. They are not reaching those goals right now, but they may reach them later. And then we have goals for ourselves. So for instance, we look at transport. Are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs closer to the plant, or are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs on the other side of the planet that way we have to then transport all that stuff. So those are the types of things that we‚Äôre really thinking about now as we‚Äôre nominating suppliers. And finally, materials as well, looking at sustainable materials. We‚Äôve actually picked up a lot of knowledge on that side as well, where we are adding more sustainable materials to our vehicle. So we are actually looking across everything ‚Äî supply chain, where the suppliers are located, what the suppliers are doing for sustainability, and also then of course in the vehicle itself ‚Äî in terms of the type of materials there.

https://preview.redd.it/nb8ozukrpw171.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd5a515f831dedcc57b25d717c5c133c0c74299d

So - let's summarize - prices are rising at their fastest pace in almost 30 years and incomes just plunged by their most ever! We're gonna need more stimmies!""  

Plus  to above; 

Last year, Hirschman Capital noted that since 1821, 98% of sovereigns that hit 130% debt/GDP have defaulted on their sovereign debt.   

The US hit 130% late last year. 

Simple Conclussion : The Fed can‚Äôt go ‚Äúhawkish‚Äù and raise rates without sending markets ‚Äìand economies‚Äìto their knees; by extension, they now have nothing left to ‚Äúcut‚Äù when the current everything bubble implodes.

And that  is a *real problem*.

 There are only two ways for sovereigns to default: 

Inflation or collapse.    

The latter is not an option. 

 As for a solution, what‚Äôs so tragic is that the only option before the Fed is an even bigger problem‚Äîcurrent and inevitably more inflation. 

 That is, if the Fed wants to keep markets (and their job security) breathing, they no longer have the foregoing template of ‚Äúrate-hike-followed-by-rate-cutting‚Äù at their disposal, which means they now have no choice but to dovishly keep rates near the zero-bound indefinitely.

But the only way to keep rates ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù and nailed to the floor of time is to purchase otherwise unwanted bonds to keep their prices elevated and hence yields and rates repressed.

Such bond ‚Äúaccommodation,‚Äù of course, costs money, and as we already know, the only ‚Äúmoney‚Äù the Fed has to spend is the kind they create out of thin air‚Äì the very kind of money (and policy) which leads to the kind of inflation discussed above‚Äînamely, the brutal kind.

 As for that fake money, the evidence of the Fed‚Äôs desperate (and only) direction is now obvious, as the following M2 money supply makes equally clear. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v774ta55sw171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e73c839beb67a67eea9aed7de4ac61d86813840

 

Fed is so embarrassed by this ‚Äúprinting solution‚Äù that they‚Äôve stopped *weekly* reporting of M2 data, and frankly, since March, have even stopped *monthly* reporting of the same.

That, of course, is both telling as well as disgraceful‚Ä¶ The Fed literally has something to hide, and that never bodes well, does it?

&#x200B;

 The correlation to central bank balance sheet (i.e., money supply) expansion and rising markets is now beyond dispute. 

&#x200B;

 In short‚Äîdo you see the correlation and pattern? Do you see how the Fed‚Äôs market sausage is made? More importantly, do you now see the Fed‚Äôs self-made conundrum? 

 

Given that the Fed bows to the markets not the people, which choice do you think they‚Äôll make?

In other words, expect more money printing and more yield curve control‚Äîand hence more money creation, more inflation, and by extension more fiat currency debasement.

 More money supply to keep rates monetized simply means more currency debasement and rising inflation.",nn51ou,"""Fed's ""Favorite"" #Inflation Indicator (PCE) Explodes At Fastest Rate Since 1992 As Incomes Crash By Record"""

6901,,2021-05-28 20:45:08,t3_nn76we,,wallstreetbets,"TLDR:

I have leading indicators telling me that there are two concurrent shifts underway when it comes to who is purchasing homes.

\- Massive increase in unmarried people buying houses alone. This used to be somewhat unusual, now it's becoming very common.

\- Massive increase in unmarried men, in particular, buying houses alone. Traditionally, the female-to-male ratio of unmarried homebuyers was about 5 to 1. For the last 3 months, it's been closer to 50/50.

Source is my own closed real estate purchase transactions. Am a mortgage broker (btw this means cash purchases are ""invisible"" to me). It takes 3-6 months for [HMDA data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Mortgage_Disclosure_Act) to become accessible to journalists and academics, and thus ""visible"" to the general public (assuming journalists deem it worthy of commenting on), but I can see the trends live in real time.

How would one go about placing a bet that in about 3 or 6 months, the media, journalists, academics, etc, will pick up on this, publish articles, and potentially cause a lot of people to buy certain stocks. Which stocks would that be? Is there a ""Mancave, Inc"" out there that would potentially get an uptick? Or maybe a company making smart-home stuff that is particularly suited to renting by the room (the single men are not buying 1 bedroom condos, they are buying proper houses with 3 bedrooms, etc)?

EDIT: oh, and to be clear. It's not just an uptick in single men. It's an uptick in women too, but a massive surge from the men. It used to be that for 15 banana sales, 10 are to married couples, 4 to single women, and 1 to a single man. Now for the same 15 banana sales, it's 6 to married couples, 6 to single women, and 3 to single men, something like that.",nn76we,Homebuyer Demographics Shift towards single and male. How to bet?

I have been doing research and talking to as many people I can that have some sort of experience/knowledge when dealing with the stock market. I heard about the potential to get into AMC and make some serious profit. I invested early on when shares were selling for around $8.00. I kept reading we need to hold until June 2nd and reevaluate. That‚Äôs my current plan, but hey I don‚Äôt know much about the game lol.

My current understanding of why there is a squeeze is because of previous events which backed hedge funds into a corner. Basically the hedge funds have had to borrow shares to pay off debt to companies like GME. When borrowing those shares, hedge fund companies left themselves vulnerable because they have no more money to borrow to pay off their debt. So if everyone buys stock in AMC and holds it, then the hedge fund companies are forced to pay out. The more people that buy and hold their shares then the higher the shares are worth and over time it will pay a profit. 

Like I said, I‚Äôm new to the game and this is just my current understanding of how the masses can manipulate the stock market. Please comment and enlighten me on another view point or correct my understanding. Let‚Äôs all get rich and work together with the power of knowledge!

It was on a Thursday night 02/25/2021 when I posted, at the time RKT was around 19-20 range and on the following Monday 03/01/2021 it started rallying, by 03/02 & 03/03 it hit the ATH level 43. You‚Äôre welcome to find my last DD post for verification. And for those of you who made tendies on it congratulations to you all! Spread the good energy!

As I am writing this post Today is 05/28/2021, I‚Äôll try to bring more data and technical analysis on $RKT, as you all saw what happened yesterday 05/27/2021 around lunch time upon sudden move it went from 17.50 area all the way to 19.40. This move doesn‚Äôt seem so random at all, a combination of someone noticed this to be a strategic technical squeeze just testing the water after it being suppressed down for the past 3 months, and you can see how fast the shorts started covering all of a sudden.

Today 05/28/2021, at opening it shot up to $19.20 but the shorts came prepared for $RKT this morning with their analysts and news blasting numerous articles and downgrades from Morgan Stanley, Wedbush & Zacks, ALL AT ONCE. This is certainly no coincidence.

On the technical side, on the daily chart as you can see it has a gap to fill around 22.67 area then it‚Äôll go straight to 28 and has a huge potential to pass beyond that and make it to a new all-time high, there‚Äôs nothing stopping it. On the daily MACD closed red and turned green, RSI is at the same level as last time before it squeezed to ATH $43, Parabolic S.A.R indicator flipped from red on the daily to green for the first time in 3 months. Another important factor is as you look at the volume and candle compared to last time it exploded (both red arrows) same volume, same price action.

Conclusion: the shorts are basically scared sh\*tless right now and they know it, is a tickle to the trigger for it to explode again like last time or even higher. Based on Excess Returns Model the fair value for RKT is $85, so why haven't we seen $100 yet?

Everyone is talking about how the squeeze didn't even happen and the shorts didn't cover yet. What I don't understand is why wouldn't that be possible? If short interest is 17%, so let's round up to about 100M shares. Today the volume traded was 700M shares. Couldn't 100M of those 700M have been the shorts covering? And if they didn't cover, today alone 700M shares were traded, why would 100M shares bought by shorts cause a squeeze if today 700M were traded?

I have been having this question for awhile, since I noticed the same with GME. In the days preceding January 28th (when GME reached its peak), the combined volume was several times the amount of float. How come the squeeze happened and why did it happen? If the volume was so high, couldn't the shorts have covered in the days preceding that?

I hope this makes sense and I really hope someone will be kind enough to explain a fellow retard who only knows about crayons what this all means.

Everything looked to have gone off successfully. We are now waiting on the data and craft to be analysed and inspected. This will take a few weeks according to Michael Colglazier.
That being said he had already outlined the test schedule in the earnings zoom call.

1st test flight - may 
2nd crewed flight - June 
3rd flight with R Branson on board late June/July 

4th flight this will be taking the Italian airforce on a training mission (600k a seat) late July


On the run in to the first test flight some possible maintenance issues appeared with the carrier plane White knight 2‚Ä¶. 
This indeed could have gone either way , after 2 weeks inspections it was decided that WK2 did not need to delay testing no maintenance was needed at this point. Scheduled Maintenance will commence in the fall after all tests have been completed.
Upon this news it is my opinion that the testing programme will go ahead as planned.

The market has responded accordingly and the stock is now up from $17-‚Ç¨31

With all these catalysts lined up before the end of the year and commercial operations looming for early 2022 things are looking up for Virgin Galactic.The success of the last test flight the company have now proven tech and concept. 
Also with revenue now coming in Nasa who are conducting micro gravity analysis.
Also international training for military pilots and astronauts.

I had a look at $BB and assume that we finally formed the bottom. In the last few days we saw a sharp rise which might continue in the next weeks. If we can break the 12$ resistance, the next targets would be aroung 25-28$. 

Using Elliot wave theory we are probably at the end of the correction wave 4 and now began with the bullish wave 5.

Price targets:

\#2 25$

Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed.

In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales.  Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%.

I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time  for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

This is my first time making a post here, please do give constructive feedback and criticism.

7163,,2021-05-28 10:41:01,t3_nmuzzi,,wallstreetbets,"Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent of Modernas if not more. Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects) 

Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

Imagine if the spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize one piece to understand the whole picture it and helps modify your DNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates it can still recognize the virus. In contrast to using one portion of the picture as it mutates it's easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine, that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. Not only that but they have had the least amount of side effects of any covid vaccine deeming it the safest covid vaccine.... 

And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein (whole picture) and the safety profile. Also worth a mention is that you could store it in a regular refrigerator, and let it sit out in room temperature while you're vaccinating people instead of a special ultra low temp freeze needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers, this is a majority of the world. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines so other protein competitors will be far behind and they will have an a moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing they teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine. They will be combining flu and covid vaccine by 2025 for possibly double the price of current covid vaccine.

 They are pretty much de-risked at this point. Yes you could buy other  biotechs that can go up 20x but are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up) that has all successful trials done so far, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment to where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place there are no more glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""

They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. Yesterday at market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. 
 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

Future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract in there ( in the link below in another message). It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 

As far as my position I own some $200 July calls along with about 933 shares. I'm all in baby.  Been in since $4.06, I panicked and sold once during February a couple months during the mini bear market we had and got back in a bit too early so got a wash sale üôà but I'm diamond hands all the way to $800 from here.  LFG I expect to turn that into a cool million in a year's time via shares and options based on the DD provided. Just know this isn't all completely my DD some of this is taken from my good friends at the community Nvax community on Stocktwits. They're one of the most hardcore groups that provides excellent DD and are always willing to help each other a hand if anyone's got questions highly recommend to check it out. So my point is this is information collected over the months that is a group consensus on nvax future price. (Check out next link below this paragraph, it has My positions and an amazing DD chart converting contracts to future price and comparing with competitors. My screen name on stovktwits  is the same on there Johnnyknowsbest. Been on there and here since i started with nvax.

Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. This is huge as the combo is going to differentiate them especially since both flu and covid vaccines are first in class.

Gamma Index: decreased to -0.1 (A large negative figure indicates volatility may be high. The range is from 4 to ‚Äì4.)

Vol Trigger: Increased to 419 (Important support and resistance level. (above this level = lower volatility and a more stable stock price.)

Abs Gamma Strike: Unchanged

Gamma Notional: Decreased to $-516 (stock has larger put gamma position. A negative gamma position implies higher volatility in the underlying)

Put Wall Support: Increased to 419 (If Put Wall shifts to a higher strike it could be a bearish indication)

Call Wall Strike: Increased to 425 (When this strike is rolled higher it is generally considered bullish)

Gamma Tilt: Decreased to 0.88	 (when decreasing it‚Äôs a bearish signal.)

Net Delta: Increased to 198k (positive delta position infers options market makers have a net long hedge.)

25d risk reversal: Increased to -0.06 (When the ratio shifts towards 0 it indicates call demand)

""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior.""
2) Being that we do not have access to a 10-K filing for Q4 fiscal '19, we will access other filings that do in fact reference numbers from fiscal '19...
A) 10-K filing dated 9/11/2020
B) 10-Q filing dated 5/6/2020
3) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $223.3M under Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19)
But, that is TOTAL Revenue; we need to find out what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike sales...
4) To calculate what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike Sales, we can use numbers from neighboring Q3 (i.e. Three Months Ended March 31, 2019)...
A) On page 6 of the 10-Q, you will find Revenue of ""Connected Fitness Products"" (aka Bike Sales) to be $261.6M
B) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $316.7M
C) % of Bike Sales per TOTAL Revenue: $261.6M / $316.7M * 100 = 82.6% {""Connected Fitness Products"" Revenue (aka Bike Sales)}
5) Apply 82.6% to the TOTAL Revenue $223.3M for Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19): $223.3M x 0.826 = $184.45M {Bike Sales for Q4 of fiscal '19}
6) Per the CFO, ""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior."":

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote... By mid-July, we‚Äôll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase precious metals  especially silver amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative 

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

Gold rose over 60% in the 1930s as the prices of stocks and real estate crashed. You could buy an entire block with a one ounce gold coin. Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms.

I must address Cramer's statement because he is obviously trying to add fuel to the short-selling fire: When he says ""we're not going natural gas"" he is clearly making a vague and general statement meant to be interpreted in the worst possible way: ""no one is going to buy or use natural gas."" By now, I hope everyone that is interested in this stock understands that CLNE offers an alternative transportation fuel, thus, the investments made by BP and Chevron, and not revolutionary technology like some EV's (but this is mostly hype meant to catapult EVs to the front. What most people do not realize is that driverless technology and such can be placed in Petro vehicles too). Also, unfortunately, the company has done a terrible marketting job. That's why powerful analysts can get away with making vague and unsupported statements. The fact that Cramer explained the stock's decrease over the last month as being due to widespread dissaproval is misleading, at best. Many people do not yet know about the cleanliness and therapeutic effects RNG has on the climate.

The News...

If you haven't read yet it looks like Federal Cannabis legalization my be around the corner. [Here](https://www.mpp.org/policy/federal/the-more-act/) is the House Bill. Supporters seem on board and like the reforms they have done to the bill including rescheduling cannabis. [Last time](https://mjbizdaily.com/key-us-house-lawmaker-reintroduces-federal-marijuana-legalization-bill/) the bill was introduced it cleared the House.   


Personally I think this gets a lot of support especially from a fiscal point of view. With stimulus stalling and a giant debate going on about how to pay for the stimulus I think cannabis offers the easiest way to collect federal revenue. A simple review of the bill and the fiscal benefits to the Fed's can be read [here](https://www.justtherealnews.com/congress/nadler-blumenauer-lee-jackson-lee-jeffries-velazquez-reintroduce-comprehensive-marijuana-reform-legislation/). The bill states a 5% fed tax. Money coming for uncle Sam, right when questions about paying for stimulus.... Personally I think it adds up, but that's for you to decide. 

Okay so that's the hype...

Let's talk about the tickers listed ($SNDL and $TLRY). 

$SNDL

I'll start with the cheaper YOLO, $SNDL. $SNDL short interest isn't high, but the company did issue convertible notes a while back around .7c if my memory is correct. I'm not saying they won't do it again, but they should be in a good place fiscally for now. Float is high with about 1.6B shares out there. However today's volume at the time of writing is over 415M. That's not bad given such a high float. It's about 200% more than the average volume. 

The options chain on $SNDL has me giddy. With over 200,000 options currently in the money on todays move above $1 there is some high potential here for some interesting action. The put to call ratio is just obnoxiously low at .08 it's screaming upwards betting. If we hold above $1 the potential squeeze up could be amazing.   


It's also broken up on the trend lines and out of the downward channel it was in. The regression channel from the peak squeeze back in Feb just broke out today according to my crayons I have laying around. 

$TLRY

$TLRY was the squeeze of a lifetime if you remember it back in 19'. The ticker was just a money printer with it's low float and stupid hype. Then they proceeded to do, like they all do, and issue debt. Shares tumbled since then falling from $120 --> $5. Ouch bag holders.   


Like all the cannabis stocks the Feb bump pushed $TLRY to above $60 in an amazing move. $TLRY has a lower short interest than $SNDL, but it also has a much lower float at about 300M. Compared to $SNDL the volume here isn't as good, but still remains decently above the avg volume around 36M as of right now. 

If we peep the options chain we also see a crazy low P/C ratio around .11. But we don't have the Open Interest in the chain like $SNDL does unless you roll out to Jun 18. Then we finally get some decent OI.   


Personally I am going with $SNDL. The option's chain looks better, the stock is cheaper, and the short interest is a little better. My advice would be to roll out till at least the Jun 11th $1 strike to not get eaten alive by Theta and IV crush. But WSB does what WSB wants and that's why I love you all.   
Do not go above the $2 strikes IMO. You will get crushed by theta unless we get an insane move, which could happen but I don't see the risk / reward there.",nn326f,MORE ACT / CANNABIS / $SNDL & $TLRY Potential

>A corner in the silver market has been tried before - and let's be clear, that is what is being attempted now.  In 1980, a rule change by the government destroyed the corner.  #silverthursday.

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday

>Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers‚Äô attempt to corner the market on the metal.

-
>Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926‚Äì2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers‚Äô Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.

-
>By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged‚ÄîMarch 27‚Äîsilver fell to $10.80, the metal‚Äôs biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, ‚ÄúA billion dollars isn‚Äôt what it used to be,‚Äù the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.

-
>To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978‚Äì91) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities.",nn36fw,There is no silver short squeeze happening.

* Henrik Fisker is a God among men in the automotive industry - trust him to do right
* Geeta Gupta-Fisker is a solid Chief Financial Officer with experience in investment banking - she will ensure the shares are valued right
* Henrik has learned from all the mistakes he made with his previous attempt to create Fisker Automotive, and will certainly do everything in his power to avoid that mess again. He has designed systems into the intricacies of the company to avoid failure - meaning Fisker Inc is guaranteed to succeed
* Henrik Fisker on shorting $FSR - ‚ÄúYou will quickly understand that you stand to lose a lot of money if you show it against Fisker‚Äù
* Production of Fisker Ocean expected to start in November 2022
* 250,000+ units a year expected by 2025
* Partnerships with Foxconn and Magna Steyr, both giants in their respective industries, among others
* Large Fleet market in Europe gaining momentum, and 700+ Fisker reservations in this market alone
* 16,000+ reservations already. More than Tesla had 18 months pre-production
* Revenue streams include leasing automotives, servicing, selling emissions credits, selling insurance (like selling the pickaxe to miners, and selling the diamonds to the mine owners too, absolutely genius - Fisker are insuring cars which they own, because the customer is only leasing it)
* High short interest (20%+), high analyst price targets compared to current share price (100%+) and low valuation compared to peers ($3bn market cap currently)
* Designing the first ever all-electric popemobile - Massive, soon to be historic, event!
* I give $FSR (currently $13 a share) a price target of $100 by end of year 2022, if not sooner
* Price Targets: $35 by end of year - Previous ATH. $50 start of next year - European and Chinese debut of prototypes. $100 end of 2022 - start of production (SOP). $150+ 2023
* 2025 Price Targets, calculated using projected data: Bear case - $97 a share, Bull case - $519 a share
* Downside in the short term is capped by the large amount of cash on hand - one third of market cap is cash. Long term, is capped by risk factors, which are almost eligible and affect every automotive startup anyway.

## Fisker Automotive

In 2008, Fisker Automotive raised over $90 million from investors including venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. In September 2009, Fisker Automotive was awarded a $528 million loan guarantee by the United States Department of Energy (DOE). The automaker was one of four recipients of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, to encourage the domestic manufacture of electric cars. The funds were to be used to develop the Karma, as well as an affordable family-size plug-in hybrid car. The loan facility was frozen at $192 million in February 2012, after the DOE claimed that Fisker missed its milestones

In December 2011, just as the Fisker Karma was launched, its battery supplier, A123 Systems, recalled all batteries, followed by a second recall in 2012. A123 filed for bankruptcy in October 2012, leaving Fisker Automotive without a battery supplier. After selling approximately 2,000 units, production of the Fisker Karma was suspended in November 2012, in the absence of its battery supplier.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/59vfj5wa8w171.png?width=511&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1c03d1e1254fea00c195776122de2b26099dd35

Henrik Fisker resigned as chairman from Fisker Automotive in March 2013, because of disagreements with management about business strategy. Later that year, the company declared voluntary bankruptcy.Fisker raised and spent more than a billion dollars over its lifetime.The heart of Fisker‚Äôs business model was in that early deal with Quantum. The idea was to design a gorgeous car, and have suppliers like Quantum provide the technology because off-the-shelf parts from suppliers would help keep costs down.

But there were problems with this strategy: Sometimes, those parts had to be custom-made to fit the design vision, which resulted in higher prices for Fisker. Other times, parts were delivered late or, worse, faulty, but Fisker was locked in to those supplier relationships. Sources close to Fisker have also said that many of the parts were owned by the suppliers themselves, so Fisker didn‚Äôt own a lot of the internal technology.

The broker that raised funds for Fisker automotive, by selling their private shares, was Advanced Equities.It wasn‚Äôt until December 2011 and into 2012 that the more dubious efforts of Advanced Equities became clearer to Fisker‚Äôs hundreds of investors. The last few hundred million dollars of Advanced Equities‚Äô fund raising for Fisker, starting with the D-1 round, was what brokers call ‚Äúpay to play.‚Äù As Fisker was running into technical, delivery and political problems, its valuation was quickly declining. But the company still needed more money, so the brokers went back to its current investors and said: Unless you give this more, your current shares will be diluted and your preferred stock will be converted to common stock.

It was essentially a gun to their heads. This is why investor Wray sued Fisker in February 2012, alleging he was on the receiving end of this tactic. In his lawsuit, he says Advanced Equities sent him a letter dated Jan. 18, 2012, stating that he needed to decide if he wanted to invest in Fisker‚Äôs next round, and pay around $84,000 by Jan. 27, 2012 ‚Äî a little over a week from receiving the letter. He also says that Advanced Equities assured him that he would have anti-dilution protection. According to the audio clip from Advanced Equities‚Äô internal sales call in early 2010, Advanced Equity leaders say that the Fisker deal will ‚Äúsuffer no dilution,‚Äù and was ‚Äúa dream scenario.‚Äù

That dream would soon end. In September 2012 after Fisker closed on $1.2 billion in funding, the bulk of it organized by Advanced Equities, the SEC charged the broker with misleading investors when it raised money for another company back in 2009 and 2010 (Bloom Energy). Advanced settled, agreeing to pay $1 million, and its co-founders were personally fined. Two months later Advanced Equities closed up shop.

Later, A123 Systems itself went bankrupt, causing more problems for Fisker. Fisker claimed that A123 Systems owed it $140 million, but a bankruptcy settlement reduced that to a paltry $15 million.

Then there was the just plain terrible luck for the ironically named Karma: Super Storm Sandy wiped out 338 of its Karmas in storage in New Jersey. The cars first drowned, and then caught on fire ‚Äî salt water damage caused a short circuit that was spread to other cars by high winds, Fisker said at the time.

With all of this happening in public ‚Äî and in a presidential election year ‚Äî Fisker‚Äôs struggles became highly politicized. The company was mentioned numerous times in presidential debates and speeches leading up to the election. Republican nominee Romney called Fisker and other DOE-supported companies losers.

The company didn‚Äôt seem to invest substantially in technology innovation or tech IP, and seemed to spend a disproportionate amount on suppliers. For example, numerous sources have said that the company paid upfront for 15,000 of some of the parts for its planned 15,000 Karmas. It ended up only selling around 2,000 of the cars. It has also been said that Fisker paid some funds upfront to have BMW make engines for the 100,000 Nina cars it hoped to produce ‚Äî in the end, Fisker didn‚Äôt deliver a single Nina.

Costs to build each Karma also creeped up because the company missed its volume targets, and because engineering had to change designs around supplier constraints. The company ended up adding $20,000 to its initial sale price.

Expensive hires may also have sucked away chunks of Fisker‚Äôs funding: Sources say that Fisker filled the upper levels of the company with seasoned auto executives from Detroit. At the high point of Fisker, the company had around 300 employees, plus dozens of contract staff. Bringing in a certain amount of the old guard could help a car startup ramp up quickly, and also impress potential investors with ‚Äúindustry names.‚Äù But those people are also used to big auto-industry budgets that included extensive travel and salaries ‚Äî that‚Äôs the opposite life of a tech startup.

## Fisker Inc.

In July 2016, Henrik Fisker expressed interest in designing a fully connected electric car with autonomous driving features and an aesthetically pleasing look. He has pursued battery technology, and hinted at potentially reviving the Fisker name with a pure-electric vehicle using technology that nobody else has. Since then Fisker has talked about delays to the promised solid state battery technology, which he does not expect to be able to be produced in volume until at least 2025. Posing risk for competition from more scientifically experienced future solid state battery producers such as Quantumscape.

***Forbes:*** ‚ÄúNow he‚Äôs back‚Äìand three things are different. First and foremost, he has a vital new partner: his wife, cofounder and Fisker Inc. CFO Geeta Gupta-Fisker. Second, his Los Angeles-based company is public this time around, raising more than $1 billion in an October 2020 IPO. And finally, Fisker‚Äôs stock price, up 56% since its debut, has made both Henrik and Geeta billionaires, each worth about $1.1 billion as of Friday‚Äôs market close. The auto industry has seen father-son and sibling leadership teams, but Fisker Inc.‚Äôs CEO-CFO combo is the fast-changing sector‚Äôs first husband and wife power couple.‚Äù

Wealth isn‚Äôt the purpose of the new company, Henrik says. ‚ÄúI never got into cars because of money. (This shows he is willing to do what is in the best interest of the company because he is not motivated by money, unlike 99% of other CEO‚Äôs)

The couple sought a big stake in the new venture to ensure they can control its fate in a way Fisker couldn‚Äôt with his earlier company.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yzhded6pfw171.png?width=408&format=png&auto=webp&s=54b30259720cf853a8efeacf058f2f74315260b9

Henrik is an auto industry celebrity, but Geeta‚Äôs background is equally impressive. A native of India, she holds multiple degrees in science, including a Ph.D. in biotechnology from Cambridge University where she was also a Research Newton Fellow. From there, she started a career in international investment for Lloyds Banking Group, and then managed investments for a high-net-worth client for several years. (In particular, this is insanely important - Geeta **KNOWS MONEY**! She knows how best to keep a company afloat, organize its share structure, provide value to shareholders, etc. because she has worked in the industry before. She may just be the most important element of Fisker Inc., due to the financial experience she has. At every step of the way, she is likely to make decisions with one sole focus - increasing share price and value).

She met her future husband in 2011 when he was visiting London, just before things started going very wrong at Fisker Automotive. They married in 2012.

‚ÄúWhen I left Fisker Automotive, all I had was my car,‚Äù Henrik remembers. ‚ÄúI'm in a different position, mainly because of Geeta. Because she cuts the deals.‚Äù

To get the new venture off the ground, the Fiskers invested the majority of their life savings‚Äìan enormous financial risk given the fate of Henrik‚Äôs prior company. Then, just as they were locking in plans for the IPO back in July, they were hit by a highly unwelcome complication: Geeta learned she had early-stage breast cancer.

‚ÄúShe got the call (from her doctor) during a call with investors,‚Äù Henrik says. Despite that bombshell, she continued working with banks and investors in the weeks that followed, even as she underwent two surgical procedures and radiation therapy. Her medical therapy concluded in November.

Henrik, who marvels at her fortitude throughout the health crisis says, ‚Äúshe only missed something like one day of work...That's just how she is. She works tirelessly.‚Äù

## Fisker Ocean

The Fisker Ocean will have a nearly 300-mile range with an 80 kWh battery and a solar panel roof as a range extender, adding approximately 1,000 free miles of range per year. Advanced electronics will be housed under the hood, and the vehicle will incorporate recycled and sustainable materials throughout. Deliveries of the Ocean are scheduled to begin in 2022.

Fisker has also announced a partnership with Electrify America to ensure Fisker Ocean vehicles will integrate seamlessly with Electrify America charging stations when the e-SUV hits the market. With features such as a solar roof and recycled inner materials, it will be, according to Fisker Inc., the ""world's most sustainable vehicle.""

In 2017, Fisker Inc. announced that it had filed patents on flexible solid-state battery designs. Fisker expected the batteries to be produced on a mass scale around 2020. A prototype of the battery debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018. In October 2018, Fisker announced new funding for battery development through Caterpillar Venture Capital. The solid-state batteries are intended to deliver longer vehicle range and faster charging times.

In 2018, Fisker was named to the board of directors of First Cobalt, a North American cobalt refinery that produces battery materials.

In September 2019, it was announced that Fisker Inc. was partnering with Game of Thrones actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who will serve as a partner and sustainability adviser to Fisker, to work on advanced, affordable, electric mobility models.

[In addition to being a well-known actor, Coster-Waldau is also the United Nations Development Program Goodwill Ambassador for climate change and other social issues.](https://preview.redd.it/3hssff5vfw171.png?width=451&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebe55e2468c5b63d1bc0ac3c71547219dff5afaa)

Nikolaj wrote this piece about Fisker:

To quote a friend of mine who is a lot smarter than me, architect Bjarke Ingels: ‚ÄúThe idea that sustainability needs to sacrifice quality of life is a flawed one. It‚Äôs a design challenge, a challenge to build something that transforms the idea of sustainability into something that will increase the quality of life for all those around it.‚Äù

One person meeting that challenge is Henrik Fisker, who has designed some of the most iconic cars over the past decades for BMW and others, like the BMW Z8, Aston Martin DB9 and Aston Martin V8 Vantage. He‚Äôs a hero for gas-guzzling supercars. He is a fellow Dane, I am a fan, and we met, of all places, on Twitter.

When we met in person, he described his new project ‚Äî an all-electric luxury SUV ‚Äî and asked me if I would help spread the word on his car. The problem as I see it with most electric cars is that they only accomplish the basics. They get you from point A to B. They run electric so you don‚Äôt pollute while driving, but that‚Äôs it. They are basically unattractive combustion engine cars that have a battery thrown into them ‚Äî and for most of them, a battery with a limited range. What Fisker does is to try to make every part of the car in a sustainable and attractive way, like a full-length solar roof, recycled floor mats and vegan leather seats. It looks incredibly cool and inviting, with a great 250- to 300-mile range, and at a cost of just under $40,000, it‚Äôs a luxury car affordable to a mass market.

I said yes and even became an investor, not only because it‚Äôs a great car but more importantly, I hope and believe it can inspire other companies to actively incorporate sustainability goals into all aspects of their business. Fisker then had the idea of calling me ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù adviser. Which I am not. Just to be clear. Thanks Henrik, sounds cool, but I am an actor and a citizen, and that‚Äôs really it.

And what about Hollywood? Is our industry changing, are we at the forefront? Looking at social media, you would think so. And things are happening, but usually only when a camera is pointed at people. Remember a few years back when all awards shows only used EVs for the red carpet? We made a difference. We mattered. We showed the way. So cool. So green, so ‚Ä¶ brief. Now it‚Äôs back to the Escalade. But hey, we are not using plastic straws anymore!

To believe that change will come from Hollywood is not really based in reality (when did that stop us?), but we are great at reacting ‚Äî and things around us are changing, and changing us. I have a good friend who loves his SUV. It‚Äôs not electric. But he cannot give up his car. He is a good guy, he‚Äôs works for the U.N., so if he has a problem going electric, we all do. But if he is presented with an alternative that doesn‚Äôt mean a reduction in his quality of life, something like the Fisker SUV, I think he‚Äôd transition to electric in a heartbeat.

The IPO deal values Fisker Inc at US$2.9 billion, with an IPO share price of $10.

On July 30, 2020, Fisker announced plans for a four-vehicle portfolio by 2025. The Fisker Ocean SUV will be joined by a sports sedan based on their previously announced Fisker Emotion concept, a coupe-like SUV, and a lifestyle pickup truck. All will be electric vehicles.

On October 15, 2020, Fisker Inc announced it would be outsourcing vehicle production of its Fisker Ocean electric SUV to Magna Steyr, to reduce the complexities and costs related to the building and operating its own factory. Magna will start building the Fisker Ocean in Europe in 2022.

## Henrik Fisker Interview quotes:

I have people on Twitter saying, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just make the car next month? You have a prototype.‚Äù Most people don‚Äôt understand that it takes 18 months to do long-lead body tooling for high-volume vehicles. Most people don‚Äôt understand it takes two years to do durability tests and do all the engineering certification and everything else.

And on the business model itself, I believe that there is nobody in the near future or the next couple of years that‚Äôs going to make a million EVs on one model. Today, there‚Äôs nobody doing it. Tesla probably has the highest volume of one single model, a couple hundred thousand. But even the big giant established carmakers are not making, right now, a couple hundred thousand vehicles of one model. So the way you get volume, in my view, is if you partner up with other OEMs and share some of the expensive parts of the platform, which in my view is not anymore something that is unique IP or something that is a unique experience to the customer. An aluminum stamped floor or a steel stamped floor really doesn‚Äôt have any brand value anymore.

And obviously, as we move forward, we always start to do some of the things ourselves. But it was really about de-risking in our first vehicle to market. So we‚Äôre going to do another three vehicles, which we can do because we don‚Äôt have to spend all our money and effort on learning how to manufacture a car, for instance.

So we have programmed a lot. We have hired a head of ESG, environmental and social governance, and he is really spearheading developing specific... we kind of put out some goals that we would like to reach with suppliers, and we at least try to bring them in that direction. They are not reaching those goals right now, but they may reach them later. And then we have goals for ourselves. So for instance, we look at transport. Are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs closer to the plant, or are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs on the other side of the planet that way we have to then transport all that stuff. So those are the types of things that we‚Äôre really thinking about now as we‚Äôre nominating suppliers. And finally, materials as well, looking at sustainable materials. We‚Äôve actually picked up a lot of knowledge on that side as well, where we are adding more sustainable materials to our vehicle. So we are actually looking across everything ‚Äî supply chain, where the suppliers are located, what the suppliers are doing for sustainability, and also then of course in the vehicle itself ‚Äî in terms of the type of materials there.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nb8ozukrpw171.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd5a515f831dedcc57b25d717c5c133c0c74299d

So - let's summarize - prices are rising at their fastest pace in almost 30 years and incomes just plunged by their most ever! We're gonna need more stimmies!""  

Plus  to above; 

Last year, Hirschman Capital noted that since 1821, 98% of sovereigns that hit 130% debt/GDP have defaulted on their sovereign debt.   

The US hit 130% late last year. 

Simple Conclussion : The Fed can‚Äôt go ‚Äúhawkish‚Äù and raise rates without sending markets ‚Äìand economies‚Äìto their knees; by extension, they now have nothing left to ‚Äúcut‚Äù when the current everything bubble implodes.

And that  is a *real problem*.

 There are only two ways for sovereigns to default: 

Inflation or collapse.    

The latter is not an option. 

 As for a solution, what‚Äôs so tragic is that the only option before the Fed is an even bigger problem‚Äîcurrent and inevitably more inflation. 

 That is, if the Fed wants to keep markets (and their job security) breathing, they no longer have the foregoing template of ‚Äúrate-hike-followed-by-rate-cutting‚Äù at their disposal, which means they now have no choice but to dovishly keep rates near the zero-bound indefinitely.

But the only way to keep rates ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù and nailed to the floor of time is to purchase otherwise unwanted bonds to keep their prices elevated and hence yields and rates repressed.

Such bond ‚Äúaccommodation,‚Äù of course, costs money, and as we already know, the only ‚Äúmoney‚Äù the Fed has to spend is the kind they create out of thin air‚Äì the very kind of money (and policy) which leads to the kind of inflation discussed above‚Äînamely, the brutal kind.

 As for that fake money, the evidence of the Fed‚Äôs desperate (and only) direction is now obvious, as the following M2 money supply makes equally clear. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v774ta55sw171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e73c839beb67a67eea9aed7de4ac61d86813840

 

Fed is so embarrassed by this ‚Äúprinting solution‚Äù that they‚Äôve stopped *weekly* reporting of M2 data, and frankly, since March, have even stopped *monthly* reporting of the same.

That, of course, is both telling as well as disgraceful‚Ä¶ The Fed literally has something to hide, and that never bodes well, does it?

&#x200B;

 The correlation to central bank balance sheet (i.e., money supply) expansion and rising markets is now beyond dispute. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sgizb6xcsw171.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=aad2fe681fe0c49ac20368aba77e86c118b22959

 In short‚Äîdo you see the correlation and pattern? Do you see how the Fed‚Äôs market sausage is made? More importantly, do you now see the Fed‚Äôs self-made conundrum? 

 

Given that the Fed bows to the markets not the people, which choice do you think they‚Äôll make?

In other words, expect more money printing and more yield curve control‚Äîand hence more money creation, more inflation, and by extension more fiat currency debasement.

 More money supply to keep rates monetized simply means more currency debasement and rising inflation.",nn51ou,"""Fed's ""Favorite"" #Inflation Indicator (PCE) Explodes At Fastest Rate Since 1992 As Incomes Crash By Record"""

I have leading indicators telling me that there are two concurrent shifts underway when it comes to who is purchasing homes.

\- Massive increase in unmarried people buying houses alone. This used to be somewhat unusual, now it's becoming very common.

\- Massive increase in unmarried men, in particular, buying houses alone. Traditionally, the female-to-male ratio of unmarried homebuyers was about 5 to 1. For the last 3 months, it's been closer to 50/50.

Source is my own closed real estate purchase transactions. Am a mortgage broker (btw this means cash purchases are ""invisible"" to me). It takes 3-6 months for [HMDA data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Mortgage_Disclosure_Act) to become accessible to journalists and academics, and thus ""visible"" to the general public (assuming journalists deem it worthy of commenting on), but I can see the trends live in real time.

How would one go about placing a bet that in about 3 or 6 months, the media, journalists, academics, etc, will pick up on this, publish articles, and potentially cause a lot of people to buy certain stocks. Which stocks would that be? Is there a ""Mancave, Inc"" out there that would potentially get an uptick? Or maybe a company making smart-home stuff that is particularly suited to renting by the room (the single men are not buying 1 bedroom condos, they are buying proper houses with 3 bedrooms, etc)?

EDIT: oh, and to be clear. It's not just an uptick in single men. It's an uptick in women too, but a massive surge from the men. It used to be that for 15 banana sales, 10 are to married couples, 4 to single women, and 1 to a single man. Now for the same 15 banana sales, it's 6 to married couples, 6 to single women, and 3 to single men, something like that.",nn76we,Homebuyer Demographics Shift towards single and male. How to bet?

I have been doing research and talking to as many people I can that have some sort of experience/knowledge when dealing with the stock market. I heard about the potential to get into AMC and make some serious profit. I invested early on when shares were selling for around $8.00. I kept reading we need to hold until June 2nd and reevaluate. That‚Äôs my current plan, but hey I don‚Äôt know much about the game lol.

My current understanding of why there is a squeeze is because of previous events which backed hedge funds into a corner. Basically the hedge funds have had to borrow shares to pay off debt to companies like GME. When borrowing those shares, hedge fund companies left themselves vulnerable because they have no more money to borrow to pay off their debt. So if everyone buys stock in AMC and holds it, then the hedge fund companies are forced to pay out. The more people that buy and hold their shares then the higher the shares are worth and over time it will pay a profit. 

Like I said, I‚Äôm new to the game and this is just my current understanding of how the masses can manipulate the stock market. Please comment and enlighten me on another view point or correct my understanding. Let‚Äôs all get rich and work together with the power of knowledge!

Hello fellow retards, I decided to yolo my whole account on some TSLA FDs that will expire next week, 56 contracts of TSLA 6/4 700c. I have my sophisticated reasons:

1. Next Monday markets close. Definitely a gap up.

2. June 3 Tesla delivery event. Not even sure what it is but definitely a huge catalyst.

3. IV is only 40ish. Definitely a signal to yolo on TSLA calls.

4. Month end of May is next week. Definitely a big push up for TSLA.

I am already thinking what color of lambo should I get. Please advise.",nnbqjv,Time to YOLO on TSLA FDs

It was on a Thursday night 02/25/2021 when I posted, at the time RKT was around 19-20 range and on the following Monday 03/01/2021 it started rallying, by 03/02 & 03/03 it hit the ATH level 43. You‚Äôre welcome to find my last DD post for verification. And for those of you who made tendies on it congratulations to you all! Spread the good energy!

As I am writing this post Today is 05/28/2021, I‚Äôll try to bring more data and technical analysis on $RKT, as you all saw what happened yesterday 05/27/2021 around lunch time upon sudden move it went from 17.50 area all the way to 19.40. This move doesn‚Äôt seem so random at all, a combination of someone noticed this to be a strategic technical squeeze just testing the water after it being suppressed down for the past 3 months, and you can see how fast the shorts started covering all of a sudden.

Today 05/28/2021, at opening it shot up to $19.20 but the shorts came prepared for $RKT this morning with their analysts and news blasting numerous articles and downgrades from Morgan Stanley, Wedbush & Zacks, ALL AT ONCE. This is certainly no coincidence.

On the technical side, on the daily chart as you can see it has a gap to fill around 22.67 area then it‚Äôll go straight to 28 and has a huge potential to pass beyond that and make it to a new all-time high, there‚Äôs nothing stopping it. On the daily MACD closed red and turned green, RSI is at the same level as last time before it squeezed to ATH $43, Parabolic S.A.R indicator flipped from red on the daily to green for the first time in 3 months. Another important factor is as you look at the volume and candle compared to last time it exploded (both red arrows) same volume, same price action.

Conclusion: the shorts are basically scared sh\*tless right now and they know it, is a tickle to the trigger for it to explode again like last time or even higher. Based on Excess Returns Model the fair value for RKT is $85, so why haven't we seen $100 yet?

At the rate we are seeing, in 6 months the Comex will be out of silver to settle contracts with.

However, that is assuming that they haven't leased out much of that silver already and do not actually have access to it. The substantial upward movement in price that I personally believe is coming could happen much sooner.

7230,,2021-05-29 02:43:46,t3_nndrnf,,wallstreetbets,"AMC price will soar because:
1. AMC is officially off the bankruptcy zone, thanks to the over $2 billion equity and debt capital the company currently has. The capital can last the company for the foreseeable future. Therefore, the risk of bankruptcy makes investors confident. This will likely further drive up stock prices as more investors buy the stock.
2. AMC's recent rise in market value and share price increases have been largely driven by Reddit investors who the company says own over 80% of the company's over 480 million shares outstanding. We can expect the price to keep soaring as Reddit and other social media-based investors keep making the company's stock more and more popular on social media.
3. AMC stock will likely rise to $100,000 due to the ongoing short squeeze to force short-sellers such as hedge funds to cover their losses. Short-sellers have already made millions of dollars in losses and as the short squeeze continues, share prices are expected to grow.
4. AMC stock is one of the most shorted stocks at the moment. The fact that the stock is shorted makes it more likely for share prices to keep increasing as short-sellers are forced to abandon their positions and cover losses.
5. AMC theaters are back in business after movie theater closures due to Covid regulations. The company's movie theaters are already selling out all their tickets, thereby attracting investors who see hope for the industry and expect profits to grow as the economy continues to reopen.
6. AMC's CEO Adam Aron is inspiring the Reddit investors to continue supporting the stock and become customers by going to its movie theaters. The CEO has gone ahead to increase his online activities on Twitter to engage the investors and listen to their concerns. The continuous appreciation of the online-based investors by the company's CEO will likely push the stock price higher in the coming days.

8. Big companies such as the Vanguard Group are currently buying AMC stock. The fact that big companies are willing to buy rather than sell the stock shows that they believe in a positive future for the company. These big companies encourage other institutional investors to buy the stock, thereby increasing stock prices.
9. Recent announcements by the Securities Exchange Commission that it is reviewing short-selling rules to properly protect small investors may also be a factor in contributing to further increases in AMC stock prices. If small investors know that the SEC will establish rules to protect them from the short positions adopted by hedge bets, then more small investors may be inclined to invest in AMC stock effectively increasing share prices.
10. Recent battles between small online-based investors such as those on Reddit and large hedge funds who mostly take on short positions (short-sellers) that result in job losses are also driving up and will keep driving up AMC stock. Online-based investors continue to develop a liking for shorted stocks in order to stick it up to big hedge funds. Besides, AMC is currently one of the most held stocks at the moment. This will keep driving up share prices.",nndrnf,It is just the beginning... üçø

-Saw a certain Friday DD.  If you know, know.  Didn't like what it said.

-OIP showed us a few weeks ago what the bots over on subreddit simulator act like.  Eerily similar to here.  You ever get in conversations where you're not really certain the person you're talking to is even directly responding to what you wrote?  Not even just bad logic or differences in opinion..  Like, the words just don't make sense as a response.  

-I went back a few months to read how we were all talking about GME and our potential to move markets, when it was clear that GME was going to blast the fuck off but BEFORE the squeeze.  We were still in the 40-60 range.  We got a visit from an actual hedge fund manager at that point in time, telling us we were headed in the right direction.

How many of the apes around here are just bots?  We never really moved on from ""the two stocks.""  I know lots of people here made money this week, but...

1) how much of the diamond hands sentiment is just to ensure retail plays its useful idiot role for HF's to make money on low liquidity stocks, and to ensure they can liquidate into the strength of frenzied buyers.  I.e. the big boys realize gains at the top while retail buys the top and holds it all the way down 

2) the thing we were so giddy about, the strength of retail, is never going to happen if retail at large is fixated on two stocks that aren't very important, keep all their liquidity locked up, and drown out other potential plays.

Anyway,

Everything looked to have gone off successfully. We are now waiting on the data and craft to be analysed and inspected. This will take a few weeks according to Michael Colglazier.
That being said he had already outlined the test schedule in the earnings zoom call.

1st test flight - may 
2nd crewed flight - June 
3rd flight with R Branson on board late June/July 

4th flight this will be taking the Italian airforce on a training mission (600k a seat) late July


On the run in to the first test flight some possible maintenance issues appeared with the carrier plane White knight 2‚Ä¶. 
This indeed could have gone either way , after 2 weeks inspections it was decided that WK2 did not need to delay testing no maintenance was needed at this point. Scheduled Maintenance will commence in the fall after all tests have been completed.
Upon this news it is my opinion that the testing programme will go ahead as planned.

The market has responded accordingly and the stock is now up from $17-‚Ç¨31

With all these catalysts lined up before the end of the year and commercial operations looming for early 2022 things are looking up for Virgin Galactic.The success of the last test flight the company have now proven tech and concept. 
Also with revenue now coming in Nasa who are conducting micro gravity analysis.
Also international training for military pilots and astronauts.

I had a look at $BB and assume that we finally formed the bottom. In the last few days we saw a sharp rise which might continue in the next weeks. If we can break the 12$ resistance, the next targets would be aroung 25-28$. 

Using Elliot wave theory we are probably at the end of the correction wave 4 and now began with the bullish wave 5.

Price targets:

\#1 12$

\#2 25$

7453,,2021-05-28 09:17:32,t3_nmtt43,,wallstreetbets,"Trainline has taken a huge dip since the UK government's announcement of the plan to nationalise the railway network. The plan includes creating an online ticketing platform by Great British Railways which might have a huge blow on Trainline revenue. However, this platform does not yet exist and will probably take a couple of years to develop. Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed.

In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales.  Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%.

I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time  for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

7458,,2021-05-28 10:41:01,t3_nmuzzi,,wallstreetbets,"Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent of Modernas if not more. Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects) 

Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

Imagine if the spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize one piece to understand the whole picture it and helps modify your DNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates it can still recognize the virus. In contrast to using one portion of the picture as it mutates it's easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine, that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. Not only that but they have had the least amount of side effects of any covid vaccine deeming it the safest covid vaccine.... 

And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein (whole picture) and the safety profile. Also worth a mention is that you could store it in a regular refrigerator, and let it sit out in room temperature while you're vaccinating people instead of a special ultra low temp freeze needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers, this is a majority of the world. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines so other protein competitors will be far behind and they will have an a moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing they teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine. They will be combining flu and covid vaccine by 2025 for possibly double the price of current covid vaccine.

 They are pretty much de-risked at this point. Yes you could buy other  biotechs that can go up 20x but are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up) that has all successful trials done so far, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment to where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place there are no more glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""

They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. Yesterday at market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. 
 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

Future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract in there ( in the link below in another message). It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 

As far as my position I own some $200 July calls along with about 933 shares. I'm all in baby.  Been in since $4.06, I panicked and sold once during February a couple months during the mini bear market we had and got back in a bit too early so got a wash sale üôà but I'm diamond hands all the way to $800 from here.  LFG I expect to turn that into a cool million in a year's time via shares and options based on the DD provided. Just know this isn't all completely my DD some of this is taken from my good friends at the community Nvax community on Stocktwits. They're one of the most hardcore groups that provides excellent DD and are always willing to help each other a hand if anyone's got questions highly recommend to check it out. So my point is this is information collected over the months that is a group consensus on nvax future price. (Check out next link below this paragraph, it has My positions and an amazing DD chart converting contracts to future price and comparing with competitors. My screen name on stovktwits  is the same on there Johnnyknowsbest. Been on there and here since i started with nvax.

Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. This is huge as the combo is going to differentiate them especially since both flu and covid vaccines are first in class.

# SPY SG:

Looks like low volatility day. Play tight.

Note from SG: ""For todays expiration our models show about 15% SPX /30% SPY gamma expiring, which could allow volatility increase a bit into next week. This in turn may free markets for a push up into that 4250 target (Call Wall) area.""

Gamma Index: decreased to -0.1 (A large negative figure indicates volatility may be high. The range is from 4 to ‚Äì4.)

Vol Trigger: Increased to 419 (Important support and resistance level. (above this level = lower volatility and a more stable stock price.)

Abs Gamma Strike: Unchanged

Gamma Notional: Decreased to $-516 (stock has larger put gamma position. A negative gamma position implies higher volatility in the underlying)

Put Wall Support: Increased to 419 (If Put Wall shifts to a higher strike it could be a bearish indication)

Call Wall Strike: Increased to 425 (When this strike is rolled higher it is generally considered bullish)

Gamma Tilt: Decreased to 0.88	 (when decreasing it‚Äôs a bearish signal.)

Net Delta: Increased to 198k (positive delta position infers options market makers have a net long hedge.)

25d risk reversal: Increased to -0.06 (When the ratio shifts towards 0 it indicates call demand)

1) We look to the PTON CFO's statement found in the latest earnings call transcript, for guidance:
""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior.""
2) Being that we do not have access to a 10-K filing for Q4 fiscal '19, we will access other filings that do in fact reference numbers from fiscal '19...
A) 10-K filing dated 9/11/2020
B) 10-Q filing dated 5/6/2020
3) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $223.3M under Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19)
But, that is TOTAL Revenue; we need to find out what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike sales...
4) To calculate what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike Sales, we can use numbers from neighboring Q3 (i.e. Three Months Ended March 31, 2019)...
A) On page 6 of the 10-Q, you will find Revenue of ""Connected Fitness Products"" (aka Bike Sales) to be $261.6M
B) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $316.7M
C) % of Bike Sales per TOTAL Revenue: $261.6M / $316.7M * 100 = 82.6% {""Connected Fitness Products"" Revenue (aka Bike Sales)}
5) Apply 82.6% to the TOTAL Revenue $223.3M for Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19): $223.3M x 0.826 = $184.45M {Bike Sales for Q4 of fiscal '19}
6) Per the CFO, ""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior."":

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote... By mid-July, we‚Äôll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase precious metals  especially silver amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative 

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

Gold rose over 60% in the 1930s as the prices of stocks and real estate crashed. You could buy an entire block with a one ounce gold coin. Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms.

I must address Cramer's statement because he is obviously trying to add fuel to the short-selling fire: When he says ""we're not going natural gas"" he is clearly making a vague and general statement meant to be interpreted in the worst possible way: ""no one is going to buy or use natural gas."" By now, I hope everyone that is interested in this stock understands that CLNE offers an alternative transportation fuel, thus, the investments made by BP and Chevron, and not revolutionary technology like some EV's (but this is mostly hype meant to catapult EVs to the front. What most people do not realize is that driverless technology and such can be placed in Petro vehicles too). Also, unfortunately, the company has done a terrible marketting job. That's why powerful analysts can get away with making vague and unsupported statements. The fact that Cramer explained the stock's decrease over the last month as being due to widespread dissaproval is misleading, at best. Many people do not yet know about the cleanliness and therapeutic effects RNG has on the climate.

The News...

If you haven't read yet it looks like Federal Cannabis legalization my be around the corner. [Here](https://www.mpp.org/policy/federal/the-more-act/) is the House Bill. Supporters seem on board and like the reforms they have done to the bill including rescheduling cannabis. [Last time](https://mjbizdaily.com/key-us-house-lawmaker-reintroduces-federal-marijuana-legalization-bill/) the bill was introduced it cleared the House.   


Personally I think this gets a lot of support especially from a fiscal point of view. With stimulus stalling and a giant debate going on about how to pay for the stimulus I think cannabis offers the easiest way to collect federal revenue. A simple review of the bill and the fiscal benefits to the Fed's can be read [here](https://www.justtherealnews.com/congress/nadler-blumenauer-lee-jackson-lee-jeffries-velazquez-reintroduce-comprehensive-marijuana-reform-legislation/). The bill states a 5% fed tax. Money coming for uncle Sam, right when questions about paying for stimulus.... Personally I think it adds up, but that's for you to decide. 

Okay so that's the hype...

Let's talk about the tickers listed ($SNDL and $TLRY). 

$SNDL

I'll start with the cheaper YOLO, $SNDL. $SNDL short interest isn't high, but the company did issue convertible notes a while back around .7c if my memory is correct. I'm not saying they won't do it again, but they should be in a good place fiscally for now. Float is high with about 1.6B shares out there. However today's volume at the time of writing is over 415M. That's not bad given such a high float. It's about 200% more than the average volume. 

The options chain on $SNDL has me giddy. With over 200,000 options currently in the money on todays move above $1 there is some high potential here for some interesting action. The put to call ratio is just obnoxiously low at .08 it's screaming upwards betting. If we hold above $1 the potential squeeze up could be amazing.   


It's also broken up on the trend lines and out of the downward channel it was in. The regression channel from the peak squeeze back in Feb just broke out today according to my crayons I have laying around. 

$TLRY

$TLRY was the squeeze of a lifetime if you remember it back in 19'. The ticker was just a money printer with it's low float and stupid hype. Then they proceeded to do, like they all do, and issue debt. Shares tumbled since then falling from $120 --> $5. Ouch bag holders.   


Like all the cannabis stocks the Feb bump pushed $TLRY to above $60 in an amazing move. $TLRY has a lower short interest than $SNDL, but it also has a much lower float at about 300M. Compared to $SNDL the volume here isn't as good, but still remains decently above the avg volume around 36M as of right now. 

If we peep the options chain we also see a crazy low P/C ratio around .11. But we don't have the Open Interest in the chain like $SNDL does unless you roll out to Jun 18. Then we finally get some decent OI.   


Personally I am going with $SNDL. The option's chain looks better, the stock is cheaper, and the short interest is a little better. My advice would be to roll out till at least the Jun 11th $1 strike to not get eaten alive by Theta and IV crush. But WSB does what WSB wants and that's why I love you all.   
Do not go above the $2 strikes IMO. You will get crushed by theta unless we get an insane move, which could happen but I don't see the risk / reward there.",nn326f,MORE ACT / CANNABIS / $SNDL & $TLRY Potential

>A corner in the silver market has been tried before - and let's be clear, that is what is being attempted now.  In 1980, a rule change by the government destroyed the corner.  #silverthursday.

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday

>Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers‚Äô attempt to corner the market on the metal.

-
>Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926‚Äì2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers‚Äô Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.

-
>By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver.

Tl;dr

This is an extensive, in-depth due-diligence document, and I realize that ‚Äúain‚Äôt nobody got time for that‚Äù. So I have decided to do God‚Äôs work for him and put the tl;dr at the start, saving you all a couple hours read.

* Henrik Fisker is a God among men in the automotive industry - trust him to do right
* Geeta Gupta-Fisker is a solid Chief Financial Officer with experience in investment banking - she will ensure the shares are valued right
* Henrik has learned from all the mistakes he made with his previous attempt to create Fisker Automotive, and will certainly do everything in his power to avoid that mess again. He has designed systems into the intricacies of the company to avoid failure - meaning Fisker Inc is guaranteed to succeed
* Henrik Fisker on shorting $FSR - ‚ÄúYou will quickly understand that you stand to lose a lot of money if you show it against Fisker‚Äù
* Production of Fisker Ocean expected to start in November 2022
* 250,000+ units a year expected by 2025
* Partnerships with Foxconn and Magna Steyr, both giants in their respective industries, among others
* Large Fleet market in Europe gaining momentum, and 700+ Fisker reservations in this market alone
* 16,000+ reservations already. More than Tesla had 18 months pre-production
* Revenue streams include leasing automotives, servicing, selling emissions credits, selling insurance (like selling the pickaxe to miners, and selling the diamonds to the mine owners too, absolutely genius - Fisker are insuring cars which they own, because the customer is only leasing it)
* High short interest (20%+), high analyst price targets compared to current share price (100%+) and low valuation compared to peers ($3bn market cap currently)
* Designing the first ever all-electric popemobile - Massive, soon to be historic, event!
* I give $FSR (currently $13 a share) a price target of $100 by end of year 2022, if not sooner
* Price Targets: $35 by end of year - Previous ATH. $50 start of next year - European and Chinese debut of prototypes. $100 end of 2022 - start of production (SOP). $150+ 2023
* 2025 Price Targets, calculated using projected data: Bear case - $97 a share, Bull case - $519 a share
* Downside in the short term is capped by the large amount of cash on hand - one third of market cap is cash. Long term, is capped by risk factors, which are almost eligible and affect every automotive startup anyway.

In 2007, Tesla Motors hired Henrik Fisker to perform initial design work on the Tesla Model S electric sedan, which was introduced in 2012.

Fisker stated in 2018 that, with the growth of car-sharing, ride-hailing, and autonomous shuttles, he believes within 10 years private cars will be used for less than half of what they are currently used for.

&#x200B;

## Fisker Automotive

In 2008, Fisker Automotive raised over $90 million from investors including venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. In September 2009, Fisker Automotive was awarded a $528 million loan guarantee by the United States Department of Energy (DOE). The automaker was one of four recipients of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, to encourage the domestic manufacture of electric cars. The funds were to be used to develop the Karma, as well as an affordable family-size plug-in hybrid car. The loan facility was frozen at $192 million in February 2012, after the DOE claimed that Fisker missed its milestones

In December 2011, just as the Fisker Karma was launched, its battery supplier, A123 Systems, recalled all batteries, followed by a second recall in 2012. A123 filed for bankruptcy in October 2012, leaving Fisker Automotive without a battery supplier. After selling approximately 2,000 units, production of the Fisker Karma was suspended in November 2012, in the absence of its battery supplier.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/59vfj5wa8w171.png?width=511&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1c03d1e1254fea00c195776122de2b26099dd35

Henrik Fisker resigned as chairman from Fisker Automotive in March 2013, because of disagreements with management about business strategy. Later that year, the company declared voluntary bankruptcy.Fisker raised and spent more than a billion dollars over its lifetime.The heart of Fisker‚Äôs business model was in that early deal with Quantum. The idea was to design a gorgeous car, and have suppliers like Quantum provide the technology because off-the-shelf parts from suppliers would help keep costs down.

But there were problems with this strategy: Sometimes, those parts had to be custom-made to fit the design vision, which resulted in higher prices for Fisker. Other times, parts were delivered late or, worse, faulty, but Fisker was locked in to those supplier relationships. Sources close to Fisker have also said that many of the parts were owned by the suppliers themselves, so Fisker didn‚Äôt own a lot of the internal technology.

The broker that raised funds for Fisker automotive, by selling their private shares, was Advanced Equities.It wasn‚Äôt until December 2011 and into 2012 that the more dubious efforts of Advanced Equities became clearer to Fisker‚Äôs hundreds of investors. The last few hundred million dollars of Advanced Equities‚Äô fund raising for Fisker, starting with the D-1 round, was what brokers call ‚Äúpay to play.‚Äù As Fisker was running into technical, delivery and political problems, its valuation was quickly declining. But the company still needed more money, so the brokers went back to its current investors and said: Unless you give this more, your current shares will be diluted and your preferred stock will be converted to common stock.

It was essentially a gun to their heads. This is why investor Wray sued Fisker in February 2012, alleging he was on the receiving end of this tactic. In his lawsuit, he says Advanced Equities sent him a letter dated Jan. 18, 2012, stating that he needed to decide if he wanted to invest in Fisker‚Äôs next round, and pay around $84,000 by Jan. 27, 2012 ‚Äî a little over a week from receiving the letter. He also says that Advanced Equities assured him that he would have anti-dilution protection. According to the audio clip from Advanced Equities‚Äô internal sales call in early 2010, Advanced Equity leaders say that the Fisker deal will ‚Äúsuffer no dilution,‚Äù and was ‚Äúa dream scenario.‚Äù

That dream would soon end. In September 2012 after Fisker closed on $1.2 billion in funding, the bulk of it organized by Advanced Equities, the SEC charged the broker with misleading investors when it raised money for another company back in 2009 and 2010 (Bloom Energy). Advanced settled, agreeing to pay $1 million, and its co-founders were personally fined. Two months later Advanced Equities closed up shop.

Later, A123 Systems itself went bankrupt, causing more problems for Fisker. Fisker claimed that A123 Systems owed it $140 million, but a bankruptcy settlement reduced that to a paltry $15 million.

Then there was the just plain terrible luck for the ironically named Karma: Super Storm Sandy wiped out 338 of its Karmas in storage in New Jersey. The cars first drowned, and then caught on fire ‚Äî salt water damage caused a short circuit that was spread to other cars by high winds, Fisker said at the time.

With all of this happening in public ‚Äî and in a presidential election year ‚Äî Fisker‚Äôs struggles became highly politicized. The company was mentioned numerous times in presidential debates and speeches leading up to the election. Republican nominee Romney called Fisker and other DOE-supported companies losers.

The company didn‚Äôt seem to invest substantially in technology innovation or tech IP, and seemed to spend a disproportionate amount on suppliers. For example, numerous sources have said that the company paid upfront for 15,000 of some of the parts for its planned 15,000 Karmas. It ended up only selling around 2,000 of the cars. It has also been said that Fisker paid some funds upfront to have BMW make engines for the 100,000 Nina cars it hoped to produce ‚Äî in the end, Fisker didn‚Äôt deliver a single Nina.

Costs to build each Karma also creeped up because the company missed its volume targets, and because engineering had to change designs around supplier constraints. The company ended up adding $20,000 to its initial sale price.

Expensive hires may also have sucked away chunks of Fisker‚Äôs funding: Sources say that Fisker filled the upper levels of the company with seasoned auto executives from Detroit. At the high point of Fisker, the company had around 300 employees, plus dozens of contract staff. Bringing in a certain amount of the old guard could help a car startup ramp up quickly, and also impress potential investors with ‚Äúindustry names.‚Äù But those people are also used to big auto-industry budgets that included extensive travel and salaries ‚Äî that‚Äôs the opposite life of a tech startup.

## Fisker Inc.

In July 2016, Henrik Fisker expressed interest in designing a fully connected electric car with autonomous driving features and an aesthetically pleasing look. He has pursued battery technology, and hinted at potentially reviving the Fisker name with a pure-electric vehicle using technology that nobody else has. Since then Fisker has talked about delays to the promised solid state battery technology, which he does not expect to be able to be produced in volume until at least 2025. Posing risk for competition from more scientifically experienced future solid state battery producers such as Quantumscape.

***Forbes:*** ‚ÄúNow he‚Äôs back‚Äìand three things are different. First and foremost, he has a vital new partner: his wife, cofounder and Fisker Inc. CFO Geeta Gupta-Fisker. Second, his Los Angeles-based company is public this time around, raising more than $1 billion in an October 2020 IPO. And finally, Fisker‚Äôs stock price, up 56% since its debut, has made both Henrik and Geeta billionaires, each worth about $1.1 billion as of Friday‚Äôs market close. The auto industry has seen father-son and sibling leadership teams, but Fisker Inc.‚Äôs CEO-CFO combo is the fast-changing sector‚Äôs first husband and wife power couple.‚Äù

Wealth isn‚Äôt the purpose of the new company, Henrik says. ‚ÄúI never got into cars because of money. (This shows he is willing to do what is in the best interest of the company because he is not motivated by money, unlike 99% of other CEO‚Äôs)

The couple sought a big stake in the new venture to ensure they can control its fate in a way Fisker couldn‚Äôt with his earlier company.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yzhded6pfw171.png?width=408&format=png&auto=webp&s=54b30259720cf853a8efeacf058f2f74315260b9

Henrik is an auto industry celebrity, but Geeta‚Äôs background is equally impressive. A native of India, she holds multiple degrees in science, including a Ph.D. in biotechnology from Cambridge University where she was also a Research Newton Fellow. From there, she started a career in international investment for Lloyds Banking Group, and then managed investments for a high-net-worth client for several years. (In particular, this is insanely important - Geeta **KNOWS MONEY**! She knows how best to keep a company afloat, organize its share structure, provide value to shareholders, etc. because she has worked in the industry before. She may just be the most important element of Fisker Inc., due to the financial experience she has. At every step of the way, she is likely to make decisions with one sole focus - increasing share price and value).

She met her future husband in 2011 when he was visiting London, just before things started going very wrong at Fisker Automotive. They married in 2012.

‚ÄúWhen I left Fisker Automotive, all I had was my car,‚Äù Henrik remembers. ‚ÄúI'm in a different position, mainly because of Geeta. Because she cuts the deals.‚Äù

To get the new venture off the ground, the Fiskers invested the majority of their life savings‚Äìan enormous financial risk given the fate of Henrik‚Äôs prior company. Then, just as they were locking in plans for the IPO back in July, they were hit by a highly unwelcome complication: Geeta learned she had early-stage breast cancer.

‚ÄúShe got the call (from her doctor) during a call with investors,‚Äù Henrik says. Despite that bombshell, she continued working with banks and investors in the weeks that followed, even as she underwent two surgical procedures and radiation therapy. Her medical therapy concluded in November.

Henrik, who marvels at her fortitude throughout the health crisis says, ‚Äúshe only missed something like one day of work...That's just how she is. She works tirelessly.‚Äù

## Fisker Ocean

The Fisker Ocean will have a nearly 300-mile range with an 80 kWh battery and a solar panel roof as a range extender, adding approximately 1,000 free miles of range per year. Advanced electronics will be housed under the hood, and the vehicle will incorporate recycled and sustainable materials throughout. Deliveries of the Ocean are scheduled to begin in 2022.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s87j6bdsfw171.png?width=438&format=png&auto=webp&s=e40add9ce53319d31db242cce73a303afb03cbab

Fisker has also announced a partnership with Electrify America to ensure Fisker Ocean vehicles will integrate seamlessly with Electrify America charging stations when the e-SUV hits the market. With features such as a solar roof and recycled inner materials, it will be, according to Fisker Inc., the ""world's most sustainable vehicle.""

In 2017, Fisker Inc. announced that it had filed patents on flexible solid-state battery designs. Fisker expected the batteries to be produced on a mass scale around 2020. A prototype of the battery debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018. In October 2018, Fisker announced new funding for battery development through Caterpillar Venture Capital. The solid-state batteries are intended to deliver longer vehicle range and faster charging times.

In 2018, Fisker was named to the board of directors of First Cobalt, a North American cobalt refinery that produces battery materials.

In September 2019, it was announced that Fisker Inc. was partnering with Game of Thrones actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who will serve as a partner and sustainability adviser to Fisker, to work on advanced, affordable, electric mobility models.

&#x200B;

[In addition to being a well-known actor, Coster-Waldau is also the United Nations Development Program Goodwill Ambassador for climate change and other social issues.](https://preview.redd.it/3hssff5vfw171.png?width=451&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebe55e2468c5b63d1bc0ac3c71547219dff5afaa)

Nikolaj wrote this piece about Fisker:

To quote a friend of mine who is a lot smarter than me, architect Bjarke Ingels: ‚ÄúThe idea that sustainability needs to sacrifice quality of life is a flawed one. It‚Äôs a design challenge, a challenge to build something that transforms the idea of sustainability into something that will increase the quality of life for all those around it.‚Äù

One person meeting that challenge is Henrik Fisker, who has designed some of the most iconic cars over the past decades for BMW and others, like the BMW Z8, Aston Martin DB9 and Aston Martin V8 Vantage. He‚Äôs a hero for gas-guzzling supercars. He is a fellow Dane, I am a fan, and we met, of all places, on Twitter.

When we met in person, he described his new project ‚Äî an all-electric luxury SUV ‚Äî and asked me if I would help spread the word on his car. The problem as I see it with most electric cars is that they only accomplish the basics. They get you from point A to B. They run electric so you don‚Äôt pollute while driving, but that‚Äôs it. They are basically unattractive combustion engine cars that have a battery thrown into them ‚Äî and for most of them, a battery with a limited range. What Fisker does is to try to make every part of the car in a sustainable and attractive way, like a full-length solar roof, recycled floor mats and vegan leather seats. It looks incredibly cool and inviting, with a great 250- to 300-mile range, and at a cost of just under $40,000, it‚Äôs a luxury car affordable to a mass market.

I said yes and even became an investor, not only because it‚Äôs a great car but more importantly, I hope and believe it can inspire other companies to actively incorporate sustainability goals into all aspects of their business. Fisker then had the idea of calling me ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù adviser. Which I am not. Just to be clear. Thanks Henrik, sounds cool, but I am an actor and a citizen, and that‚Äôs really it.

And what about Hollywood? Is our industry changing, are we at the forefront? Looking at social media, you would think so. And things are happening, but usually only when a camera is pointed at people. Remember a few years back when all awards shows only used EVs for the red carpet? We made a difference. We mattered. We showed the way. So cool. So green, so ‚Ä¶ brief. Now it‚Äôs back to the Escalade. But hey, we are not using plastic straws anymore!

To believe that change will come from Hollywood is not really based in reality (when did that stop us?), but we are great at reacting ‚Äî and things around us are changing, and changing us. I have a good friend who loves his SUV. It‚Äôs not electric. But he cannot give up his car. He is a good guy, he‚Äôs works for the U.N., so if he has a problem going electric, we all do. But if he is presented with an alternative that doesn‚Äôt mean a reduction in his quality of life, something like the Fisker SUV, I think he‚Äôd transition to electric in a heartbeat.

The IPO deal values Fisker Inc at US$2.9 billion, with an IPO share price of $10.

On July 30, 2020, Fisker announced plans for a four-vehicle portfolio by 2025. The Fisker Ocean SUV will be joined by a sports sedan based on their previously announced Fisker Emotion concept, a coupe-like SUV, and a lifestyle pickup truck. All will be electric vehicles.

On October 15, 2020, Fisker Inc announced it would be outsourcing vehicle production of its Fisker Ocean electric SUV to Magna Steyr, to reduce the complexities and costs related to the building and operating its own factory. Magna will start building the Fisker Ocean in Europe in 2022.

## Henrik Fisker Interview quotes:

I have people on Twitter saying, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just make the car next month? You have a prototype.‚Äù Most people don‚Äôt understand that it takes 18 months to do long-lead body tooling for high-volume vehicles. Most people don‚Äôt understand it takes two years to do durability tests and do all the engineering certification and everything else.

And on the business model itself, I believe that there is nobody in the near future or the next couple of years that‚Äôs going to make a million EVs on one model. Today, there‚Äôs nobody doing it. Tesla probably has the highest volume of one single model, a couple hundred thousand. But even the big giant established carmakers are not making, right now, a couple hundred thousand vehicles of one model. So the way you get volume, in my view, is if you partner up with other OEMs and share some of the expensive parts of the platform, which in my view is not anymore something that is unique IP or something that is a unique experience to the customer. An aluminum stamped floor or a steel stamped floor really doesn‚Äôt have any brand value anymore.

And obviously, as we move forward, we always start to do some of the things ourselves. But it was really about de-risking in our first vehicle to market. So we‚Äôre going to do another three vehicles, which we can do because we don‚Äôt have to spend all our money and effort on learning how to manufacture a car, for instance.

So we have programmed a lot. We have hired a head of ESG, environmental and social governance, and he is really spearheading developing specific... we kind of put out some goals that we would like to reach with suppliers, and we at least try to bring them in that direction. They are not reaching those goals right now, but they may reach them later. And then we have goals for ourselves. So for instance, we look at transport. Are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs closer to the plant, or are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs on the other side of the planet that way we have to then transport all that stuff. So those are the types of things that we‚Äôre really thinking about now as we‚Äôre nominating suppliers. And finally, materials as well, looking at sustainable materials. We‚Äôve actually picked up a lot of knowledge on that side as well, where we are adding more sustainable materials to our vehicle. So we are actually looking across everything ‚Äî supply chain, where the suppliers are located, what the suppliers are doing for sustainability, and also then of course in the vehicle itself ‚Äî in terms of the type of materials there.

So - let's summarize - prices are rising at their fastest pace in almost 30 years and incomes just plunged by their most ever! We're gonna need more stimmies!""  

Plus  to above; 

Last year, Hirschman Capital noted that since 1821, 98% of sovereigns that hit 130% debt/GDP have defaulted on their sovereign debt.   

The US hit 130% late last year. 

Simple Conclussion : The Fed can‚Äôt go ‚Äúhawkish‚Äù and raise rates without sending markets ‚Äìand economies‚Äìto their knees; by extension, they now have nothing left to ‚Äúcut‚Äù when the current everything bubble implodes.

And that  is a *real problem*.

 There are only two ways for sovereigns to default: 

Inflation or collapse.    

The latter is not an option. 

 As for a solution, what‚Äôs so tragic is that the only option before the Fed is an even bigger problem‚Äîcurrent and inevitably more inflation. 

 That is, if the Fed wants to keep markets (and their job security) breathing, they no longer have the foregoing template of ‚Äúrate-hike-followed-by-rate-cutting‚Äù at their disposal, which means they now have no choice but to dovishly keep rates near the zero-bound indefinitely.

But the only way to keep rates ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù and nailed to the floor of time is to purchase otherwise unwanted bonds to keep their prices elevated and hence yields and rates repressed.

Such bond ‚Äúaccommodation,‚Äù of course, costs money, and as we already know, the only ‚Äúmoney‚Äù the Fed has to spend is the kind they create out of thin air‚Äì the very kind of money (and policy) which leads to the kind of inflation discussed above‚Äînamely, the brutal kind.

 As for that fake money, the evidence of the Fed‚Äôs desperate (and only) direction is now obvious, as the following M2 money supply makes equally clear. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v774ta55sw171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e73c839beb67a67eea9aed7de4ac61d86813840

 

Fed is so embarrassed by this ‚Äúprinting solution‚Äù that they‚Äôve stopped *weekly* reporting of M2 data, and frankly, since March, have even stopped *monthly* reporting of the same.

That, of course, is both telling as well as disgraceful‚Ä¶ The Fed literally has something to hide, and that never bodes well, does it?

&#x200B;

 The correlation to central bank balance sheet (i.e., money supply) expansion and rising markets is now beyond dispute. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sgizb6xcsw171.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=aad2fe681fe0c49ac20368aba77e86c118b22959

 In short‚Äîdo you see the correlation and pattern? Do you see how the Fed‚Äôs market sausage is made? More importantly, do you now see the Fed‚Äôs self-made conundrum? 

 

Given that the Fed bows to the markets not the people, which choice do you think they‚Äôll make?

In other words, expect more money printing and more yield curve control‚Äîand hence more money creation, more inflation, and by extension more fiat currency debasement.

 More money supply to keep rates monetized simply means more currency debasement and rising inflation.",nn51ou,"""Fed's ""Favorite"" #Inflation Indicator (PCE) Explodes At Fastest Rate Since 1992 As Incomes Crash By Record"""

7497,,2021-05-28 20:45:08,t3_nn76we,,wallstreetbets,"TLDR:

I have leading indicators telling me that there are two concurrent shifts underway when it comes to who is purchasing homes.

\- Massive increase in unmarried people buying houses alone. This used to be somewhat unusual, now it's becoming very common.

\- Massive increase in unmarried men, in particular, buying houses alone. Traditionally, the female-to-male ratio of unmarried homebuyers was about 5 to 1. For the last 3 months, it's been closer to 50/50.

Source is my own closed real estate purchase transactions. Am a mortgage broker (btw this means cash purchases are ""invisible"" to me). It takes 3-6 months for [HMDA data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Mortgage_Disclosure_Act) to become accessible to journalists and academics, and thus ""visible"" to the general public (assuming journalists deem it worthy of commenting on), but I can see the trends live in real time.

How would one go about placing a bet that in about 3 or 6 months, the media, journalists, academics, etc, will pick up on this, publish articles, and potentially cause a lot of people to buy certain stocks. Which stocks would that be? Is there a ""Mancave, Inc"" out there that would potentially get an uptick? Or maybe a company making smart-home stuff that is particularly suited to renting by the room (the single men are not buying 1 bedroom condos, they are buying proper houses with 3 bedrooms, etc)?

EDIT: oh, and to be clear. It's not just an uptick in single men. It's an uptick in women too, but a massive surge from the men. It used to be that for 15 banana sales, 10 are to married couples, 4 to single women, and 1 to a single man. Now for the same 15 banana sales, it's 6 to married couples, 6 to single women, and 3 to single men, something like that.",nn76we,Homebuyer Demographics Shift towards single and male. How to bet?

I have been doing research and talking to as many people I can that have some sort of experience/knowledge when dealing with the stock market. I heard about the potential to get into AMC and make some serious profit. I invested early on when shares were selling for around $8.00. I kept reading we need to hold until June 2nd and reevaluate. That‚Äôs my current plan, but hey I don‚Äôt know much about the game lol.

My current understanding of why there is a squeeze is because of previous events which backed hedge funds into a corner. Basically the hedge funds have had to borrow shares to pay off debt to companies like GME. When borrowing those shares, hedge fund companies left themselves vulnerable because they have no more money to borrow to pay off their debt. So if everyone buys stock in AMC and holds it, then the hedge fund companies are forced to pay out. The more people that buy and hold their shares then the higher the shares are worth and over time it will pay a profit. 

Like I said, I‚Äôm new to the game and this is just my current understanding of how the masses can manipulate the stock market. Please comment and enlighten me on another view point or correct my understanding. Let‚Äôs all get rich and work together with the power of knowledge!

You‚Äôre welcome to find my last DD post for verification. And for those of you who made tendies on it congratulations to you all! Spread the good energy!

As I am writing this post Today is 05/28/2021, I‚Äôll try to bring more data and technical analysis on $RKT, as you all saw what happened yesterday 05/27/2021 around lunch time upon sudden move it went from 17.50 area all the way to 19.40. This move doesn‚Äôt seem so random at all, a combination of someone noticed this to be a strategic technical squeeze just testing the water after it being suppressed down for the past 3 months, and you can see how fast the shorts started covering all of a sudden.

Today 05/28/2021, at opening it shot up to $19.20 but the shorts came prepared for $RKT this morning with their analysts and news blasting numerous articles and downgrades from Morgan Stanley, Wedbush & Zacks, ALL AT ONCE. This is certainly no coincidence.

On the technical side, on the daily chart as you can see it has a gap to fill around 22.67 area then it‚Äôll go straight to 28 and has a huge potential to pass beyond that and make it to a new all-time high, there‚Äôs nothing stopping it. On the daily MACD closed red and turned green, RSI is at the same level as last time before it squeezed to ATH $43, Parabolic S.A.R indicator flipped from red on the daily to green for the first time in 3 months. Another important factor is as you look at the volume and candle compared to last time it exploded (both red arrows) same volume, same price action.

Conclusion: the shorts are basically scared sh\*tless right now and they know it, is a tickle to the trigger for it to explode again like last time or even higher. Based on Excess Returns Model the fair value for RKT is $85, so why haven't we seen $100 yet?

2. AMC's recent rise in market value and share price increases have been largely driven by Reddit investors who the company says own over 80% of the company's over 480 million shares outstanding. We can expect the price to keep soaring as Reddit and other social media-based investors keep making the company's stock more and more popular on social media.
3. AMC stock will likely rise to $1 k due to the ongoing short squeeze to force short-sellers such as hedge funds to cover their losses. Short-sellers have already made millions of dollars in losses and as the short squeeze continues, share prices are expected to grow.
4. AMC stock is one of the most shorted stocks at the moment. The fact that the stock is shorted makes it more likely for share prices to keep increasing as short-sellers are forced to abandon their positions and cover losses.
5. AMC theaters are back in business after movie theater closures due to Covid regulations. The company's movie theaters are already selling out all their tickets, thereby attracting investors who see hope for the industry and expect profits to grow as the economy continues to reopen.
6. AMC's CEO Adam Aron is inspiring the Reddit investors to continue supporting the stock and become customers by going to its movie theaters. The CEO has gone ahead to increase his online activities on Twitter to engage the investors and listen to their concerns. The continuous appreciation of the online-based investors by the company's CEO will likely push the stock price higher in the coming days.

8. Big companies such as the Vanguard Group are currently buying AMC stock. The fact that big companies are willing to buy rather than sell the stock shows that they believe in a positive future for the company. These big companies encourage other institutional investors to buy the stock, thereby increasing stock prices.
9. Recent announcements by the Securities Exchange Commission that it is reviewing short-selling rules to properly protect small investors may also be a factor in contributing to further increases in AMC stock prices. If small investors know that the SEC will establish rules to protect them from the short positions adopted by hedge bets, then more small investors may be inclined to invest in AMC stock effectively increasing share prices.
10. Recent battles between small online-based investors such as those on Reddit and large hedge funds who mostly take on short positions (short-sellers) that result in job losses are also driving up and will keep driving up AMC stock. Online-based investors continue to develop a liking for shorted stocks in order to stick it up to big hedge funds. Besides, AMC is currently one of the most held stocks at the moment. This will keep driving up share prices.",nndrnf,It is just the beginning... üçø

Add up all the open interest for prices higher than the closing. Multiply X 100 for total shares.
Then divide by the weighted average of the deltas of those open interest strike prices to get a rough number of how many shares had to be bought for Hedging.

Then take out 50% because not all options are sold by market makers. Or pick your own %. 

(Then realize that MMs don't hedge in real time all the time. Oftentimes they buy shares the next day, it depends on the risk of their overall portfolio. But let's assume they did hedge today all day)

To be fair the ape tards did take most of the craze to their own subs so it's not as bad but there are also users on the other side talking out of their ass saying the squeeze is over and that gme is overvalued. However I look at the price today and it can't be true, yet they're on their high horse calling apes stupid. Again alot of those users barely have skin in the game yet they are loud as well. I think the answer is to enforce rules on the sub to keep everything related to options trades, no more shares. Make an exception for theta gang since they're still in options. What'll happen is all these small accounts will get wiped out and only those with the real gambling addictions will remain. Good shit either way, you changed my mind.",,

Do you understand what dilution is? Do you realize how it could potentially impact a company that doubles the number of share outstanding every time the stock market gets an influx of liquidity?

Using phrases like ""easy money"" when describing stocks that are less than a dollar per share is absurd, and a clear sign of somebody who is either trying to scam others, or currently getting scammed.

Add to that, when I posted this in February, later that day my Twitter was hacked by some IP in Russia, and then immediately linked to an Onlyfans account. I can only imagine their intent with that Onlyfans account was, or what it could've possibly had to do with this, but it doesn't take a mathematician to put two and two together.

Anyways, I'd love to see Sundial perform well, but it seems the company is shorting itself. Open up any database on current and historical options trades (I suggest Fidelity, they don't bullshit you with the Greeks so you'll have to find that elsewhere or just do it yourself, but they give you better historical data in a less nonsensical format than I've seen any else) along side the sec's SNDL filings and try to put them together. You'll see before any big announcement (usually of another shelf offering), a shit ton of ludicrously otm options are sold, then their a rise in price, and a return to the old trend towards zero.

You must have a committed a shit ton of money to the company, because you're acting like your life depends on their success. What does arguing with an ""internet rando"" get you here if you're so sure that I'm dependent on their failure? I have no position in the company whatsoever anyways.

I own no positions in the company, but I love arguing, and I love wasting time on a Friday night. What do you get out of this?",,

Everything looked to have gone off successfully. We are now waiting on the data and craft to be analysed and inspected. This will take a few weeks according to Michael Colglazier.
That being said he had already outlined the test schedule in the earnings zoom call.

1st test flight - may 
2nd crewed flight - June 
3rd flight with R Branson on board late June/July 

4th flight this will be taking the Italian airforce on a training mission (600k a seat) late July


On the run in to the first test flight some possible maintenance issues appeared with the carrier plane White knight 2‚Ä¶. 
This indeed could have gone either way , after 2 weeks inspections it was decided that WK2 did not need to delay testing no maintenance was needed at this point. Scheduled Maintenance will commence in the fall after all tests have been completed.
Upon this news it is my opinion that the testing programme will go ahead as planned.

The market has responded accordingly and the stock is now up from $17-‚Ç¨31

With all these catalysts lined up before the end of the year and commercial operations looming for early 2022 things are looking up for Virgin Galactic.The success of the last test flight the company have now proven tech and concept.

I had a look at $BB and assume that we finally formed the bottom. In the last few days we saw a sharp rise which might continue in the next weeks. If we can break the 12$ resistance, the next targets would be aroung 25-28$. 

Using Elliot wave theory we are probably at the end of the correction wave 4 and now began with the bullish wave 5.

Price targets:

\#1 12$

\#2 25$

\#3 48$

7817,,2021-05-28 09:17:32,t3_nmtt43,,wallstreetbets,"Trainline has taken a huge dip since the UK government's announcement of the plan to nationalise the railway network. The plan includes creating an online ticketing platform by Great British Railways which might have a huge blow on Trainline revenue. However, this platform does not yet exist and will probably take a couple of years to develop. Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed.

In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales.  Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%.

I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time  for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

7822,,2021-05-28 10:41:01,t3_nmuzzi,,wallstreetbets,"Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent of Modernas if not more. Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects) 

Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

Imagine if the spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize one piece to understand the whole picture it and helps modify your DNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates it can still recognize the virus. In contrast to using one portion of the picture as it mutates it's easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine, that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. Not only that but they have had the least amount of side effects of any covid vaccine deeming it the safest covid vaccine.... 

And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein (whole picture) and the safety profile. Also worth a mention is that you could store it in a regular refrigerator, and let it sit out in room temperature while you're vaccinating people instead of a special ultra low temp freeze needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers, this is a majority of the world. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines so other protein competitors will be far behind and they will have an a moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing they teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine. They will be combining flu and covid vaccine by 2025 for possibly double the price of current covid vaccine.

 They are pretty much de-risked at this point. Yes you could buy other  biotechs that can go up 20x but are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up) that has all successful trials done so far, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment to where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place there are no more glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""

They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. Yesterday at market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. 
 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

Future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract in there ( in the link below in another message). It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 

As far as my position I own some $200 July calls along with about 933 shares. I'm all in baby.  Been in since $4.06, I panicked and sold once during February a couple months during the mini bear market we had and got back in a bit too early so got a wash sale üôà but I'm diamond hands all the way to $800 from here.  LFG I expect to turn that into a cool million in a year's time via shares and options based on the DD provided. Just know this isn't all completely my DD some of this is taken from my good friends at the community Nvax community on Stocktwits. They're one of the most hardcore groups that provides excellent DD and are always willing to help each other a hand if anyone's got questions highly recommend to check it out. So my point is this is information collected over the months that is a group consensus on nvax future price. (Check out next link below this paragraph, it has My positions and an amazing DD chart converting contracts to future price and comparing with competitors. My screen name on stovktwits  is the same on there Johnnyknowsbest. Been on there and here since i started with nvax.

Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. This is huge as the combo is going to differentiate them especially since both flu and covid vaccines are first in class.

Vol Trigger: Increased to 419 (Important support and resistance level. (above this level = lower volatility and a more stable stock price.)

Abs Gamma Strike: Unchanged

Gamma Notional: Decreased to $-516 (stock has larger put gamma position. A negative gamma position implies higher volatility in the underlying)

Put Wall Support: Increased to 419 (If Put Wall shifts to a higher strike it could be a bearish indication)

Call Wall Strike: Increased to 425 (When this strike is rolled higher it is generally considered bullish)

Gamma Tilt: Decreased to 0.88	 (when decreasing it‚Äôs a bearish signal.)

Somebody posted this in the Rite Aid sub. Can one of the more astute people here comment on this? Is this a real possibility? 

The news that leaked that Amazon was interested in physical locations makes me wonder, but they‚Äôve had years to buy Rite Aid, CVS or Walgreens. So far they‚Äôve done nothing but Pillpack, which has been mostly a failure.

1) We look to the PTON CFO's statement found in the latest earnings call transcript, for guidance:
""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior.""
2) Being that we do not have access to a 10-K filing for Q4 fiscal '19, we will access other filings that do in fact reference numbers from fiscal '19...
A) 10-K filing dated 9/11/2020
B) 10-Q filing dated 5/6/2020
3) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $223.3M under Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19)
But, that is TOTAL Revenue; we need to find out what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike sales...
4) To calculate what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike Sales, we can use numbers from neighboring Q3 (i.e. Three Months Ended March 31, 2019)...
A) On page 6 of the 10-Q, you will find Revenue of ""Connected Fitness Products"" (aka Bike Sales) to be $261.6M
B) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $316.7M
C) % of Bike Sales per TOTAL Revenue: $261.6M / $316.7M * 100 = 82.6% {""Connected Fitness Products"" Revenue (aka Bike Sales)}
5) Apply 82.6% to the TOTAL Revenue $223.3M for Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19): $223.3M x 0.826 = $184.45M {Bike Sales for Q4 of fiscal '19}
6) Per the CFO, ""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior."":

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote... By mid-July, we‚Äôll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase precious metals  especially silver amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative 

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

Gold rose over 60% in the 1930s as the prices of stocks and real estate crashed. You could buy an entire block with a one ounce gold coin. Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms.

I must address Cramer's statement because he is obviously trying to add fuel to the short-selling fire: When he says ""we're not going natural gas"" he is clearly making a vague and general statement meant to be interpreted in the worst possible way: ""no one is going to buy or use natural gas."" By now, I hope everyone that is interested in this stock understands that CLNE offers an alternative transportation fuel, thus, the investments made by BP and Chevron, and not revolutionary technology like some EV's (but this is mostly hype meant to catapult EVs to the front. What most people do not realize is that driverless technology and such can be placed in Petro vehicles too). Also, unfortunately, the company has done a terrible marketting job. That's why powerful analysts can get away with making vague and unsupported statements. The fact that Cramer explained the stock's decrease over the last month as being due to widespread dissaproval is misleading, at best. Many people do not yet know about the cleanliness and therapeutic effects RNG has on the climate.

The News...

If you haven't read yet it looks like Federal Cannabis legalization my be around the corner. [Here](https://www.mpp.org/policy/federal/the-more-act/) is the House Bill. Supporters seem on board and like the reforms they have done to the bill including rescheduling cannabis. [Last time](https://mjbizdaily.com/key-us-house-lawmaker-reintroduces-federal-marijuana-legalization-bill/) the bill was introduced it cleared the House.   


Personally I think this gets a lot of support especially from a fiscal point of view. With stimulus stalling and a giant debate going on about how to pay for the stimulus I think cannabis offers the easiest way to collect federal revenue. A simple review of the bill and the fiscal benefits to the Fed's can be read [here](https://www.justtherealnews.com/congress/nadler-blumenauer-lee-jackson-lee-jeffries-velazquez-reintroduce-comprehensive-marijuana-reform-legislation/). The bill states a 5% fed tax. Money coming for uncle Sam, right when questions about paying for stimulus.... Personally I think it adds up, but that's for you to decide. 

Okay so that's the hype...

Let's talk about the tickers listed ($SNDL and $TLRY). 

$SNDL

I'll start with the cheaper YOLO, $SNDL. $SNDL short interest isn't high, but the company did issue convertible notes a while back around .7c if my memory is correct. I'm not saying they won't do it again, but they should be in a good place fiscally for now. Float is high with about 1.6B shares out there. However today's volume at the time of writing is over 415M. That's not bad given such a high float. It's about 200% more than the average volume. 

The options chain on $SNDL has me giddy. With over 200,000 options currently in the money on todays move above $1 there is some high potential here for some interesting action. The put to call ratio is just obnoxiously low at .08 it's screaming upwards betting. If we hold above $1 the potential squeeze up could be amazing.   


It's also broken up on the trend lines and out of the downward channel it was in. The regression channel from the peak squeeze back in Feb just broke out today according to my crayons I have laying around. 

$TLRY

$TLRY was the squeeze of a lifetime if you remember it back in 19'. The ticker was just a money printer with it's low float and stupid hype. Then they proceeded to do, like they all do, and issue debt. Shares tumbled since then falling from $120 --> $5. Ouch bag holders.   


Like all the cannabis stocks the Feb bump pushed $TLRY to above $60 in an amazing move. $TLRY has a lower short interest than $SNDL, but it also has a much lower float at about 300M. Compared to $SNDL the volume here isn't as good, but still remains decently above the avg volume around 36M as of right now. 

If we peep the options chain we also see a crazy low P/C ratio around .11. But we don't have the Open Interest in the chain like $SNDL does unless you roll out to Jun 18. Then we finally get some decent OI.   


Personally I am going with $SNDL. The option's chain looks better, the stock is cheaper, and the short interest is a little better. My advice would be to roll out till at least the Jun 11th $1 strike to not get eaten alive by Theta and IV crush. But WSB does what WSB wants and that's why I love you all.   
Do not go above the $2 strikes IMO. You will get crushed by theta unless we get an insane move, which could happen but I don't see the risk / reward there.",nn326f,MORE ACT / CANNABIS / $SNDL & $TLRY Potential

>A corner in the silver market has been tried before - and let's be clear, that is what is being attempted now.  In 1980, a rule change by the government destroyed the corner.  #silverthursday.

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday

>Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers‚Äô attempt to corner the market on the metal.

-
>Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926‚Äì2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers‚Äô Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.

-
>By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged‚ÄîMarch 27‚Äîsilver fell to $10.80, the metal‚Äôs biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, ‚ÄúA billion dollars isn‚Äôt what it used to be,‚Äù the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.

-
>To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978‚Äì91) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities.",nn36fw,There is no silver short squeeze happening.

* Geeta Gupta-Fisker is a solid Chief Financial Officer with experience in investment banking - she will ensure the shares are valued right
* Henrik has learned from all the mistakes he made with his previous attempt to create Fisker Automotive, and will certainly do everything in his power to avoid that mess again. He has designed systems into the intricacies of the company to avoid failure - meaning Fisker Inc is guaranteed to succeed

* 250,000+ units a year expected by 2025
* Partnerships with Foxconn and Magna Steyr, both giants in their respective industries, among others
* Large Fleet market in Europe gaining momentum, and 700+ Fisker reservations in this market alone
* 16,000+ reservations already. More than Tesla had 18 months pre-production
* Revenue streams include leasing automotives, servicing, selling emissions credits, selling insurance (like selling the pickaxe to miners, and selling the diamonds to the mine owners too, absolutely genius - Fisker are insuring cars which they own, because the customer is only leasing it)
* High short interest (20%+), high analyst price targets compared to current share price (100%+) and low valuation compared to peers ($3bn market cap currently)
* Designing the first ever all-electric popemobile - Massive, soon to be historic, event!
* I give $FSR (currently $13 a share) a price target of $100 by end of year 2022, if not sooner
* Price Targets: $35 by end of year - Previous ATH. $50 start of next year - European and Chinese debut of prototypes. $100 end of 2022 - start of production (SOP). $150+ 2023
* 2025 Price Targets, calculated using projected data: Bear case - $97 a share, Bull case - $519 a share
* Downside in the short term is capped by the large amount of cash on hand - one third of market cap is cash. Long term, is capped by risk factors, which are almost eligible and affect every automotive startup anyway.

## Fisker Automotive

In 2008, Fisker Automotive raised over $90 million from investors including venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. In September 2009, Fisker Automotive was awarded a $528 million loan guarantee by the United States Department of Energy (DOE). The automaker was one of four recipients of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, to encourage the domestic manufacture of electric cars. The funds were to be used to develop the Karma, as well as an affordable family-size plug-in hybrid car. The loan facility was frozen at $192 million in February 2012, after the DOE claimed that Fisker missed its milestones

In December 2011, just as the Fisker Karma was launched, its battery supplier, A123 Systems, recalled all batteries, followed by a second recall in 2012. A123 filed for bankruptcy in October 2012, leaving Fisker Automotive without a battery supplier. After selling approximately 2,000 units, production of the Fisker Karma was suspended in November 2012, in the absence of its battery supplier.

Henrik Fisker resigned as chairman from Fisker Automotive in March 2013, because of disagreements with management about business strategy. Later that year, the company declared voluntary bankruptcy.Fisker raised and spent more than a billion dollars over its lifetime.The heart of Fisker‚Äôs business model was in that early deal with Quantum. The idea was to design a gorgeous car, and have suppliers like Quantum provide the technology because off-the-shelf parts from suppliers would help keep costs down.

But there were problems with this strategy: Sometimes, those parts had to be custom-made to fit the design vision, which resulted in higher prices for Fisker. Other times, parts were delivered late or, worse, faulty, but Fisker was locked in to those supplier relationships. Sources close to Fisker have also said that many of the parts were owned by the suppliers themselves, so Fisker didn‚Äôt own a lot of the internal technology.

The broker that raised funds for Fisker automotive, by selling their private shares, was Advanced Equities.It wasn‚Äôt until December 2011 and into 2012 that the more dubious efforts of Advanced Equities became clearer to Fisker‚Äôs hundreds of investors. The last few hundred million dollars of Advanced Equities‚Äô fund raising for Fisker, starting with the D-1 round, was what brokers call ‚Äúpay to play.‚Äù As Fisker was running into technical, delivery and political problems, its valuation was quickly declining. But the company still needed more money, so the brokers went back to its current investors and said: Unless you give this more, your current shares will be diluted and your preferred stock will be converted to common stock.

It was essentially a gun to their heads. This is why investor Wray sued Fisker in February 2012, alleging he was on the receiving end of this tactic. In his lawsuit, he says Advanced Equities sent him a letter dated Jan. 18, 2012, stating that he needed to decide if he wanted to invest in Fisker‚Äôs next round, and pay around $84,000 by Jan. 27, 2012 ‚Äî a little over a week from receiving the letter. He also says that Advanced Equities assured him that he would have anti-dilution protection. According to the audio clip from Advanced Equities‚Äô internal sales call in early 2010, Advanced Equity leaders say that the Fisker deal will ‚Äúsuffer no dilution,‚Äù and was ‚Äúa dream scenario.‚Äù

That dream would soon end. In September 2012 after Fisker closed on $1.2 billion in funding, the bulk of it organized by Advanced Equities, the SEC charged the broker with misleading investors when it raised money for another company back in 2009 and 2010 (Bloom Energy). Advanced settled, agreeing to pay $1 million, and its co-founders were personally fined. Two months later Advanced Equities closed up shop.

Later, A123 Systems itself went bankrupt, causing more problems for Fisker. Fisker claimed that A123 Systems owed it $140 million, but a bankruptcy settlement reduced that to a paltry $15 million.

Then there was the just plain terrible luck for the ironically named Karma: Super Storm Sandy wiped out 338 of its Karmas in storage in New Jersey. The cars first drowned, and then caught on fire ‚Äî salt water damage caused a short circuit that was spread to other cars by high winds, Fisker said at the time.

With all of this happening in public ‚Äî and in a presidential election year ‚Äî Fisker‚Äôs struggles became highly politicized. The company was mentioned numerous times in presidential debates and speeches leading up to the election. Republican nominee Romney called Fisker and other DOE-supported companies losers.

The company didn‚Äôt seem to invest substantially in technology innovation or tech IP, and seemed to spend a disproportionate amount on suppliers. For example, numerous sources have said that the company paid upfront for 15,000 of some of the parts for its planned 15,000 Karmas. It ended up only selling around 2,000 of the cars. It has also been said that Fisker paid some funds upfront to have BMW make engines for the 100,000 Nina cars it hoped to produce ‚Äî in the end, Fisker didn‚Äôt deliver a single Nina.

Costs to build each Karma also creeped up because the company missed its volume targets, and because engineering had to change designs around supplier constraints. The company ended up adding $20,000 to its initial sale price.

Expensive hires may also have sucked away chunks of Fisker‚Äôs funding: Sources say that Fisker filled the upper levels of the company with seasoned auto executives from Detroit. At the high point of Fisker, the company had around 300 employees, plus dozens of contract staff. Bringing in a certain amount of the old guard could help a car startup ramp up quickly, and also impress potential investors with ‚Äúindustry names.‚Äù But those people are also used to big auto-industry budgets that included extensive travel and salaries ‚Äî that‚Äôs the opposite life of a tech startup.

## Fisker Inc.

In July 2016, Henrik Fisker expressed interest in designing a fully connected electric car with autonomous driving features and an aesthetically pleasing look. He has pursued battery technology, and hinted at potentially reviving the Fisker name with a pure-electric vehicle using technology that nobody else has. Since then Fisker has talked about delays to the promised solid state battery technology, which he does not expect to be able to be produced in volume until at least 2025. Posing risk for competition from more scientifically experienced future solid state battery producers such as Quantumscape.

***Forbes:*** ‚ÄúNow he‚Äôs back‚Äìand three things are different. First and foremost, he has a vital new partner: his wife, cofounder and Fisker Inc. CFO Geeta Gupta-Fisker. Second, his Los Angeles-based company is public this time around, raising more than $1 billion in an October 2020 IPO. And finally, Fisker‚Äôs stock price, up 56% since its debut, has made both Henrik and Geeta billionaires, each worth about $1.1 billion as of Friday‚Äôs market close. The auto industry has seen father-son and sibling leadership teams, but Fisker Inc.‚Äôs CEO-CFO combo is the fast-changing sector‚Äôs first husband and wife power couple.‚Äù

Wealth isn‚Äôt the purpose of the new company, Henrik says. ‚ÄúI never got into cars because of money. (This shows he is willing to do what is in the best interest of the company because he is not motivated by money, unlike 99% of other CEO‚Äôs)

The couple sought a big stake in the new venture to ensure they can control its fate in a way Fisker couldn‚Äôt with his earlier company.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yzhded6pfw171.png?width=408&format=png&auto=webp&s=54b30259720cf853a8efeacf058f2f74315260b9

Henrik is an auto industry celebrity, but Geeta‚Äôs background is equally impressive. A native of India, she holds multiple degrees in science, including a Ph.D. in biotechnology from Cambridge University where she was also a Research Newton Fellow. From there, she started a career in international investment for Lloyds Banking Group, and then managed investments for a high-net-worth client for several years. (In particular, this is insanely important - Geeta **KNOWS MONEY**! She knows how best to keep a company afloat, organize its share structure, provide value to shareholders, etc. because she has worked in the industry before. She may just be the most important element of Fisker Inc., due to the financial experience she has. At every step of the way, she is likely to make decisions with one sole focus - increasing share price and value).

She met her future husband in 2011 when he was visiting London, just before things started going very wrong at Fisker Automotive. They married in 2012.

‚ÄúWhen I left Fisker Automotive, all I had was my car,‚Äù Henrik remembers. ‚ÄúI'm in a different position, mainly because of Geeta. Because she cuts the deals.‚Äù

To get the new venture off the ground, the Fiskers invested the majority of their life savings‚Äìan enormous financial risk given the fate of Henrik‚Äôs prior company. Then, just as they were locking in plans for the IPO back in July, they were hit by a highly unwelcome complication: Geeta learned she had early-stage breast cancer.

‚ÄúShe got the call (from her doctor) during a call with investors,‚Äù Henrik says. Despite that bombshell, she continued working with banks and investors in the weeks that followed, even as she underwent two surgical procedures and radiation therapy. Her medical therapy concluded in November.

Henrik, who marvels at her fortitude throughout the health crisis says, ‚Äúshe only missed something like one day of work...That's just how she is. She works tirelessly.‚Äù

## Fisker Ocean

The Fisker Ocean will have a nearly 300-mile range with an 80 kWh battery and a solar panel roof as a range extender, adding approximately 1,000 free miles of range per year. Advanced electronics will be housed under the hood, and the vehicle will incorporate recycled and sustainable materials throughout. Deliveries of the Ocean are scheduled to begin in 2022.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s87j6bdsfw171.png?width=438&format=png&auto=webp&s=e40add9ce53319d31db242cce73a303afb03cbab

Fisker has also announced a partnership with Electrify America to ensure Fisker Ocean vehicles will integrate seamlessly with Electrify America charging stations when the e-SUV hits the market. With features such as a solar roof and recycled inner materials, it will be, according to Fisker Inc., the ""world's most sustainable vehicle.""

In 2017, Fisker Inc. announced that it had filed patents on flexible solid-state battery designs. Fisker expected the batteries to be produced on a mass scale around 2020. A prototype of the battery debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018. In October 2018, Fisker announced new funding for battery development through Caterpillar Venture Capital. The solid-state batteries are intended to deliver longer vehicle range and faster charging times.

In 2018, Fisker was named to the board of directors of First Cobalt, a North American cobalt refinery that produces battery materials.

In September 2019, it was announced that Fisker Inc. was partnering with Game of Thrones actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who will serve as a partner and sustainability adviser to Fisker, to work on advanced, affordable, electric mobility models.

&#x200B;

[In addition to being a well-known actor, Coster-Waldau is also the United Nations Development Program Goodwill Ambassador for climate change and other social issues.](https://preview.redd.it/3hssff5vfw171.png?width=451&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebe55e2468c5b63d1bc0ac3c71547219dff5afaa)

Nikolaj wrote this piece about Fisker:

To quote a friend of mine who is a lot smarter than me, architect Bjarke Ingels: ‚ÄúThe idea that sustainability needs to sacrifice quality of life is a flawed one. It‚Äôs a design challenge, a challenge to build something that transforms the idea of sustainability into something that will increase the quality of life for all those around it.‚Äù

One person meeting that challenge is Henrik Fisker, who has designed some of the most iconic cars over the past decades for BMW and others, like the BMW Z8, Aston Martin DB9 and Aston Martin V8 Vantage. He‚Äôs a hero for gas-guzzling supercars. He is a fellow Dane, I am a fan, and we met, of all places, on Twitter.

When we met in person, he described his new project ‚Äî an all-electric luxury SUV ‚Äî and asked me if I would help spread the word on his car. The problem as I see it with most electric cars is that they only accomplish the basics. They get you from point A to B. They run electric so you don‚Äôt pollute while driving, but that‚Äôs it. They are basically unattractive combustion engine cars that have a battery thrown into them ‚Äî and for most of them, a battery with a limited range. What Fisker does is to try to make every part of the car in a sustainable and attractive way, like a full-length solar roof, recycled floor mats and vegan leather seats. It looks incredibly cool and inviting, with a great 250- to 300-mile range, and at a cost of just under $40,000, it‚Äôs a luxury car affordable to a mass market.

I said yes and even became an investor, not only because it‚Äôs a great car but more importantly, I hope and believe it can inspire other companies to actively incorporate sustainability goals into all aspects of their business. Fisker then had the idea of calling me ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù adviser. Which I am not. Just to be clear. Thanks Henrik, sounds cool, but I am an actor and a citizen, and that‚Äôs really it.

And what about Hollywood? Is our industry changing, are we at the forefront? Looking at social media, you would think so. And things are happening, but usually only when a camera is pointed at people. Remember a few years back when all awards shows only used EVs for the red carpet? We made a difference. We mattered. We showed the way. So cool. So green, so ‚Ä¶ brief. Now it‚Äôs back to the Escalade. But hey, we are not using plastic straws anymore!

To believe that change will come from Hollywood is not really based in reality (when did that stop us?), but we are great at reacting ‚Äî and things around us are changing, and changing us. I have a good friend who loves his SUV. It‚Äôs not electric. But he cannot give up his car. He is a good guy, he‚Äôs works for the U.N., so if he has a problem going electric, we all do. But if he is presented with an alternative that doesn‚Äôt mean a reduction in his quality of life, something like the Fisker SUV, I think he‚Äôd transition to electric in a heartbeat.

The IPO deal values Fisker Inc at US$2.9 billion, with an IPO share price of $10.

On July 30, 2020, Fisker announced plans for a four-vehicle portfolio by 2025. The Fisker Ocean SUV will be joined by a sports sedan based on their previously announced Fisker Emotion concept, a coupe-like SUV, and a lifestyle pickup truck. All will be electric vehicles.

On October 15, 2020, Fisker Inc announced it would be outsourcing vehicle production of its Fisker Ocean electric SUV to Magna Steyr, to reduce the complexities and costs related to the building and operating its own factory. Magna will start building the Fisker Ocean in Europe in 2022.

## Henrik Fisker Interview quotes:

I have people on Twitter saying, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just make the car next month? You have a prototype.‚Äù Most people don‚Äôt understand that it takes 18 months to do long-lead body tooling for high-volume vehicles. Most people don‚Äôt understand it takes two years to do durability tests and do all the engineering certification and everything else.

And on the business model itself, I believe that there is nobody in the near future or the next couple of years that‚Äôs going to make a million EVs on one model. Today, there‚Äôs nobody doing it. Tesla probably has the highest volume of one single model, a couple hundred thousand. But even the big giant established carmakers are not making, right now, a couple hundred thousand vehicles of one model. So the way you get volume, in my view, is if you partner up with other OEMs and share some of the expensive parts of the platform, which in my view is not anymore something that is unique IP or something that is a unique experience to the customer. An aluminum stamped floor or a steel stamped floor really doesn‚Äôt have any brand value anymore.

And obviously, as we move forward, we always start to do some of the things ourselves. But it was really about de-risking in our first vehicle to market. So we‚Äôre going to do another three vehicles, which we can do because we don‚Äôt have to spend all our money and effort on learning how to manufacture a car, for instance.

So we have programmed a lot. We have hired a head of ESG, environmental and social governance, and he is really spearheading developing specific... we kind of put out some goals that we would like to reach with suppliers, and we at least try to bring them in that direction. They are not reaching those goals right now, but they may reach them later. And then we have goals for ourselves. So for instance, we look at transport. Are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs closer to the plant, or are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs on the other side of the planet that way we have to then transport all that stuff. So those are the types of things that we‚Äôre really thinking about now as we‚Äôre nominating suppliers. And finally, materials as well, looking at sustainable materials. We‚Äôve actually picked up a lot of knowledge on that side as well, where we are adding more sustainable materials to our vehicle. So we are actually looking across everything ‚Äî supply chain, where the suppliers are located, what the suppliers are doing for sustainability, and also then of course in the vehicle itself ‚Äî in terms of the type of materials there.

So - let's summarize - prices are rising at their fastest pace in almost 30 years and incomes just plunged by their most ever! We're gonna need more stimmies!""  

Plus  to above; 

Last year, Hirschman Capital noted that since 1821, 98% of sovereigns that hit 130% debt/GDP have defaulted on their sovereign debt.   

The US hit 130% late last year. 

Simple Conclussion : The Fed can‚Äôt go ‚Äúhawkish‚Äù and raise rates without sending markets ‚Äìand economies‚Äìto their knees; by extension, they now have nothing left to ‚Äúcut‚Äù when the current everything bubble implodes.

And that  is a *real problem*.

 There are only two ways for sovereigns to default: 

Inflation or collapse.    

The latter is not an option. 

 As for a solution, what‚Äôs so tragic is that the only option before the Fed is an even bigger problem‚Äîcurrent and inevitably more inflation. 

 That is, if the Fed wants to keep markets (and their job security) breathing, they no longer have the foregoing template of ‚Äúrate-hike-followed-by-rate-cutting‚Äù at their disposal, which means they now have no choice but to dovishly keep rates near the zero-bound indefinitely.

But the only way to keep rates ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù and nailed to the floor of time is to purchase otherwise unwanted bonds to keep their prices elevated and hence yields and rates repressed.

Such bond ‚Äúaccommodation,‚Äù of course, costs money, and as we already know, the only ‚Äúmoney‚Äù the Fed has to spend is the kind they create out of thin air‚Äì the very kind of money (and policy) which leads to the kind of inflation discussed above‚Äînamely, the brutal kind.

 As for that fake money, the evidence of the Fed‚Äôs desperate (and only) direction is now obvious, as the following M2 money supply makes equally clear. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v774ta55sw171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e73c839beb67a67eea9aed7de4ac61d86813840

 

Fed is so embarrassed by this ‚Äúprinting solution‚Äù that they‚Äôve stopped *weekly* reporting of M2 data, and frankly, since March, have even stopped *monthly* reporting of the same.

That, of course, is both telling as well as disgraceful‚Ä¶ The Fed literally has something to hide, and that never bodes well, does it?

&#x200B;

 The correlation to central bank balance sheet (i.e., money supply) expansion and rising markets is now beyond dispute. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sgizb6xcsw171.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=aad2fe681fe0c49ac20368aba77e86c118b22959

 In short‚Äîdo you see the correlation and pattern? Do you see how the Fed‚Äôs market sausage is made? More importantly, do you now see the Fed‚Äôs self-made conundrum? 

 

Given that the Fed bows to the markets not the people, which choice do you think they‚Äôll make?

In other words, expect more money printing and more yield curve control‚Äîand hence more money creation, more inflation, and by extension more fiat currency debasement.

 More money supply to keep rates monetized simply means more currency debasement and rising inflation.",nn51ou,"""Fed's ""Favorite"" #Inflation Indicator (PCE) Explodes At Fastest Rate Since 1992 As Incomes Crash By Record"""

7861,,2021-05-28 20:45:08,t3_nn76we,,wallstreetbets,"TLDR:

I have leading indicators telling me that there are two concurrent shifts underway when it comes to who is purchasing homes.

\- Massive increase in unmarried people buying houses alone. This used to be somewhat unusual, now it's becoming very common.

\- Massive increase in unmarried men, in particular, buying houses alone. Traditionally, the female-to-male ratio of unmarried homebuyers was about 5 to 1. For the last 3 months, it's been closer to 50/50.

Source is my own closed real estate purchase transactions. Am a mortgage broker (btw this means cash purchases are ""invisible"" to me). It takes 3-6 months for [HMDA data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Mortgage_Disclosure_Act) to become accessible to journalists and academics, and thus ""visible"" to the general public (assuming journalists deem it worthy of commenting on), but I can see the trends live in real time.

How would one go about placing a bet that in about 3 or 6 months, the media, journalists, academics, etc, will pick up on this, publish articles, and potentially cause a lot of people to buy certain stocks. Which stocks would that be? Is there a ""Mancave, Inc"" out there that would potentially get an uptick? Or maybe a company making smart-home stuff that is particularly suited to renting by the room (the single men are not buying 1 bedroom condos, they are buying proper houses with 3 bedrooms, etc)?

EDIT: oh, and to be clear. It's not just an uptick in single men. It's an uptick in women too, but a massive surge from the men. It used to be that for 15 banana sales, 10 are to married couples, 4 to single women, and 1 to a single man. Now for the same 15 banana sales, it's 6 to married couples, 6 to single women, and 3 to single men, something like that.",nn76we,Homebuyer Demographics Shift towards single and male. How to bet?

Note this was the retard‚Äôs first option trade so he was going bananas seeing all the fucking ü§ë tendies. The retard was bullish and let the stock run until it got smack down. Instead of rolling the calls and taking a profit he was hopeful and waiting for the stock to bounce back up.

If the shares are counted by votes which is supposed to happen on 6/2/21, then all the Hedgefunds have to do is not vote, right? How does share voting/count work? 

How will they prove that synthetic shares exist if not many people participate in the count? Is it mandatory?

7874,,2021-05-29 00:24:44,t3_nnbgwu,,wallstreetbets,"Like many of you guys on here, I initially missed out on the GameStop (GME) squeeze. Since the original hype of GME died down, I decided to play around with the stock market so I wouldn‚Äôt miss out on the next opportunity to make some money. 

I have been doing research and talking to as many people I can that have some sort of experience/knowledge when dealing with the stock market. I heard about the potential to get into AMC and make some serious profit. I invested early on when shares were selling for around $8.00. I kept reading we need to hold until June 2nd and reevaluate. That‚Äôs my current plan, but hey I don‚Äôt know much about the game lol.

My current understanding of why there is a squeeze is because of previous events which backed hedge funds into a corner. Basically the hedge funds have had to borrow shares to pay off debt to companies like GME. When borrowing those shares, hedge fund companies left themselves vulnerable because they have no more money to borrow to pay off their debt. So if everyone buys stock in AMC and holds it, then the hedge fund companies are forced to pay out. The more people that buy and hold their shares then the higher the shares are worth and over time it will pay a profit. 

Like I said, I‚Äôm new to the game and this is just my current understanding of how the masses can manipulate the stock market. Please comment and enlighten me on another view point or correct my understanding. Let‚Äôs all get rich and work together with the power of knowledge!

It was on a Thursday night 02/25/2021 when I posted, at the time RKT was around 19-20 range and on the following Monday 03/01/2021 it started rallying, by 03/02 & 03/03 it hit the ATH level 43. You‚Äôre welcome to find my last DD post for verification. And for those of you who made tendies on it congratulations to you all! Spread the good energy!

As I am writing this post Today is 05/28/2021, I‚Äôll try to bring more data and technical analysis on $RKT, as you all saw what happened yesterday 05/27/2021 around lunch time upon sudden move it went from 17.50 area all the way to 19.40. This move doesn‚Äôt seem so random at all, a combination of someone noticed this to be a strategic technical squeeze just testing the water after it being suppressed down for the past 3 months, and you can see how fast the shorts started covering all of a sudden.

Today 05/28/2021, at opening it shot up to $19.20 but the shorts came prepared for $RKT this morning with their analysts and news blasting numerous articles and downgrades from Morgan Stanley, Wedbush & Zacks, ALL AT ONCE. This is certainly no coincidence.

On the technical side, on the daily chart as you can see it has a gap to fill around 22.67 area then it‚Äôll go straight to 28 and has a huge potential to pass beyond that and make it to a new all-time high, there‚Äôs nothing stopping it. On the daily MACD closed red and turned green, RSI is at the same level as last time before it squeezed to ATH $43, Parabolic S.A.R indicator flipped from red on the daily to green for the first time in 3 months. Another important factor is as you look at the volume and candle compared to last time it exploded (both red arrows) same volume, same price action.

Conclusion: the shorts are basically scared sh\*tless right now and they know it, is a tickle to the trigger for it to explode again like last time or even higher. Based on Excess Returns Model the fair value for RKT is $85, so why haven't we seen $100 yet?

7885,,2021-05-29 02:43:46,t3_nndrnf,,wallstreetbets,"AMC price will soar because:
1. AMC is officially off the bankruptcy zone, thanks to the over $2 billion equity and debt capital the company currently has. The capital can last the company for the foreseeable future. Therefore, the risk of bankruptcy makes investors confident. This will likely further drive up stock prices as more investors buy the stock.
2. AMC's recent rise in market value and share price increases have been largely driven by Reddit investors who the company says own over 80% of the company's over 480 million shares outstanding. We can expect the price to keep soaring as Reddit and other social media-based investors keep making the company's stock more and more popular on social media.
3. AMC stock will likely rise to $1 k due to the ongoing short squeeze to force short-sellers such as hedge funds to cover their losses. Short-sellers have already made millions of dollars in losses and as the short squeeze continues, share prices are expected to grow.
4. AMC stock is one of the most shorted stocks at the moment. The fact that the stock is shorted makes it more likely for share prices to keep increasing as short-sellers are forced to abandon their positions and cover losses.
5. AMC theaters are back in business after movie theater closures due to Covid regulations. The company's movie theaters are already selling out all their tickets, thereby attracting investors who see hope for the industry and expect profits to grow as the economy continues to reopen.
6. AMC's CEO Adam Aron is inspiring the Reddit investors to continue supporting the stock and become customers by going to its movie theaters. The CEO has gone ahead to increase his online activities on Twitter to engage the investors and listen to their concerns. The continuous appreciation of the online-based investors by the company's CEO will likely push the stock price higher in the coming days.

8. Big companies such as the Vanguard Group are currently buying AMC stock. The fact that big companies are willing to buy rather than sell the stock shows that they believe in a positive future for the company. These big companies encourage other institutional investors to buy the stock, thereby increasing stock prices.
9. Recent announcements by the Securities Exchange Commission that it is reviewing short-selling rules to properly protect small investors may also be a factor in contributing to further increases in AMC stock prices. If small investors know that the SEC will establish rules to protect them from the short positions adopted by hedge bets, then more small investors may be inclined to invest in AMC stock effectively increasing share prices.
10. Recent battles between small online-based investors such as those on Reddit and large hedge funds who mostly take on short positions (short-sellers) that result in job losses are also driving up and will keep driving up AMC stock. Online-based investors continue to develop a liking for shorted stocks in order to stick it up to big hedge funds. Besides, AMC is currently one of the most held stocks at the moment. This will keep driving up share prices.",nndrnf,It is just the beginning... üçø

People tend to resort to alternative measures of currencies for protection against instability/inflation.  I honestly wish we had more charted history for cryptos to compare the 2008 recession for stocks, precious metals and crypto. I am curious to see how cryptos respond.

&#x200B;

. . . and yes 2022 very likely. I pray I am wrong. 

&#x200B;

JUST MY TWO CENTS.. This is not financial advice or anything of the nature. Just an APE's analysis.

Lumber prices higher, meaning cost to build higher, meaning higher housing prices, meaning people assuming more debt for the same home. I am seeing lenders being more tolerable to risk, and allowing these people that would be able to afford a 300k home borrow for a 450k home. This would remain stable if the work remains stable.

The issue: I am seeing people that are holding jobs that are rather temporary (Contract Labor) in the industrial arena. These same people that have been on these long term projects that are wrapping up. There does not seem to be more work following these projects in terms of work to continue gainful employment for these people in the same manner as it was. I am also seeing another side of the arena in regards to the oil fields and these workers. The new EO from our current administration has halted a lot of the mom-and-pop outfits that were employing these workers in the oil fields. Again, I do not see much flexibility in this work reopening. I am also seeing the religious congregations trying to lend a hand to the point of handing out free food boxes to help these families struggling.

Now I am not speaking ill things about any of these unlucky souls, but they do not have much of an education as means to finding better employment. I was one of the crowd at one point being I obtained a degree for a job that no longer existed in abundance. A majority of the same unfortunate ones do not have a great accumulation of savings from their income to be able say they will be able to effectively re-education process in a new field. REASON being they spent it on new vehicles, new houses, etc. I mean who can blame them - we all enjoy the better things in life where we can. Who honestly enjoys working on an older vehicle that is deeming itself as being unreliable due to use? Who honestly enjoys paying more for rent/lease than what a mortgage payment is?  Who honestly can say they do not like to have nice shirts, shoes, pants, etc to look nice? 

The only issue is when they assumed this debt and purchased these nice things - they assumed their income would remain stable. WELL . . . IT DOES NOT LOOK PROMISING - to say the least.  One can say they will unload the debt by selling their vehicles and houses - but what happens when they cannot unload the debt completely due to depreciation will create a snowballing effect.

I do think we will see a uptick in stocks as well in real estate arena. This is thanks to the increased revenues and asset values. I do think we will see a uptick in brick-and-mortar retail thanks to reopening. BUT I am questioning what will be the end result of this bubble effect. We all know what goes up - MUST COME DOWN. The question is when...

The OP raised the flag on inflation. Well the Fed operates on the assumption to counter inflation they must raise interest rates and reverse repos. I believe they reconvene in July? The government has a similar approach measure when it comes to Taxes. Which is already in discussion. The banks were ""begging"" for countermeasures to inflation. so - how will the fed and DC implement countermeasures?

I foresee a tax hike along with higher interest rates. When the Corporations and business with the money  to spend get charged more to proceed (Taxes and Interest,) they tend to hesitate and take their plans elsewhere, i.e. other countries/states. UNLESS it is subsidized with tax breaks and ""free"" money..

Which is in talks in DC now for infrastructure spending, etc... I pray it succeeds. This would put the labor force I mentioned prior back with means of gainful employment. BUT when have we known DC to act rationally in recent time. There is no guarantee they will be able to recover.

\*\*\*\*\*

I have included some links for verification to this thought and for others to start their due diligence. I am still trying to find the report from one of the various government entities I found with the 3.4 million people at least 30 days past due on their mortgage.

Everything looked to have gone off successfully. We are now waiting on the data and craft to be analysed and inspected. This will take a few weeks according to Michael Colglazier.
That being said he had already outlined the test schedule in the earnings zoom call.

1st test flight - may 
2nd crewed flight - June 
3rd flight with R Branson on board late June/July 

4th flight this will be taking the Italian airforce on a training mission (600k a seat) late July


On the run in to the first test flight some possible maintenance issues appeared with the carrier plane White knight 2‚Ä¶. 
This indeed could have gone either way , after 2 weeks inspections it was decided that WK2 did not need to delay testing no maintenance was needed at this point. Scheduled Maintenance will commence in the fall after all tests have been completed.
Upon this news it is my opinion that the testing programme will go ahead as planned.

The market has responded accordingly and the stock is now up from $17-‚Ç¨31

With all these catalysts lined up before the end of the year and commercial operations looming for early 2022 things are looking up for Virgin Galactic.The success of the last test flight the company have now proven tech and concept. 
Also with revenue now coming in Nasa who are conducting micro gravity analysis.
Also international training for military pilots and astronauts.

I had a look at $BB and assume that we finally formed the bottom. In the last few days we saw a sharp rise which might continue in the next weeks. If we can break the 12$ resistance, the next targets would be aroung 25-28$. 

Using Elliot wave theory we are probably at the end of the correction wave 4 and now began with the bullish wave 5.

Price targets:

\#1 12$

\#2 25$

\#3 48$

8044,,2021-05-28 09:17:32,t3_nmtt43,,wallstreetbets,"Trainline has taken a huge dip since the UK government's announcement of the plan to nationalise the railway network. The plan includes creating an online ticketing platform by Great British Railways which might have a huge blow on Trainline revenue. However, this platform does not yet exist and will probably take a couple of years to develop. Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed.

In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales.  Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%.

I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time  for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

8049,,2021-05-28 10:41:01,t3_nmuzzi,,wallstreetbets,"Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent of Modernas if not more. Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects) 

Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

Imagine if the spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize one piece to understand the whole picture it and helps modify your DNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates it can still recognize the virus. In contrast to using one portion of the picture as it mutates it's easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine, that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. Not only that but they have had the least amount of side effects of any covid vaccine deeming it the safest covid vaccine.... 

And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein (whole picture) and the safety profile. Also worth a mention is that you could store it in a regular refrigerator, and let it sit out in room temperature while you're vaccinating people instead of a special ultra low temp freeze needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers, this is a majority of the world. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines so other protein competitors will be far behind and they will have an a moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing they teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine. They will be combining flu and covid vaccine by 2025 for possibly double the price of current covid vaccine.

 They are pretty much de-risked at this point. Yes you could buy other  biotechs that can go up 20x but are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up) that has all successful trials done so far, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment to where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place there are no more glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""

They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. Yesterday at market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. 
 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

Future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract in there ( in the link below in another message). It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 

As far as my position I own some $200 July calls along with about 933 shares. I'm all in baby.  Been in since $4.06, I panicked and sold once during February a couple months during the mini bear market we had and got back in a bit too early so got a wash sale üôà but I'm diamond hands all the way to $800 from here.  LFG I expect to turn that into a cool million in a year's time via shares and options based on the DD provided. Just know this isn't all completely my DD some of this is taken from my good friends at the community Nvax community on Stocktwits. They're one of the most hardcore groups that provides excellent DD and are always willing to help each other a hand if anyone's got questions highly recommend to check it out. So my point is this is information collected over the months that is a group consensus on nvax future price. (Check out next link below this paragraph, it has My positions and an amazing DD chart converting contracts to future price and comparing with competitors. My screen name on stovktwits  is the same on there Johnnyknowsbest. Been on there and here since i started with nvax.

Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. This is huge as the combo is going to differentiate them especially since both flu and covid vaccines are first in class.

# SPY SG:

Looks like low volatility day. Play tight.

Note from SG: ""For todays expiration our models show about 15% SPX /30% SPY gamma expiring, which could allow volatility increase a bit into next week. This in turn may free markets for a push up into that 4250 target (Call Wall) area.""

Gamma Index: decreased to -0.1 (A large negative figure indicates volatility may be high. The range is from 4 to ‚Äì4.)

Vol Trigger: Increased to 419 (Important support and resistance level. (above this level = lower volatility and a more stable stock price.)

Abs Gamma Strike: Unchanged

Gamma Notional: Decreased to $-516 (stock has larger put gamma position. A negative gamma position implies higher volatility in the underlying)

Put Wall Support: Increased to 419 (If Put Wall shifts to a higher strike it could be a bearish indication)

Call Wall Strike: Increased to 425 (When this strike is rolled higher it is generally considered bullish)

Gamma Tilt: Decreased to 0.88	 (when decreasing it‚Äôs a bearish signal.)

Net Delta: Increased to 198k (positive delta position infers options market makers have a net long hedge.)

25d risk reversal: Increased to -0.06 (When the ratio shifts towards 0 it indicates call demand)

Topp Abs Gamma Strikes: 	\[420, 419, 418, 415\]

1) We look to the PTON CFO's statement found in the latest earnings call transcript, for guidance:
""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior.""
2) Being that we do not have access to a 10-K filing for Q4 fiscal '19, we will access other filings that do in fact reference numbers from fiscal '19...
A) 10-K filing dated 9/11/2020
B) 10-Q filing dated 5/6/2020
3) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $223.3M under Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19)
But, that is TOTAL Revenue; we need to find out what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike sales...
4) To calculate what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike Sales, we can use numbers from neighboring Q3 (i.e. Three Months Ended March 31, 2019)...
A) On page 6 of the 10-Q, you will find Revenue of ""Connected Fitness Products"" (aka Bike Sales) to be $261.6M
B) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $316.7M
C) % of Bike Sales per TOTAL Revenue: $261.6M / $316.7M * 100 = 82.6% {""Connected Fitness Products"" Revenue (aka Bike Sales)}
5) Apply 82.6% to the TOTAL Revenue $223.3M for Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19): $223.3M x 0.826 = $184.45M {Bike Sales for Q4 of fiscal '19}
6) Per the CFO, ""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior."":

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote... By mid-July, we‚Äôll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase precious metals  especially silver amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative 

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

Gold rose over 60% in the 1930s as the prices of stocks and real estate crashed. You could buy an entire block with a one ounce gold coin. Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms.

I must address Cramer's statement because he is obviously trying to add fuel to the short-selling fire: When he says ""we're not going natural gas"" he is clearly making a vague and general statement meant to be interpreted in the worst possible way: ""no one is going to buy or use natural gas."" By now, I hope everyone that is interested in this stock understands that CLNE offers an alternative transportation fuel, thus, the investments made by BP and Chevron, and not revolutionary technology like some EV's (but this is mostly hype meant to catapult EVs to the front. What most people do not realize is that driverless technology and such can be placed in Petro vehicles too). Also, unfortunately, the company has done a terrible marketting job. That's why powerful analysts can get away with making vague and unsupported statements. The fact that Cramer explained the stock's decrease over the last month as being due to widespread dissaproval is misleading, at best. Many people do not yet know about the cleanliness and therapeutic effects RNG has on the climate.

The News...

If you haven't read yet it looks like Federal Cannabis legalization my be around the corner. [Here](https://www.mpp.org/policy/federal/the-more-act/) is the House Bill. Supporters seem on board and like the reforms they have done to the bill including rescheduling cannabis. [Last time](https://mjbizdaily.com/key-us-house-lawmaker-reintroduces-federal-marijuana-legalization-bill/) the bill was introduced it cleared the House.   


Personally I think this gets a lot of support especially from a fiscal point of view. With stimulus stalling and a giant debate going on about how to pay for the stimulus I think cannabis offers the easiest way to collect federal revenue. A simple review of the bill and the fiscal benefits to the Fed's can be read [here](https://www.justtherealnews.com/congress/nadler-blumenauer-lee-jackson-lee-jeffries-velazquez-reintroduce-comprehensive-marijuana-reform-legislation/). The bill states a 5% fed tax. Money coming for uncle Sam, right when questions about paying for stimulus.... Personally I think it adds up, but that's for you to decide. 

Okay so that's the hype...

Let's talk about the tickers listed ($SNDL and $TLRY). 

$SNDL

I'll start with the cheaper YOLO, $SNDL. $SNDL short interest isn't high, but the company did issue convertible notes a while back around .7c if my memory is correct. I'm not saying they won't do it again, but they should be in a good place fiscally for now. Float is high with about 1.6B shares out there. However today's volume at the time of writing is over 415M. That's not bad given such a high float. It's about 200% more than the average volume. 

The options chain on $SNDL has me giddy. With over 200,000 options currently in the money on todays move above $1 there is some high potential here for some interesting action. The put to call ratio is just obnoxiously low at .08 it's screaming upwards betting. If we hold above $1 the potential squeeze up could be amazing.   


It's also broken up on the trend lines and out of the downward channel it was in. The regression channel from the peak squeeze back in Feb just broke out today according to my crayons I have laying around. 

$TLRY

$TLRY was the squeeze of a lifetime if you remember it back in 19'. The ticker was just a money printer with it's low float and stupid hype. Then they proceeded to do, like they all do, and issue debt. Shares tumbled since then falling from $120 --> $5. Ouch bag holders.   


Like all the cannabis stocks the Feb bump pushed $TLRY to above $60 in an amazing move. $TLRY has a lower short interest than $SNDL, but it also has a much lower float at about 300M. Compared to $SNDL the volume here isn't as good, but still remains decently above the avg volume around 36M as of right now. 

If we peep the options chain we also see a crazy low P/C ratio around .11. But we don't have the Open Interest in the chain like $SNDL does unless you roll out to Jun 18. Then we finally get some decent OI.   


Personally I am going with $SNDL. The option's chain looks better, the stock is cheaper, and the short interest is a little better. My advice would be to roll out till at least the Jun 11th $1 strike to not get eaten alive by Theta and IV crush. But WSB does what WSB wants and that's why I love you all.   
Do not go above the $2 strikes IMO. You will get crushed by theta unless we get an insane move, which could happen but I don't see the risk / reward there.",nn326f,MORE ACT / CANNABIS / $SNDL & $TLRY Potential

>A corner in the silver market has been tried before - and let's be clear, that is what is being attempted now.  In 1980, a rule change by the government destroyed the corner.  #silverthursday.

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday

>Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers‚Äô attempt to corner the market on the metal.

-
>Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926‚Äì2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers‚Äô Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.

-
>By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged‚ÄîMarch 27‚Äîsilver fell to $10.80, the metal‚Äôs biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, ‚ÄúA billion dollars isn‚Äôt what it used to be,‚Äù the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.

-
>To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978‚Äì91) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities.",nn36fw,There is no silver short squeeze happening.

In 2007, Tesla Motors hired Henrik Fisker to perform initial design work on the Tesla Model S electric sedan, which was introduced in 2012.

Fisker stated in 2018 that, with the growth of car-sharing, ride-hailing, and autonomous shuttles, he believes within 10 years private cars will be used for less than half of what they are currently used for.

&#x200B;

## Fisker Automotive

In 2008, Fisker Automotive raised over $90 million from investors including venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. In September 2009, Fisker Automotive was awarded a $528 million loan guarantee by the United States Department of Energy (DOE). The automaker was one of four recipients of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, to encourage the domestic manufacture of electric cars. The funds were to be used to develop the Karma, as well as an affordable family-size plug-in hybrid car. The loan facility was frozen at $192 million in February 2012, after the DOE claimed that Fisker missed its milestones

In December 2011, just as the Fisker Karma was launched, its battery supplier, A123 Systems, recalled all batteries, followed by a second recall in 2012. A123 filed for bankruptcy in October 2012, leaving Fisker Automotive without a battery supplier. After selling approximately 2,000 units, production of the Fisker Karma was suspended in November 2012, in the absence of its battery supplier.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/59vfj5wa8w171.png?width=511&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1c03d1e1254fea00c195776122de2b26099dd35

Henrik Fisker resigned as chairman from Fisker Automotive in March 2013, because of disagreements with management about business strategy. Later that year, the company declared voluntary bankruptcy.Fisker raised and spent more than a billion dollars over its lifetime.The heart of Fisker‚Äôs business model was in that early deal with Quantum. The idea was to design a gorgeous car, and have suppliers like Quantum provide the technology because off-the-shelf parts from suppliers would help keep costs down.

But there were problems with this strategy: Sometimes, those parts had to be custom-made to fit the design vision, which resulted in higher prices for Fisker. Other times, parts were delivered late or, worse, faulty, but Fisker was locked in to those supplier relationships. Sources close to Fisker have also said that many of the parts were owned by the suppliers themselves, so Fisker didn‚Äôt own a lot of the internal technology.

The broker that raised funds for Fisker automotive, by selling their private shares, was Advanced Equities.It wasn‚Äôt until December 2011 and into 2012 that the more dubious efforts of Advanced Equities became clearer to Fisker‚Äôs hundreds of investors. The last few hundred million dollars of Advanced Equities‚Äô fund raising for Fisker, starting with the D-1 round, was what brokers call ‚Äúpay to play.‚Äù As Fisker was running into technical, delivery and political problems, its valuation was quickly declining. But the company still needed more money, so the brokers went back to its current investors and said: Unless you give this more, your current shares will be diluted and your preferred stock will be converted to common stock.

It was essentially a gun to their heads. This is why investor Wray sued Fisker in February 2012, alleging he was on the receiving end of this tactic. In his lawsuit, he says Advanced Equities sent him a letter dated Jan. 18, 2012, stating that he needed to decide if he wanted to invest in Fisker‚Äôs next round, and pay around $84,000 by Jan. 27, 2012 ‚Äî a little over a week from receiving the letter. He also says that Advanced Equities assured him that he would have anti-dilution protection. According to the audio clip from Advanced Equities‚Äô internal sales call in early 2010, Advanced Equity leaders say that the Fisker deal will ‚Äúsuffer no dilution,‚Äù and was ‚Äúa dream scenario.‚Äù

That dream would soon end. In September 2012 after Fisker closed on $1.2 billion in funding, the bulk of it organized by Advanced Equities, the SEC charged the broker with misleading investors when it raised money for another company back in 2009 and 2010 (Bloom Energy). Advanced settled, agreeing to pay $1 million, and its co-founders were personally fined. Two months later Advanced Equities closed up shop.

Later, A123 Systems itself went bankrupt, causing more problems for Fisker. Fisker claimed that A123 Systems owed it $140 million, but a bankruptcy settlement reduced that to a paltry $15 million.

Then there was the just plain terrible luck for the ironically named Karma: Super Storm Sandy wiped out 338 of its Karmas in storage in New Jersey. The cars first drowned, and then caught on fire ‚Äî salt water damage caused a short circuit that was spread to other cars by high winds, Fisker said at the time.

With all of this happening in public ‚Äî and in a presidential election year ‚Äî Fisker‚Äôs struggles became highly politicized. The company was mentioned numerous times in presidential debates and speeches leading up to the election. Republican nominee Romney called Fisker and other DOE-supported companies losers.

The company didn‚Äôt seem to invest substantially in technology innovation or tech IP, and seemed to spend a disproportionate amount on suppliers. For example, numerous sources have said that the company paid upfront for 15,000 of some of the parts for its planned 15,000 Karmas. It ended up only selling around 2,000 of the cars. It has also been said that Fisker paid some funds upfront to have BMW make engines for the 100,000 Nina cars it hoped to produce ‚Äî in the end, Fisker didn‚Äôt deliver a single Nina.

Costs to build each Karma also creeped up because the company missed its volume targets, and because engineering had to change designs around supplier constraints. The company ended up adding $20,000 to its initial sale price.

Expensive hires may also have sucked away chunks of Fisker‚Äôs funding: Sources say that Fisker filled the upper levels of the company with seasoned auto executives from Detroit. At the high point of Fisker, the company had around 300 employees, plus dozens of contract staff. Bringing in a certain amount of the old guard could help a car startup ramp up quickly, and also impress potential investors with ‚Äúindustry names.‚Äù But those people are also used to big auto-industry budgets that included extensive travel and salaries ‚Äî that‚Äôs the opposite life of a tech startup.

## Fisker Inc.

In July 2016, Henrik Fisker expressed interest in designing a fully connected electric car with autonomous driving features and an aesthetically pleasing look. He has pursued battery technology, and hinted at potentially reviving the Fisker name with a pure-electric vehicle using technology that nobody else has. Since then Fisker has talked about delays to the promised solid state battery technology, which he does not expect to be able to be produced in volume until at least 2025. Posing risk for competition from more scientifically experienced future solid state battery producers such as Quantumscape.

***Forbes:*** ‚ÄúNow he‚Äôs back‚Äìand three things are different. First and foremost, he has a vital new partner: his wife, cofounder and Fisker Inc. CFO Geeta Gupta-Fisker. Second, his Los Angeles-based company is public this time around, raising more than $1 billion in an October 2020 IPO. And finally, Fisker‚Äôs stock price, up 56% since its debut, has made both Henrik and Geeta billionaires, each worth about $1.1 billion as of Friday‚Äôs market close. The auto industry has seen father-son and sibling leadership teams, but Fisker Inc.‚Äôs CEO-CFO combo is the fast-changing sector‚Äôs first husband and wife power couple.‚Äù

Wealth isn‚Äôt the purpose of the new company, Henrik says. ‚ÄúI never got into cars because of money. (This shows he is willing to do what is in the best interest of the company because he is not motivated by money, unlike 99% of other CEO‚Äôs)

The couple sought a big stake in the new venture to ensure they can control its fate in a way Fisker couldn‚Äôt with his earlier company.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yzhded6pfw171.png?width=408&format=png&auto=webp&s=54b30259720cf853a8efeacf058f2f74315260b9

Henrik is an auto industry celebrity, but Geeta‚Äôs background is equally impressive. A native of India, she holds multiple degrees in science, including a Ph.D. in biotechnology from Cambridge University where she was also a Research Newton Fellow. From there, she started a career in international investment for Lloyds Banking Group, and then managed investments for a high-net-worth client for several years. (In particular, this is insanely important - Geeta **KNOWS MONEY**! She knows how best to keep a company afloat, organize its share structure, provide value to shareholders, etc. because she has worked in the industry before. She may just be the most important element of Fisker Inc., due to the financial experience she has. At every step of the way, she is likely to make decisions with one sole focus - increasing share price and value).

She met her future husband in 2011 when he was visiting London, just before things started going very wrong at Fisker Automotive. They married in 2012.

‚ÄúWhen I left Fisker Automotive, all I had was my car,‚Äù Henrik remembers. ‚ÄúI'm in a different position, mainly because of Geeta. Because she cuts the deals.‚Äù

To get the new venture off the ground, the Fiskers invested the majority of their life savings‚Äìan enormous financial risk given the fate of Henrik‚Äôs prior company. Then, just as they were locking in plans for the IPO back in July, they were hit by a highly unwelcome complication: Geeta learned she had early-stage breast cancer.

‚ÄúShe got the call (from her doctor) during a call with investors,‚Äù Henrik says. Despite that bombshell, she continued working with banks and investors in the weeks that followed, even as she underwent two surgical procedures and radiation therapy. Her medical therapy concluded in November.

Henrik, who marvels at her fortitude throughout the health crisis says, ‚Äúshe only missed something like one day of work...That's just how she is. She works tirelessly.‚Äù

## Fisker Ocean

The Fisker Ocean will have a nearly 300-mile range with an 80 kWh battery and a solar panel roof as a range extender, adding approximately 1,000 free miles of range per year. Advanced electronics will be housed under the hood, and the vehicle will incorporate recycled and sustainable materials throughout. Deliveries of the Ocean are scheduled to begin in 2022.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s87j6bdsfw171.png?width=438&format=png&auto=webp&s=e40add9ce53319d31db242cce73a303afb03cbab

Fisker has also announced a partnership with Electrify America to ensure Fisker Ocean vehicles will integrate seamlessly with Electrify America charging stations when the e-SUV hits the market. With features such as a solar roof and recycled inner materials, it will be, according to Fisker Inc., the ""world's most sustainable vehicle.""

In 2017, Fisker Inc. announced that it had filed patents on flexible solid-state battery designs. Fisker expected the batteries to be produced on a mass scale around 2020. A prototype of the battery debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018. In October 2018, Fisker announced new funding for battery development through Caterpillar Venture Capital. The solid-state batteries are intended to deliver longer vehicle range and faster charging times.

In 2018, Fisker was named to the board of directors of First Cobalt, a North American cobalt refinery that produces battery materials.

In September 2019, it was announced that Fisker Inc. was partnering with Game of Thrones actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who will serve as a partner and sustainability adviser to Fisker, to work on advanced, affordable, electric mobility models.

&#x200B;

[In addition to being a well-known actor, Coster-Waldau is also the United Nations Development Program Goodwill Ambassador for climate change and other social issues.](https://preview.redd.it/3hssff5vfw171.png?width=451&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebe55e2468c5b63d1bc0ac3c71547219dff5afaa)

Nikolaj wrote this piece about Fisker:

To quote a friend of mine who is a lot smarter than me, architect Bjarke Ingels: ‚ÄúThe idea that sustainability needs to sacrifice quality of life is a flawed one. It‚Äôs a design challenge, a challenge to build something that transforms the idea of sustainability into something that will increase the quality of life for all those around it.‚Äù

One person meeting that challenge is Henrik Fisker, who has designed some of the most iconic cars over the past decades for BMW and others, like the BMW Z8, Aston Martin DB9 and Aston Martin V8 Vantage. He‚Äôs a hero for gas-guzzling supercars. He is a fellow Dane, I am a fan, and we met, of all places, on Twitter.

When we met in person, he described his new project ‚Äî an all-electric luxury SUV ‚Äî and asked me if I would help spread the word on his car. The problem as I see it with most electric cars is that they only accomplish the basics. They get you from point A to B. They run electric so you don‚Äôt pollute while driving, but that‚Äôs it. They are basically unattractive combustion engine cars that have a battery thrown into them ‚Äî and for most of them, a battery with a limited range. What Fisker does is to try to make every part of the car in a sustainable and attractive way, like a full-length solar roof, recycled floor mats and vegan leather seats. It looks incredibly cool and inviting, with a great 250- to 300-mile range, and at a cost of just under $40,000, it‚Äôs a luxury car affordable to a mass market.

I said yes and even became an investor, not only because it‚Äôs a great car but more importantly, I hope and believe it can inspire other companies to actively incorporate sustainability goals into all aspects of their business. Fisker then had the idea of calling me ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù adviser. Which I am not. Just to be clear. Thanks Henrik, sounds cool, but I am an actor and a citizen, and that‚Äôs really it.

And what about Hollywood? Is our industry changing, are we at the forefront? Looking at social media, you would think so. And things are happening, but usually only when a camera is pointed at people. Remember a few years back when all awards shows only used EVs for the red carpet? We made a difference. We mattered. We showed the way. So cool. So green, so ‚Ä¶ brief. Now it‚Äôs back to the Escalade. But hey, we are not using plastic straws anymore!

To believe that change will come from Hollywood is not really based in reality (when did that stop us?), but we are great at reacting ‚Äî and things around us are changing, and changing us. I have a good friend who loves his SUV. It‚Äôs not electric. But he cannot give up his car. He is a good guy, he‚Äôs works for the U.N., so if he has a problem going electric, we all do. But if he is presented with an alternative that doesn‚Äôt mean a reduction in his quality of life, something like the Fisker SUV, I think he‚Äôd transition to electric in a heartbeat.

The IPO deal values Fisker Inc at US$2.9 billion, with an IPO share price of $10.

On July 30, 2020, Fisker announced plans for a four-vehicle portfolio by 2025. The Fisker Ocean SUV will be joined by a sports sedan based on their previously announced Fisker Emotion concept, a coupe-like SUV, and a lifestyle pickup truck. All will be electric vehicles.

On October 15, 2020, Fisker Inc announced it would be outsourcing vehicle production of its Fisker Ocean electric SUV to Magna Steyr, to reduce the complexities and costs related to the building and operating its own factory. Magna will start building the Fisker Ocean in Europe in 2022.

## Henrik Fisker Interview quotes:

I have people on Twitter saying, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just make the car next month? You have a prototype.‚Äù Most people don‚Äôt understand that it takes 18 months to do long-lead body tooling for high-volume vehicles. Most people don‚Äôt understand it takes two years to do durability tests and do all the engineering certification and everything else.

And on the business model itself, I believe that there is nobody in the near future or the next couple of years that‚Äôs going to make a million EVs on one model. Today, there‚Äôs nobody doing it. Tesla probably has the highest volume of one single model, a couple hundred thousand. But even the big giant established carmakers are not making, right now, a couple hundred thousand vehicles of one model. So the way you get volume, in my view, is if you partner up with other OEMs and share some of the expensive parts of the platform, which in my view is not anymore something that is unique IP or something that is a unique experience to the customer. An aluminum stamped floor or a steel stamped floor really doesn‚Äôt have any brand value anymore.

And obviously, as we move forward, we always start to do some of the things ourselves. But it was really about de-risking in our first vehicle to market. So we‚Äôre going to do another three vehicles, which we can do because we don‚Äôt have to spend all our money and effort on learning how to manufacture a car, for instance.

So we have programmed a lot. We have hired a head of ESG, environmental and social governance, and he is really spearheading developing specific... we kind of put out some goals that we would like to reach with suppliers, and we at least try to bring them in that direction. They are not reaching those goals right now, but they may reach them later. And then we have goals for ourselves. So for instance, we look at transport. Are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs closer to the plant, or are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs on the other side of the planet that way we have to then transport all that stuff. So those are the types of things that we‚Äôre really thinking about now as we‚Äôre nominating suppliers. And finally, materials as well, looking at sustainable materials. We‚Äôve actually picked up a lot of knowledge on that side as well, where we are adding more sustainable materials to our vehicle. So we are actually looking across everything ‚Äî supply chain, where the suppliers are located, what the suppliers are doing for sustainability, and also then of course in the vehicle itself ‚Äî in terms of the type of materials there.

So - let's summarize - prices are rising at their fastest pace in almost 30 years and incomes just plunged by their most ever! We're gonna need more stimmies!""  

Plus  to above; 

Last year, Hirschman Capital noted that since 1821, 98% of sovereigns that hit 130% debt/GDP have defaulted on their sovereign debt.   

The US hit 130% late last year. 

Simple Conclussion : The Fed can‚Äôt go ‚Äúhawkish‚Äù and raise rates without sending markets ‚Äìand economies‚Äìto their knees; by extension, they now have nothing left to ‚Äúcut‚Äù when the current everything bubble implodes.

And that  is a *real problem*.

 There are only two ways for sovereigns to default: 

Inflation or collapse.    

The latter is not an option. 

 As for a solution, what‚Äôs so tragic is that the only option before the Fed is an even bigger problem‚Äîcurrent and inevitably more inflation. 

 That is, if the Fed wants to keep markets (and their job security) breathing, they no longer have the foregoing template of ‚Äúrate-hike-followed-by-rate-cutting‚Äù at their disposal, which means they now have no choice but to dovishly keep rates near the zero-bound indefinitely.

But the only way to keep rates ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù and nailed to the floor of time is to purchase otherwise unwanted bonds to keep their prices elevated and hence yields and rates repressed.

Such bond ‚Äúaccommodation,‚Äù of course, costs money, and as we already know, the only ‚Äúmoney‚Äù the Fed has to spend is the kind they create out of thin air‚Äì the very kind of money (and policy) which leads to the kind of inflation discussed above‚Äînamely, the brutal kind.

 As for that fake money, the evidence of the Fed‚Äôs desperate (and only) direction is now obvious, as the following M2 money supply makes equally clear. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v774ta55sw171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e73c839beb67a67eea9aed7de4ac61d86813840

 

Fed is so embarrassed by this ‚Äúprinting solution‚Äù that they‚Äôve stopped *weekly* reporting of M2 data, and frankly, since March, have even stopped *monthly* reporting of the same.

That, of course, is both telling as well as disgraceful‚Ä¶ The Fed literally has something to hide, and that never bodes well, does it?

&#x200B;

 The correlation to central bank balance sheet (i.e., money supply) expansion and rising markets is now beyond dispute. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sgizb6xcsw171.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=aad2fe681fe0c49ac20368aba77e86c118b22959

 In short‚Äîdo you see the correlation and pattern? Do you see how the Fed‚Äôs market sausage is made? More importantly, do you now see the Fed‚Äôs self-made conundrum? 

 

Given that the Fed bows to the markets not the people, which choice do you think they‚Äôll make?

In other words, expect more money printing and more yield curve control‚Äîand hence more money creation, more inflation, and by extension more fiat currency debasement.

 More money supply to keep rates monetized simply means more currency debasement and rising inflation.",nn51ou,"""Fed's ""Favorite"" #Inflation Indicator (PCE) Explodes At Fastest Rate Since 1992 As Incomes Crash By Record"""

8088,,2021-05-28 20:45:08,t3_nn76we,,wallstreetbets,"TLDR:

I have leading indicators telling me that there are two concurrent shifts underway when it comes to who is purchasing homes.

\- Massive increase in unmarried people buying houses alone. This used to be somewhat unusual, now it's becoming very common.

\- Massive increase in unmarried men, in particular, buying houses alone. Traditionally, the female-to-male ratio of unmarried homebuyers was about 5 to 1. For the last 3 months, it's been closer to 50/50.

Source is my own closed real estate purchase transactions. Am a mortgage broker (btw this means cash purchases are ""invisible"" to me). It takes 3-6 months for [HMDA data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Mortgage_Disclosure_Act) to become accessible to journalists and academics, and thus ""visible"" to the general public (assuming journalists deem it worthy of commenting on), but I can see the trends live in real time.

How would one go about placing a bet that in about 3 or 6 months, the media, journalists, academics, etc, will pick up on this, publish articles, and potentially cause a lot of people to buy certain stocks. Which stocks would that be? Is there a ""Mancave, Inc"" out there that would potentially get an uptick? Or maybe a company making smart-home stuff that is particularly suited to renting by the room (the single men are not buying 1 bedroom condos, they are buying proper houses with 3 bedrooms, etc)?

EDIT: oh, and to be clear. It's not just an uptick in single men. It's an uptick in women too, but a massive surge from the men. It used to be that for 15 banana sales, 10 are to married couples, 4 to single women, and 1 to a single man. Now for the same 15 banana sales, it's 6 to married couples, 6 to single women, and 3 to single men, something like that.",nn76we,Homebuyer Demographics Shift towards single and male. How to bet?

I have been doing research and talking to as many people I can that have some sort of experience/knowledge when dealing with the stock market. I heard about the potential to get into AMC and make some serious profit. I invested early on when shares were selling for around $8.00. I kept reading we need to hold until June 2nd and reevaluate. That‚Äôs my current plan, but hey I don‚Äôt know much about the game lol.

My current understanding of why there is a squeeze is because of previous events which backed hedge funds into a corner. Basically the hedge funds have had to borrow shares to pay off debt to companies like GME. When borrowing those shares, hedge fund companies left themselves vulnerable because they have no more money to borrow to pay off their debt. So if everyone buys stock in AMC and holds it, then the hedge fund companies are forced to pay out. The more people that buy and hold their shares then the higher the shares are worth and over time it will pay a profit. 

Like I said, I‚Äôm new to the game and this is just my current understanding of how the masses can manipulate the stock market. Please comment and enlighten me on another view point or correct my understanding. Let‚Äôs all get rich and work together with the power of knowledge!

It was on a Thursday night 02/25/2021 when I posted, at the time RKT was around 19-20 range and on the following Monday 03/01/2021 it started rallying, by 03/02 & 03/03 it hit the ATH level 43. You‚Äôre welcome to find my last DD post for verification. And for those of you who made tendies on it congratulations to you all! Spread the good energy!

As I am writing this post Today is 05/28/2021, I‚Äôll try to bring more data and technical analysis on $RKT, as you all saw what happened yesterday 05/27/2021 around lunch time upon sudden move it went from 17.50 area all the way to 19.40. This move doesn‚Äôt seem so random at all, a combination of someone noticed this to be a strategic technical squeeze just testing the water after it being suppressed down for the past 3 months, and you can see how fast the shorts started covering all of a sudden.

Today 05/28/2021, at opening it shot up to $19.20 but the shorts came prepared for $RKT this morning with their analysts and news blasting numerous articles and downgrades from Morgan Stanley, Wedbush & Zacks, ALL AT ONCE. This is certainly no coincidence.

On the technical side, on the daily chart as you can see it has a gap to fill around 22.67 area then it‚Äôll go straight to 28 and has a huge potential to pass beyond that and make it to a new all-time high, there‚Äôs nothing stopping it. On the daily MACD closed red and turned green, RSI is at the same level as last time before it squeezed to ATH $43, Parabolic S.A.R indicator flipped from red on the daily to green for the first time in 3 months. Another important factor is as you look at the volume and candle compared to last time it exploded (both red arrows) same volume, same price action.

Conclusion: the shorts are basically scared sh\*tless right now and they know it, is a tickle to the trigger for it to explode again like last time or even higher. Based on Excess Returns Model the fair value for RKT is $85, so why haven't we seen $100 yet?

8112,,2021-05-29 02:43:46,t3_nndrnf,,wallstreetbets,"AMC price will soar because:
1. AMC is officially off the bankruptcy zone, thanks to the over $2 billion equity and debt capital the company currently has. The capital can last the company for the foreseeable future. Therefore, the risk of bankruptcy makes investors confident. This will likely further drive up stock prices as more investors buy the stock.
2. AMC's recent rise in market value and share price increases have been largely driven by Reddit investors who the company says own over 80% of the company's over 480 million shares outstanding. We can expect the price to keep soaring as Reddit and other social media-based investors keep making the company's stock more and more popular on social media.
3. AMC stock will likely rise to $1 k due to the ongoing short squeeze to force short-sellers such as hedge funds to cover their losses. Short-sellers have already made millions of dollars in losses and as the short squeeze continues, share prices are expected to grow.
4. AMC stock is one of the most shorted stocks at the moment. The fact that the stock is shorted makes it more likely for share prices to keep increasing as short-sellers are forced to abandon their positions and cover losses.
5. AMC theaters are back in business after movie theater closures due to Covid regulations. The company's movie theaters are already selling out all their tickets, thereby attracting investors who see hope for the industry and expect profits to grow as the economy continues to reopen.
6. AMC's CEO Adam Aron is inspiring the Reddit investors to continue supporting the stock and become customers by going to its movie theaters. The CEO has gone ahead to increase his online activities on Twitter to engage the investors and listen to their concerns. The continuous appreciation of the online-based investors by the company's CEO will likely push the stock price higher in the coming days.

8. Big companies such as the Vanguard Group are currently buying AMC stock. The fact that big companies are willing to buy rather than sell the stock shows that they believe in a positive future for the company. These big companies encourage other institutional investors to buy the stock, thereby increasing stock prices.
9. Recent announcements by the Securities Exchange Commission that it is reviewing short-selling rules to properly protect small investors may also be a factor in contributing to further increases in AMC stock prices. If small investors know that the SEC will establish rules to protect them from the short positions adopted by hedge bets, then more small investors may be inclined to invest in AMC stock effectively increasing share prices.
10. Recent battles between small online-based investors such as those on Reddit and large hedge funds who mostly take on short positions (short-sellers) that result in job losses are also driving up and will keep driving up AMC stock. Online-based investors continue to develop a liking for shorted stocks in order to stick it up to big hedge funds. Besides, AMC is currently one of the most held stocks at the moment. This will keep driving up share prices.",nndrnf,It is just the beginning... üçø

But research and looking at balance sheets and knowing what the numbers mean and keeping up with the news is all key. And, personally, I think that everyone should build up a good foundation of index ETFs (VT, VTI, RSP, whatever) before adding on individual stocks and definitely before starting into options at all. Whether you‚Äôre a gambler, a trader, or an investor a good stable foundation that represents at least 50% of your portfolio is going to make the whole thing much much easier. 

In my opinion. 

Blind faith in shit said on the internet is not the way though. So fact check this sub, fact check me (my history is open), fact check your gut and your instincts, and put in the work more than you put in the orders and you‚Äôll be fine. (But, to shortcut, build a stable foundation, don‚Äôt hold more than 5 individual high-conviction names, don‚Äôt play weeklies. Ever.)",,

High tide is hard because it‚Äôs current valuation is stupid low so it might suddenly pop or keep trading sideways. If you get the chance to buy at $7.50 I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate the support there is very strong and has been retested for months. I would just watch and wait for the penny stock flippers to sell after the listing. Just yesterday was the perfect buy in price. Don‚Äôt fomo in an opportunity is bound to present its self.

I would also be prepared for the dilution debate that keeps persisting by uneducated investors. I won‚Äôt dive to deep but dilution is what has fueled high tides growth and the ceo is the largest shareholder, therefore it‚Äôs in his best interest to keep increasing shareholder value.

This thing is still live and hot. A lot of cynical people on here who act know better are going to look like fools once again (just like they did with GME). I could of sold for a profit today but didn't and will be loading up some more at the very beginning of next week. Bet you a lot of people who sold today are also coming back next week to push. This is just the beginning. It took a lot of dedicated people to get this far and you can bet your ass they will see this through if they haven't sold by now.

1st test flight - may 
2nd crewed flight - June 
3rd flight with R Branson on board late June/July 

4th flight this will be taking the Italian airforce on a training mission (600k a seat) late July


On the run in to the first test flight some possible maintenance issues appeared with the carrier plane White knight 2‚Ä¶. 
This indeed could have gone either way , after 2 weeks inspections it was decided that WK2 did not need to delay testing no maintenance was needed at this point. Scheduled Maintenance will commence in the fall after all tests have been completed.
Upon this news it is my opinion that the testing programme will go ahead as planned.

The market has responded accordingly and the stock is now up from $17-‚Ç¨31

With all these catalysts lined up before the end of the year and commercial operations looming for early 2022 things are looking up for Virgin Galactic.The success of the last test flight the company have now proven tech and concept. 
Also with revenue now coming in Nasa who are conducting micro gravity analysis.
Also international training for military pilots and astronauts.
Commercial flights look imminent.
Space ports planned for around the globe and intercontinental travel looming.

I had a look at $BB and assume that we finally formed the bottom. In the last few days we saw a sharp rise which might continue in the next weeks. If we can break the 12$ resistance, the next targets would be aroung 25-28$. 

Using Elliot wave theory we are probably at the end of the correction wave 4 and now began with the bullish wave 5.

Price targets:

\#1 12$

\#2 25$

\#3 48$

The risk/reward is worth entering a trade here. I bought yesterday around 10$. My stop loss is below 8$.

8525,,2021-05-28 09:17:32,t3_nmtt43,,wallstreetbets,"Trainline has taken a huge dip since the UK government's announcement of the plan to nationalise the railway network. The plan includes creating an online ticketing platform by Great British Railways which might have a huge blow on Trainline revenue. However, this platform does not yet exist and will probably take a couple of years to develop. Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed.

In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales.  Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%.

I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time  for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

This is my first time making a post here, please do give constructive feedback and criticism.

8530,,2021-05-28 10:41:01,t3_nmuzzi,,wallstreetbets,"Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent of Modernas if not more. Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects) 

Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

Imagine if the spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize one piece to understand the whole picture it and helps modify your DNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates it can still recognize the virus. In contrast to using one portion of the picture as it mutates it's easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine, that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. Not only that but they have had the least amount of side effects of any covid vaccine deeming it the safest covid vaccine.... 

And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein (whole picture) and the safety profile. Also worth a mention is that you could store it in a regular refrigerator, and let it sit out in room temperature while you're vaccinating people instead of a special ultra low temp freeze needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers, this is a majority of the world. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines so other protein competitors will be far behind and they will have an a moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing they teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine. They will be combining flu and covid vaccine by 2025 for possibly double the price of current covid vaccine.

 They are pretty much de-risked at this point. Yes you could buy other  biotechs that can go up 20x but are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up) that has all successful trials done so far, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment to where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place there are no more glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""

They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. Yesterday at market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. 
 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

Future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract in there ( in the link below in another message). It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 

As far as my position I own some $200 July calls along with about 933 shares. I'm all in baby.  Been in since $4.06, I panicked and sold once during February a couple months during the mini bear market we had and got back in a bit too early so got a wash sale üôà but I'm diamond hands all the way to $800 from here.  LFG I expect to turn that into a cool million in a year's time via shares and options based on the DD provided. Just know this isn't all completely my DD some of this is taken from my good friends at the community Nvax community on Stocktwits. They're one of the most hardcore groups that provides excellent DD and are always willing to help each other a hand if anyone's got questions highly recommend to check it out. So my point is this is information collected over the months that is a group consensus on nvax future price. (Check out next link below this paragraph, it has My positions and an amazing DD chart converting contracts to future price and comparing with competitors. My screen name on stovktwits  is the same on there Johnnyknowsbest. Been on there and here since i started with nvax.

Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. This is huge as the combo is going to differentiate them especially since both flu and covid vaccines are first in class.

Vol Trigger: Increased to 419 (Important support and resistance level. (above this level = lower volatility and a more stable stock price.)

Abs Gamma Strike: Unchanged

Gamma Notional: Decreased to $-516 (stock has larger put gamma position. A negative gamma position implies higher volatility in the underlying)

Put Wall Support: Increased to 419 (If Put Wall shifts to a higher strike it could be a bearish indication)

Call Wall Strike: Increased to 425 (When this strike is rolled higher it is generally considered bullish)

Gamma Tilt: Decreased to 0.88	 (when decreasing it‚Äôs a bearish signal.)

""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior.""
2) Being that we do not have access to a 10-K filing for Q4 fiscal '19, we will access other filings that do in fact reference numbers from fiscal '19...

B) 10-Q filing dated 5/6/2020
3) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $223.3M under Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19)
But, that is TOTAL Revenue; we need to find out what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike sales...
4) To calculate what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike Sales, we can use numbers from neighboring Q3 (i.e. Three Months Ended March 31, 2019)...
A) On page 6 of the 10-Q, you will find Revenue of ""Connected Fitness Products"" (aka Bike Sales) to be $261.6M
B) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $316.7M
C) % of Bike Sales per TOTAL Revenue: $261.6M / $316.7M * 100 = 82.6% {""Connected Fitness Products"" Revenue (aka Bike Sales)}
5) Apply 82.6% to the TOTAL Revenue $223.3M for Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19): $223.3M x 0.826 = $184.45M {Bike Sales for Q4 of fiscal '19}

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote... By mid-July, we‚Äôll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase precious metals  especially silver amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative 

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

Gold rose over 60% in the 1930s as the prices of stocks and real estate crashed. You could buy an entire block with a one ounce gold coin. Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms.

I must address Cramer's statement because he is obviously trying to add fuel to the short-selling fire: When he says ""we're not going natural gas"" he is clearly making a vague and general statement meant to be interpreted in the worst possible way: ""no one is going to buy or use natural gas."" By now, I hope everyone that is interested in this stock understands that CLNE offers an alternative transportation fuel, thus, the investments made by BP and Chevron, and not revolutionary technology like some EV's (but this is mostly hype meant to catapult EVs to the front. What most people do not realize is that driverless technology and such can be placed in Petro vehicles too). Also, unfortunately, the company has done a terrible marketting job. That's why powerful analysts can get away with making vague and unsupported statements. The fact that Cramer explained the stock's decrease over the last month as being due to widespread dissaproval is misleading, at best. Many people do not yet know about the cleanliness and therapeutic effects RNG has on the climate. We must get the word out and pressure CLNE corporate to begin marketting campaigns to get the word out. I think it's about time.",nn0whs,Cramer on CLNE

The News...

If you haven't read yet it looks like Federal Cannabis legalization my be around the corner. [Here](https://www.mpp.org/policy/federal/the-more-act/) is the House Bill. Supporters seem on board and like the reforms they have done to the bill including rescheduling cannabis. [Last time](https://mjbizdaily.com/key-us-house-lawmaker-reintroduces-federal-marijuana-legalization-bill/) the bill was introduced it cleared the House.   


Personally I think this gets a lot of support especially from a fiscal point of view. With stimulus stalling and a giant debate going on about how to pay for the stimulus I think cannabis offers the easiest way to collect federal revenue. A simple review of the bill and the fiscal benefits to the Fed's can be read [here](https://www.justtherealnews.com/congress/nadler-blumenauer-lee-jackson-lee-jeffries-velazquez-reintroduce-comprehensive-marijuana-reform-legislation/). The bill states a 5% fed tax. Money coming for uncle Sam, right when questions about paying for stimulus.... Personally I think it adds up, but that's for you to decide. 

Okay so that's the hype...

Let's talk about the tickers listed ($SNDL and $TLRY). 

$SNDL

I'll start with the cheaper YOLO, $SNDL. $SNDL short interest isn't high, but the company did issue convertible notes a while back around .7c if my memory is correct. I'm not saying they won't do it again, but they should be in a good place fiscally for now. Float is high with about 1.6B shares out there. However today's volume at the time of writing is over 415M. That's not bad given such a high float. It's about 200% more than the average volume. 

The options chain on $SNDL has me giddy. With over 200,000 options currently in the money on todays move above $1 there is some high potential here for some interesting action. The put to call ratio is just obnoxiously low at .08 it's screaming upwards betting. If we hold above $1 the potential squeeze up could be amazing.   


It's also broken up on the trend lines and out of the downward channel it was in. The regression channel from the peak squeeze back in Feb just broke out today according to my crayons I have laying around. 

$TLRY

$TLRY was the squeeze of a lifetime if you remember it back in 19'. The ticker was just a money printer with it's low float and stupid hype. Then they proceeded to do, like they all do, and issue debt. Shares tumbled since then falling from $120 --> $5. Ouch bag holders.   


Like all the cannabis stocks the Feb bump pushed $TLRY to above $60 in an amazing move. $TLRY has a lower short interest than $SNDL, but it also has a much lower float at about 300M. Compared to $SNDL the volume here isn't as good, but still remains decently above the avg volume around 36M as of right now. 

If we peep the options chain we also see a crazy low P/C ratio around .11. But we don't have the Open Interest in the chain like $SNDL does unless you roll out to Jun 18. Then we finally get some decent OI.   


Personally I am going with $SNDL. The option's chain looks better, the stock is cheaper, and the short interest is a little better. My advice would be to roll out till at least the Jun 11th $1 strike to not get eaten alive by Theta and IV crush. But WSB does what WSB wants and that's why I love you all.   
Do not go above the $2 strikes IMO. You will get crushed by theta unless we get an insane move, which could happen but I don't see the risk / reward there.",nn326f,MORE ACT / CANNABIS / $SNDL & $TLRY Potential

>A corner in the silver market has been tried before - and let's be clear, that is what is being attempted now.  In 1980, a rule change by the government destroyed the corner.  #silverthursday.

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday

>Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers‚Äô attempt to corner the market on the metal.

-
>Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926‚Äì2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers‚Äô Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.

-
>By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged‚ÄîMarch 27‚Äîsilver fell to $10.80, the metal‚Äôs biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, ‚ÄúA billion dollars isn‚Äôt what it used to be,‚Äù the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.

-
>To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978‚Äì91) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities.",nn36fw,There is no silver short squeeze happening.

* Geeta Gupta-Fisker is a solid Chief Financial Officer with experience in investment banking - she will ensure the shares are valued right
* Henrik has learned from all the mistakes he made with his previous attempt to create Fisker Automotive, and will certainly do everything in his power to avoid that mess again. He has designed systems into the intricacies of the company to avoid failure - meaning Fisker Inc is guaranteed to succeed
* Henrik Fisker on shorting $FSR - ‚ÄúYou will quickly understand that you stand to lose a lot of money if you show it against Fisker‚Äù
* Production of Fisker Ocean expected to start in November 2022
* 250,000+ units a year expected by 2025
* Partnerships with Foxconn and Magna Steyr, both giants in their respective industries, among others
* Large Fleet market in Europe gaining momentum, and 700+ Fisker reservations in this market alone
* 16,000+ reservations already. More than Tesla had 18 months pre-production
* Revenue streams include leasing automotives, servicing, selling emissions credits, selling insurance (like selling the pickaxe to miners, and selling the diamonds to the mine owners too, absolutely genius - Fisker are insuring cars which they own, because the customer is only leasing it)
* High short interest (20%+), high analyst price targets compared to current share price (100%+) and low valuation compared to peers ($3bn market cap currently)
* Designing the first ever all-electric popemobile - Massive, soon to be historic, event!
* I give $FSR (currently $13 a share) a price target of $100 by end of year 2022, if not sooner
* Price Targets: $35 by end of year - Previous ATH. $50 start of next year - European and Chinese debut of prototypes. $100 end of 2022 - start of production (SOP). $150+ 2023
* 2025 Price Targets, calculated using projected data: Bear case - $97 a share, Bull case - $519 a share
* Downside in the short term is capped by the large amount of cash on hand - one third of market cap is cash. Long term, is capped by risk factors, which are almost eligible and affect every automotive startup anyway.

## Fisker Automotive

In 2008, Fisker Automotive raised over $90 million from investors including venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. In September 2009, Fisker Automotive was awarded a $528 million loan guarantee by the United States Department of Energy (DOE). The automaker was one of four recipients of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, to encourage the domestic manufacture of electric cars. The funds were to be used to develop the Karma, as well as an affordable family-size plug-in hybrid car. The loan facility was frozen at $192 million in February 2012, after the DOE claimed that Fisker missed its milestones

In December 2011, just as the Fisker Karma was launched, its battery supplier, A123 Systems, recalled all batteries, followed by a second recall in 2012. A123 filed for bankruptcy in October 2012, leaving Fisker Automotive without a battery supplier. After selling approximately 2,000 units, production of the Fisker Karma was suspended in November 2012, in the absence of its battery supplier.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/59vfj5wa8w171.png?width=511&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1c03d1e1254fea00c195776122de2b26099dd35

Henrik Fisker resigned as chairman from Fisker Automotive in March 2013, because of disagreements with management about business strategy. Later that year, the company declared voluntary bankruptcy.Fisker raised and spent more than a billion dollars over its lifetime.The heart of Fisker‚Äôs business model was in that early deal with Quantum. The idea was to design a gorgeous car, and have suppliers like Quantum provide the technology because off-the-shelf parts from suppliers would help keep costs down.

But there were problems with this strategy: Sometimes, those parts had to be custom-made to fit the design vision, which resulted in higher prices for Fisker. Other times, parts were delivered late or, worse, faulty, but Fisker was locked in to those supplier relationships. Sources close to Fisker have also said that many of the parts were owned by the suppliers themselves, so Fisker didn‚Äôt own a lot of the internal technology.

The broker that raised funds for Fisker automotive, by selling their private shares, was Advanced Equities.It wasn‚Äôt until December 2011 and into 2012 that the more dubious efforts of Advanced Equities became clearer to Fisker‚Äôs hundreds of investors. The last few hundred million dollars of Advanced Equities‚Äô fund raising for Fisker, starting with the D-1 round, was what brokers call ‚Äúpay to play.‚Äù As Fisker was running into technical, delivery and political problems, its valuation was quickly declining. But the company still needed more money, so the brokers went back to its current investors and said: Unless you give this more, your current shares will be diluted and your preferred stock will be converted to common stock.

It was essentially a gun to their heads. This is why investor Wray sued Fisker in February 2012, alleging he was on the receiving end of this tactic. In his lawsuit, he says Advanced Equities sent him a letter dated Jan. 18, 2012, stating that he needed to decide if he wanted to invest in Fisker‚Äôs next round, and pay around $84,000 by Jan. 27, 2012 ‚Äî a little over a week from receiving the letter. He also says that Advanced Equities assured him that he would have anti-dilution protection. According to the audio clip from Advanced Equities‚Äô internal sales call in early 2010, Advanced Equity leaders say that the Fisker deal will ‚Äúsuffer no dilution,‚Äù and was ‚Äúa dream scenario.‚Äù

That dream would soon end. In September 2012 after Fisker closed on $1.2 billion in funding, the bulk of it organized by Advanced Equities, the SEC charged the broker with misleading investors when it raised money for another company back in 2009 and 2010 (Bloom Energy). Advanced settled, agreeing to pay $1 million, and its co-founders were personally fined. Two months later Advanced Equities closed up shop.

Later, A123 Systems itself went bankrupt, causing more problems for Fisker. Fisker claimed that A123 Systems owed it $140 million, but a bankruptcy settlement reduced that to a paltry $15 million.

Then there was the just plain terrible luck for the ironically named Karma: Super Storm Sandy wiped out 338 of its Karmas in storage in New Jersey. The cars first drowned, and then caught on fire ‚Äî salt water damage caused a short circuit that was spread to other cars by high winds, Fisker said at the time.

With all of this happening in public ‚Äî and in a presidential election year ‚Äî Fisker‚Äôs struggles became highly politicized. The company was mentioned numerous times in presidential debates and speeches leading up to the election. Republican nominee Romney called Fisker and other DOE-supported companies losers.

The company didn‚Äôt seem to invest substantially in technology innovation or tech IP, and seemed to spend a disproportionate amount on suppliers. For example, numerous sources have said that the company paid upfront for 15,000 of some of the parts for its planned 15,000 Karmas. It ended up only selling around 2,000 of the cars. It has also been said that Fisker paid some funds upfront to have BMW make engines for the 100,000 Nina cars it hoped to produce ‚Äî in the end, Fisker didn‚Äôt deliver a single Nina.

Costs to build each Karma also creeped up because the company missed its volume targets, and because engineering had to change designs around supplier constraints. The company ended up adding $20,000 to its initial sale price.

Expensive hires may also have sucked away chunks of Fisker‚Äôs funding: Sources say that Fisker filled the upper levels of the company with seasoned auto executives from Detroit. At the high point of Fisker, the company had around 300 employees, plus dozens of contract staff. Bringing in a certain amount of the old guard could help a car startup ramp up quickly, and also impress potential investors with ‚Äúindustry names.‚Äù But those people are also used to big auto-industry budgets that included extensive travel and salaries ‚Äî that‚Äôs the opposite life of a tech startup.

## Fisker Inc.

In July 2016, Henrik Fisker expressed interest in designing a fully connected electric car with autonomous driving features and an aesthetically pleasing look. He has pursued battery technology, and hinted at potentially reviving the Fisker name with a pure-electric vehicle using technology that nobody else has. Since then Fisker has talked about delays to the promised solid state battery technology, which he does not expect to be able to be produced in volume until at least 2025. Posing risk for competition from more scientifically experienced future solid state battery producers such as Quantumscape.

***Forbes:*** ‚ÄúNow he‚Äôs back‚Äìand three things are different. First and foremost, he has a vital new partner: his wife, cofounder and Fisker Inc. CFO Geeta Gupta-Fisker. Second, his Los Angeles-based company is public this time around, raising more than $1 billion in an October 2020 IPO. And finally, Fisker‚Äôs stock price, up 56% since its debut, has made both Henrik and Geeta billionaires, each worth about $1.1 billion as of Friday‚Äôs market close. The auto industry has seen father-son and sibling leadership teams, but Fisker Inc.‚Äôs CEO-CFO combo is the fast-changing sector‚Äôs first husband and wife power couple.‚Äù

Wealth isn‚Äôt the purpose of the new company, Henrik says. ‚ÄúI never got into cars because of money. (This shows he is willing to do what is in the best interest of the company because he is not motivated by money, unlike 99% of other CEO‚Äôs)

The couple sought a big stake in the new venture to ensure they can control its fate in a way Fisker couldn‚Äôt with his earlier company.

Henrik is an auto industry celebrity, but Geeta‚Äôs background is equally impressive. A native of India, she holds multiple degrees in science, including a Ph.D. in biotechnology from Cambridge University where she was also a Research Newton Fellow. From there, she started a career in international investment for Lloyds Banking Group, and then managed investments for a high-net-worth client for several years. (In particular, this is insanely important - Geeta **KNOWS MONEY**! She knows how best to keep a company afloat, organize its share structure, provide value to shareholders, etc. because she has worked in the industry before. She may just be the most important element of Fisker Inc., due to the financial experience she has. At every step of the way, she is likely to make decisions with one sole focus - increasing share price and value).

She met her future husband in 2011 when he was visiting London, just before things started going very wrong at Fisker Automotive. They married in 2012.

‚ÄúWhen I left Fisker Automotive, all I had was my car,‚Äù Henrik remembers. ‚ÄúI'm in a different position, mainly because of Geeta. Because she cuts the deals.‚Äù

To get the new venture off the ground, the Fiskers invested the majority of their life savings‚Äìan enormous financial risk given the fate of Henrik‚Äôs prior company. Then, just as they were locking in plans for the IPO back in July, they were hit by a highly unwelcome complication: Geeta learned she had early-stage breast cancer.

‚ÄúShe got the call (from her doctor) during a call with investors,‚Äù Henrik says. Despite that bombshell, she continued working with banks and investors in the weeks that followed, even as she underwent two surgical procedures and radiation therapy. Her medical therapy concluded in November.

Henrik, who marvels at her fortitude throughout the health crisis says, ‚Äúshe only missed something like one day of work...That's just how she is. She works tirelessly.‚Äù

## Fisker Ocean

The Fisker Ocean will have a nearly 300-mile range with an 80 kWh battery and a solar panel roof as a range extender, adding approximately 1,000 free miles of range per year. Advanced electronics will be housed under the hood, and the vehicle will incorporate recycled and sustainable materials throughout. Deliveries of the Ocean are scheduled to begin in 2022.

&#x200B;

Fisker has also announced a partnership with Electrify America to ensure Fisker Ocean vehicles will integrate seamlessly with Electrify America charging stations when the e-SUV hits the market. With features such as a solar roof and recycled inner materials, it will be, according to Fisker Inc., the ""world's most sustainable vehicle.""

In 2017, Fisker Inc. announced that it had filed patents on flexible solid-state battery designs. Fisker expected the batteries to be produced on a mass scale around 2020. A prototype of the battery debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018. In October 2018, Fisker announced new funding for battery development through Caterpillar Venture Capital. The solid-state batteries are intended to deliver longer vehicle range and faster charging times.

In 2018, Fisker was named to the board of directors of First Cobalt, a North American cobalt refinery that produces battery materials.

In September 2019, it was announced that Fisker Inc. was partnering with Game of Thrones actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who will serve as a partner and sustainability adviser to Fisker, to work on advanced, affordable, electric mobility models.

&#x200B;

[In addition to being a well-known actor, Coster-Waldau is also the United Nations Development Program Goodwill Ambassador for climate change and other social issues.](https://preview.redd.it/3hssff5vfw171.png?width=451&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebe55e2468c5b63d1bc0ac3c71547219dff5afaa)

Nikolaj wrote this piece about Fisker:

To quote a friend of mine who is a lot smarter than me, architect Bjarke Ingels: ‚ÄúThe idea that sustainability needs to sacrifice quality of life is a flawed one. It‚Äôs a design challenge, a challenge to build something that transforms the idea of sustainability into something that will increase the quality of life for all those around it.‚Äù

One person meeting that challenge is Henrik Fisker, who has designed some of the most iconic cars over the past decades for BMW and others, like the BMW Z8, Aston Martin DB9 and Aston Martin V8 Vantage. He‚Äôs a hero for gas-guzzling supercars. He is a fellow Dane, I am a fan, and we met, of all places, on Twitter.

When we met in person, he described his new project ‚Äî an all-electric luxury SUV ‚Äî and asked me if I would help spread the word on his car. The problem as I see it with most electric cars is that they only accomplish the basics. They get you from point A to B. They run electric so you don‚Äôt pollute while driving, but that‚Äôs it. They are basically unattractive combustion engine cars that have a battery thrown into them ‚Äî and for most of them, a battery with a limited range. What Fisker does is to try to make every part of the car in a sustainable and attractive way, like a full-length solar roof, recycled floor mats and vegan leather seats. It looks incredibly cool and inviting, with a great 250- to 300-mile range, and at a cost of just under $40,000, it‚Äôs a luxury car affordable to a mass market.

I said yes and even became an investor, not only because it‚Äôs a great car but more importantly, I hope and believe it can inspire other companies to actively incorporate sustainability goals into all aspects of their business. Fisker then had the idea of calling me ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù adviser. Which I am not. Just to be clear. Thanks Henrik, sounds cool, but I am an actor and a citizen, and that‚Äôs really it.

And what about Hollywood? Is our industry changing, are we at the forefront? Looking at social media, you would think so. And things are happening, but usually only when a camera is pointed at people. Remember a few years back when all awards shows only used EVs for the red carpet? We made a difference. We mattered. We showed the way. So cool. So green, so ‚Ä¶ brief. Now it‚Äôs back to the Escalade. But hey, we are not using plastic straws anymore!

To believe that change will come from Hollywood is not really based in reality (when did that stop us?), but we are great at reacting ‚Äî and things around us are changing, and changing us. I have a good friend who loves his SUV. It‚Äôs not electric. But he cannot give up his car. He is a good guy, he‚Äôs works for the U.N., so if he has a problem going electric, we all do. But if he is presented with an alternative that doesn‚Äôt mean a reduction in his quality of life, something like the Fisker SUV, I think he‚Äôd transition to electric in a heartbeat.

The IPO deal values Fisker Inc at US$2.9 billion, with an IPO share price of $10.

On July 30, 2020, Fisker announced plans for a four-vehicle portfolio by 2025. The Fisker Ocean SUV will be joined by a sports sedan based on their previously announced Fisker Emotion concept, a coupe-like SUV, and a lifestyle pickup truck. All will be electric vehicles.

On October 15, 2020, Fisker Inc announced it would be outsourcing vehicle production of its Fisker Ocean electric SUV to Magna Steyr, to reduce the complexities and costs related to the building and operating its own factory. Magna will start building the Fisker Ocean in Europe in 2022.

## Henrik Fisker Interview quotes:

I have people on Twitter saying, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just make the car next month? You have a prototype.‚Äù Most people don‚Äôt understand that it takes 18 months to do long-lead body tooling for high-volume vehicles. Most people don‚Äôt understand it takes two years to do durability tests and do all the engineering certification and everything else.

And on the business model itself, I believe that there is nobody in the near future or the next couple of years that‚Äôs going to make a million EVs on one model. Today, there‚Äôs nobody doing it. Tesla probably has the highest volume of one single model, a couple hundred thousand. But even the big giant established carmakers are not making, right now, a couple hundred thousand vehicles of one model. So the way you get volume, in my view, is if you partner up with other OEMs and share some of the expensive parts of the platform, which in my view is not anymore something that is unique IP or something that is a unique experience to the customer. An aluminum stamped floor or a steel stamped floor really doesn‚Äôt have any brand value anymore.

And obviously, as we move forward, we always start to do some of the things ourselves. But it was really about de-risking in our first vehicle to market. So we‚Äôre going to do another three vehicles, which we can do because we don‚Äôt have to spend all our money and effort on learning how to manufacture a car, for instance.

So we have programmed a lot. We have hired a head of ESG, environmental and social governance, and he is really spearheading developing specific... we kind of put out some goals that we would like to reach with suppliers, and we at least try to bring them in that direction. They are not reaching those goals right now, but they may reach them later. And then we have goals for ourselves. So for instance, we look at transport. Are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs closer to the plant, or are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs on the other side of the planet that way we have to then transport all that stuff. So those are the types of things that we‚Äôre really thinking about now as we‚Äôre nominating suppliers. And finally, materials as well, looking at sustainable materials. We‚Äôve actually picked up a lot of knowledge on that side as well, where we are adding more sustainable materials to our vehicle. So we are actually looking across everything ‚Äî supply chain, where the suppliers are located, what the suppliers are doing for sustainability, and also then of course in the vehicle itself ‚Äî in terms of the type of materials there.

https://preview.redd.it/nb8ozukrpw171.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd5a515f831dedcc57b25d717c5c133c0c74299d

So - let's summarize - prices are rising at their fastest pace in almost 30 years and incomes just plunged by their most ever! We're gonna need more stimmies!""  

Plus  to above; 

Last year, Hirschman Capital noted that since 1821, 98% of sovereigns that hit 130% debt/GDP have defaulted on their sovereign debt.   

The US hit 130% late last year. 

Simple Conclussion : The Fed can‚Äôt go ‚Äúhawkish‚Äù and raise rates without sending markets ‚Äìand economies‚Äìto their knees; by extension, they now have nothing left to ‚Äúcut‚Äù when the current everything bubble implodes.

And that  is a *real problem*.

 There are only two ways for sovereigns to default: 

Inflation or collapse.    

The latter is not an option. 

 As for a solution, what‚Äôs so tragic is that the only option before the Fed is an even bigger problem‚Äîcurrent and inevitably more inflation. 

 That is, if the Fed wants to keep markets (and their job security) breathing, they no longer have the foregoing template of ‚Äúrate-hike-followed-by-rate-cutting‚Äù at their disposal, which means they now have no choice but to dovishly keep rates near the zero-bound indefinitely.

But the only way to keep rates ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù and nailed to the floor of time is to purchase otherwise unwanted bonds to keep their prices elevated and hence yields and rates repressed.

Such bond ‚Äúaccommodation,‚Äù of course, costs money, and as we already know, the only ‚Äúmoney‚Äù the Fed has to spend is the kind they create out of thin air‚Äì the very kind of money (and policy) which leads to the kind of inflation discussed above‚Äînamely, the brutal kind.

 As for that fake money, the evidence of the Fed‚Äôs desperate (and only) direction is now obvious, as the following M2 money supply makes equally clear. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v774ta55sw171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e73c839beb67a67eea9aed7de4ac61d86813840

 

Fed is so embarrassed by this ‚Äúprinting solution‚Äù that they‚Äôve stopped *weekly* reporting of M2 data, and frankly, since March, have even stopped *monthly* reporting of the same.

That, of course, is both telling as well as disgraceful‚Ä¶ The Fed literally has something to hide, and that never bodes well, does it?

&#x200B;

 The correlation to central bank balance sheet (i.e., money supply) expansion and rising markets is now beyond dispute. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sgizb6xcsw171.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=aad2fe681fe0c49ac20368aba77e86c118b22959

 In short‚Äîdo you see the correlation and pattern? Do you see how the Fed‚Äôs market sausage is made? More importantly, do you now see the Fed‚Äôs self-made conundrum? 

 

Given that the Fed bows to the markets not the people, which choice do you think they‚Äôll make?

In other words, expect more money printing and more yield curve control‚Äîand hence more money creation, more inflation, and by extension more fiat currency debasement.

 More money supply to keep rates monetized simply means more currency debasement and rising inflation.",nn51ou,"""Fed's ""Favorite"" #Inflation Indicator (PCE) Explodes At Fastest Rate Since 1992 As Incomes Crash By Record"""

I have leading indicators telling me that there are two concurrent shifts underway when it comes to who is purchasing homes.

\- Massive increase in unmarried people buying houses alone. This used to be somewhat unusual, now it's becoming very common.

\- Massive increase in unmarried men, in particular, buying houses alone. Traditionally, the female-to-male ratio of unmarried homebuyers was about 5 to 1. For the last 3 months, it's been closer to 50/50.

Source is my own closed real estate purchase transactions. Am a mortgage broker (btw this means cash purchases are ""invisible"" to me). It takes 3-6 months for [HMDA data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Mortgage_Disclosure_Act) to become accessible to journalists and academics, and thus ""visible"" to the general public (assuming journalists deem it worthy of commenting on), but I can see the trends live in real time.

How would one go about placing a bet that in about 3 or 6 months, the media, journalists, academics, etc, will pick up on this, publish articles, and potentially cause a lot of people to buy certain stocks. Which stocks would that be? Is there a ""Mancave, Inc"" out there that would potentially get an uptick? Or maybe a company making smart-home stuff that is particularly suited to renting by the room (the single men are not buying 1 bedroom condos, they are buying proper houses with 3 bedrooms, etc)?

EDIT: oh, and to be clear. It's not just an uptick in single men. It's an uptick in women too, but a massive surge from the men. It used to be that for 15 banana sales, 10 are to married couples, 4 to single women, and 1 to a single man.

If the shares are counted by votes which is supposed to happen on 6/2/21, then all the Hedgefunds have to do is not vote, right? How does share voting/count work? 

How will they prove that synthetic shares exist if not many people participate in the count? Is it mandatory?

Is the current short interest enough to initiate a short squeeze? I think it's only at 17% at the moment, seems a little low to be honest.

8582,,2021-05-29 00:24:44,t3_nnbgwu,,wallstreetbets,"Like many of you guys on here, I initially missed out on the GameStop (GME) squeeze. Since the original hype of GME died down, I decided to play around with the stock market so I wouldn‚Äôt miss out on the next opportunity to make some money. 

I have been doing research and talking to as many people I can that have some sort of experience/knowledge when dealing with the stock market. I heard about the potential to get into AMC and make some serious profit. I invested early on when shares were selling for around $8.00. I kept reading we need to hold until June 2nd and reevaluate. That‚Äôs my current plan, but hey I don‚Äôt know much about the game lol.

My current understanding of why there is a squeeze is because of previous events which backed hedge funds into a corner. Basically the hedge funds have had to borrow shares to pay off debt to companies like GME. When borrowing those shares, hedge fund companies left themselves vulnerable because they have no more money to borrow to pay off their debt. So if everyone buys stock in AMC and holds it, then the hedge fund companies are forced to pay out. The more people that buy and hold their shares then the higher the shares are worth and over time it will pay a profit. 

Like I said, I‚Äôm new to the game and this is just my current understanding of how the masses can manipulate the stock market. Please comment and enlighten me on another view point or correct my understanding. Let‚Äôs all get rich and work together with the power of knowledge!

If you are to take away anything from this just remember: BUY AND HOLD AMC!!

1. Next Monday markets close. Definitely a gap up.

3. IV is only 40ish. Definitely a signal to yolo on TSLA calls.

It was on a Thursday night 02/25/2021 when I posted, at the time RKT was around 19-20 range and on the following Monday 03/01/2021 it started rallying, by 03/02 & 03/03 it hit the ATH level 43. You‚Äôre welcome to find my last DD post for verification. And for those of you who made tendies on it congratulations to you all! Spread the good energy!

As I am writing this post Today is 05/28/2021, I‚Äôll try to bring more data and technical analysis on $RKT, as you all saw what happened yesterday 05/27/2021 around lunch time upon sudden move it went from 17.50 area all the way to 19.40. This move doesn‚Äôt seem so random at all, a combination of someone noticed this to be a strategic technical squeeze just testing the water after it being suppressed down for the past 3 months, and you can see how fast the shorts started covering all of a sudden.

Today 05/28/2021, at opening it shot up to $19.20 but the shorts came prepared for $RKT this morning with their analysts and news blasting numerous articles and downgrades from Morgan Stanley, Wedbush & Zacks, ALL AT ONCE. This is certainly no coincidence.

On the technical side, on the daily chart as you can see it has a gap to fill around 22.67 area then it‚Äôll go straight to 28 and has a huge potential to pass beyond that and make it to a new all-time high, there‚Äôs nothing stopping it. On the daily MACD closed red and turned green, RSI is at the same level as last time before it squeezed to ATH $43, Parabolic S.A.R indicator flipped from red on the daily to green for the first time in 3 months. Another important factor is as you look at the volume and candle compared to last time it exploded (both red arrows) same volume, same price action.

Conclusion: the shorts are basically scared sh\*tless right now and they know it, is a tickle to the trigger for it to explode again like last time or even higher. Based on Excess Returns Model the fair value for RKT is $85, so why haven't we seen $100 yet?

8593,,2021-05-29 02:43:46,t3_nndrnf,,wallstreetbets,"AMC price will soar because:
1. AMC is officially off the bankruptcy zone, thanks to the over $2 billion equity and debt capital the company currently has. The capital can last the company for the foreseeable future. Therefore, the risk of bankruptcy makes investors confident. This will likely further drive up stock prices as more investors buy the stock.
2. AMC's recent rise in market value and share price increases have been largely driven by Reddit investors who the company says own over 80% of the company's over 480 million shares outstanding. We can expect the price to keep soaring as Reddit and other social media-based investors keep making the company's stock more and more popular on social media.
3. AMC stock will likely rise to $1 k due to the ongoing short squeeze to force short-sellers such as hedge funds to cover their losses. Short-sellers have already made millions of dollars in losses and as the short squeeze continues, share prices are expected to grow.
4. AMC stock is one of the most shorted stocks at the moment. The fact that the stock is shorted makes it more likely for share prices to keep increasing as short-sellers are forced to abandon their positions and cover losses.
5. AMC theaters are back in business after movie theater closures due to Covid regulations. The company's movie theaters are already selling out all their tickets, thereby attracting investors who see hope for the industry and expect profits to grow as the economy continues to reopen.
6. AMC's CEO Adam Aron is inspiring the Reddit investors to continue supporting the stock and become customers by going to its movie theaters. The CEO has gone ahead to increase his online activities on Twitter to engage the investors and listen to their concerns. The continuous appreciation of the online-based investors by the company's CEO will likely push the stock price higher in the coming days.

8. Big companies such as the Vanguard Group are currently buying AMC stock. The fact that big companies are willing to buy rather than sell the stock shows that they believe in a positive future for the company. These big companies encourage other institutional investors to buy the stock, thereby increasing stock prices.
9. Recent announcements by the Securities Exchange Commission that it is reviewing short-selling rules to properly protect small investors may also be a factor in contributing to further increases in AMC stock prices. If small investors know that the SEC will establish rules to protect them from the short positions adopted by hedge bets, then more small investors may be inclined to invest in AMC stock effectively increasing share prices.
10. Recent battles between small online-based investors such as those on Reddit and large hedge funds who mostly take on short positions (short-sellers) that result in job losses are also driving up and will keep driving up AMC stock. Online-based investors continue to develop a liking for shorted stocks in order to stick it up to big hedge funds. Besides, AMC is currently one of the most held stocks at the moment. This will keep driving up share prices.",nndrnf,It is just the beginning... üçø
8594,,2021-05-29 03:18:27,t3_nnecse,,wallstreetbets,"Reality Check:
1) Squeeze has not even begun
2) FOMO is going to drive this up beyond $40, Hollywood and celebrities, whales etc are jumping in
3) Media funded by Citadel or invested against AMC are downplaying the Wallstreet corruption, and calling this spike a reddit squeeze. They did the same with GME, and we all know that is far from over. 
4) The bashing is extreme and will get more fierce to try and convince Apes to take profits now. Very simple choice here, you want to make millions you simply buy more and hold. 
5) Those that say that 1 k per share is not feasible and would turn Wallstreet upside down are short sited. A redistribution of wealth to millions is the best thing possible for economic recovery and growth. 
6) Enjoy the ride, we are finally here at the beginning of making history. Don't panic, unless you are panic buying. Hold past the dips, the negativity and the temptation to cash out early before life changing profits.

Thing is, most options contracts don't get exercised. They either expire worthless or get sold back to the market maker, and the shares assigned to fulfil them are then sold. This means that the higher the option activity on a given security, the more likely it is to dump on a given Friday. This was *really* obvious today. That movement in the second half of the day on a Friday is pretty predictable in that it will happen, but the extent is less certain. In general selling ahead to buy back on the dip isn't worth it - for one thing it's a wash sale so any losses don't count, and for another selling shares is a taxable event so you need to be pretty confident that the value will dump more than the value of the tax you would pay on your gains.

I've simplified this quite a lot, but the tl;dr is that if you still like the stock don't worry too much about drastic price changes in the second half of friday trading.",,

I would assume either another trader purchases them and exercises it, or perhaps the writer of the contract would simply ""purchase"" the contract back by giving you the new premium, which is usually the difference in strike price and stock price.

For example, if my call option is for $100, and the stock is now at $120. I could exercise the contract to purchase the 100 shares at $100 for $10,000, then turn around and sell them for $12,000 with $2,000 of profit.

Everything looked to have gone off successfully. We are now waiting on the data and craft to be analysed and inspected. This will take a few weeks according to Michael Colglazier.
That being said he had already outlined the test schedule in the earnings zoom call.

1st test flight - may 
2nd crewed flight - June 
3rd flight with R Branson on board late June/July 

4th flight this will be taking the Italian airforce on a training mission (600k a seat) late July


On the run in to the first test flight some possible maintenance issues appeared with the carrier plane White knight 2‚Ä¶. 
This indeed could have gone either way , after 2 weeks inspections it was decided that WK2 did not need to delay testing no maintenance was needed at this point. Scheduled Maintenance will commence in the fall after all tests have been completed.
Upon this news it is my opinion that the testing programme will go ahead as planned.

The market has responded accordingly and the stock is now up from $17-‚Ç¨31

With all these catalysts lined up before the end of the year and commercial operations looming for early 2022 things are looking up for Virgin Galactic.The success of the last test flight the company have now proven tech and concept.

I had a look at $BB and assume that we finally formed the bottom. In the last few days we saw a sharp rise which might continue in the next weeks. If we can break the 12$ resistance, the next targets would be aroung 25-28$. 

Using Elliot wave theory we are probably at the end of the correction wave 4 and now began with the bullish wave 5.

Price targets:

\#1 12$

\#2 25$

\#3 48$

8862,,2021-05-28 09:17:32,t3_nmtt43,,wallstreetbets,"Trainline has taken a huge dip since the UK government's announcement of the plan to nationalise the railway network. The plan includes creating an online ticketing platform by Great British Railways which might have a huge blow on Trainline revenue. However, this platform does not yet exist and will probably take a couple of years to develop. Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed.

In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales.  Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%.

I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time  for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

This is my first time making a post here, please do give constructive feedback and criticism.

8867,,2021-05-28 10:41:01,t3_nmuzzi,,wallstreetbets,"Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent of Modernas if not more. Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects) 

Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

Imagine if the spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize one piece to understand the whole picture it and helps modify your DNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates it can still recognize the virus. In contrast to using one portion of the picture as it mutates it's easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine, that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. Not only that but they have had the least amount of side effects of any covid vaccine deeming it the safest covid vaccine.... 

And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein (whole picture) and the safety profile. Also worth a mention is that you could store it in a regular refrigerator, and let it sit out in room temperature while you're vaccinating people instead of a special ultra low temp freeze needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers, this is a majority of the world. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines so other protein competitors will be far behind and they will have an a moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing they teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine. They will be combining flu and covid vaccine by 2025 for possibly double the price of current covid vaccine.

 They are pretty much de-risked at this point. Yes you could buy other  biotechs that can go up 20x but are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up) that has all successful trials done so far, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment to where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place there are no more glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""

They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. Yesterday at market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. 
 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

Future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract in there ( in the link below in another message). It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 

As far as my position I own some $200 July calls along with about 933 shares. I'm all in baby.  Been in since $4.06, I panicked and sold once during February a couple months during the mini bear market we had and got back in a bit too early so got a wash sale üôà but I'm diamond hands all the way to $800 from here.  LFG I expect to turn that into a cool million in a year's time via shares and options based on the DD provided. Just know this isn't all completely my DD some of this is taken from my good friends at the community Nvax community on Stocktwits. They're one of the most hardcore groups that provides excellent DD and are always willing to help each other a hand if anyone's got questions highly recommend to check it out. So my point is this is information collected over the months that is a group consensus on nvax future price. (Check out next link below this paragraph, it has My positions and an amazing DD chart converting contracts to future price and comparing with competitors. My screen name on stovktwits  is the same on there Johnnyknowsbest. Been on there and here since i started with nvax.

Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. This is huge as the combo is going to differentiate them especially since both flu and covid vaccines are first in class.

Gamma Index: decreased to -0.1 (A large negative figure indicates volatility may be high. The range is from 4 to ‚Äì4.)

Vol Trigger: Increased to 419 (Important support and resistance level. (above this level = lower volatility and a more stable stock price.)

Abs Gamma Strike: Unchanged

Gamma Notional: Decreased to $-516 (stock has larger put gamma position. A negative gamma position implies higher volatility in the underlying)

Put Wall Support: Increased to 419 (If Put Wall shifts to a higher strike it could be a bearish indication)

Call Wall Strike: Increased to 425 (When this strike is rolled higher it is generally considered bullish)

Gamma Tilt: Decreased to 0.88	 (when decreasing it‚Äôs a bearish signal.)

Net Delta: Increased to 198k (positive delta position infers options market makers have a net long hedge.)

25d risk reversal: Increased to -0.06 (When the ratio shifts towards 0 it indicates call demand)

1) We look to the PTON CFO's statement found in the latest earnings call transcript, for guidance:
""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior.""
2) Being that we do not have access to a 10-K filing for Q4 fiscal '19, we will access other filings that do in fact reference numbers from fiscal '19...
A) 10-K filing dated 9/11/2020
B) 10-Q filing dated 5/6/2020
3) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $223.3M under Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19)
But, that is TOTAL Revenue; we need to find out what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike sales...
4) To calculate what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike Sales, we can use numbers from neighboring Q3 (i.e. Three Months Ended March 31, 2019)...
A) On page 6 of the 10-Q, you will find Revenue of ""Connected Fitness Products"" (aka Bike Sales) to be $261.6M
B) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $316.7M
C) % of Bike Sales per TOTAL Revenue: $261.6M / $316.7M * 100 = 82.6% {""Connected Fitness Products"" Revenue (aka Bike Sales)}
5) Apply 82.6% to the TOTAL Revenue $223.3M for Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19): $223.3M x 0.826 = $184.45M {Bike Sales for Q4 of fiscal '19}
6) Per the CFO, ""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior."":

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote... By mid-July, we‚Äôll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase precious metals  especially silver amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative 

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

Gold rose over 60% in the 1930s as the prices of stocks and real estate crashed. You could buy an entire block with a one ounce gold coin. Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms.

I must address Cramer's statement because he is obviously trying to add fuel to the short-selling fire: When he says ""we're not going natural gas"" he is clearly making a vague and general statement meant to be interpreted in the worst possible way: ""no one is going to buy or use natural gas."" By now, I hope everyone that is interested in this stock understands that CLNE offers an alternative transportation fuel, thus, the investments made by BP and Chevron, and not revolutionary technology like some EV's (but this is mostly hype meant to catapult EVs to the front. What most people do not realize is that driverless technology and such can be placed in Petro vehicles too). Also, unfortunately, the company has done a terrible marketting job. That's why powerful analysts can get away with making vague and unsupported statements. The fact that Cramer explained the stock's decrease over the last month as being due to widespread dissaproval is misleading, at best. Many people do not yet know about the cleanliness and therapeutic effects RNG has on the climate.

The News...

If you haven't read yet it looks like Federal Cannabis legalization my be around the corner. [Here](https://www.mpp.org/policy/federal/the-more-act/) is the House Bill. Supporters seem on board and like the reforms they have done to the bill including rescheduling cannabis. [Last time](https://mjbizdaily.com/key-us-house-lawmaker-reintroduces-federal-marijuana-legalization-bill/) the bill was introduced it cleared the House.   


Personally I think this gets a lot of support especially from a fiscal point of view. With stimulus stalling and a giant debate going on about how to pay for the stimulus I think cannabis offers the easiest way to collect federal revenue. A simple review of the bill and the fiscal benefits to the Fed's can be read [here](https://www.justtherealnews.com/congress/nadler-blumenauer-lee-jackson-lee-jeffries-velazquez-reintroduce-comprehensive-marijuana-reform-legislation/). The bill states a 5% fed tax. Money coming for uncle Sam, right when questions about paying for stimulus.... Personally I think it adds up, but that's for you to decide. 

Okay so that's the hype...

Let's talk about the tickers listed ($SNDL and $TLRY). 

$SNDL

I'll start with the cheaper YOLO, $SNDL. $SNDL short interest isn't high, but the company did issue convertible notes a while back around .7c if my memory is correct. I'm not saying they won't do it again, but they should be in a good place fiscally for now. Float is high with about 1.6B shares out there. However today's volume at the time of writing is over 415M. That's not bad given such a high float. It's about 200% more than the average volume. 

The options chain on $SNDL has me giddy. With over 200,000 options currently in the money on todays move above $1 there is some high potential here for some interesting action. The put to call ratio is just obnoxiously low at .08 it's screaming upwards betting. If we hold above $1 the potential squeeze up could be amazing.   


It's also broken up on the trend lines and out of the downward channel it was in. The regression channel from the peak squeeze back in Feb just broke out today according to my crayons I have laying around. 

$TLRY

$TLRY was the squeeze of a lifetime if you remember it back in 19'. The ticker was just a money printer with it's low float and stupid hype. Then they proceeded to do, like they all do, and issue debt. Shares tumbled since then falling from $120 --> $5. Ouch bag holders.   


Like all the cannabis stocks the Feb bump pushed $TLRY to above $60 in an amazing move. $TLRY has a lower short interest than $SNDL, but it also has a much lower float at about 300M. Compared to $SNDL the volume here isn't as good, but still remains decently above the avg volume around 36M as of right now. 

If we peep the options chain we also see a crazy low P/C ratio around .11. But we don't have the Open Interest in the chain like $SNDL does unless you roll out to Jun 18. Then we finally get some decent OI.   


Personally I am going with $SNDL. The option's chain looks better, the stock is cheaper, and the short interest is a little better. My advice would be to roll out till at least the Jun 11th $1 strike to not get eaten alive by Theta and IV crush. But WSB does what WSB wants and that's why I love you all.   
Do not go above the $2 strikes IMO. You will get crushed by theta unless we get an insane move, which could happen but I don't see the risk / reward there.",nn326f,MORE ACT / CANNABIS / $SNDL & $TLRY Potential

>A corner in the silver market has been tried before - and let's be clear, that is what is being attempted now.  In 1980, a rule change by the government destroyed the corner.  #silverthursday.

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday

>Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers‚Äô attempt to corner the market on the metal.

-
>Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926‚Äì2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers‚Äô Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.

-
>By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged‚ÄîMarch 27‚Äîsilver fell to $10.80, the metal‚Äôs biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, ‚ÄúA billion dollars isn‚Äôt what it used to be,‚Äù the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.

-
>To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978‚Äì91) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities.",nn36fw,There is no silver short squeeze happening.

* Henrik Fisker is a God among men in the automotive industry - trust him to do right
* Geeta Gupta-Fisker is a solid Chief Financial Officer with experience in investment banking - she will ensure the shares are valued right
* Henrik has learned from all the mistakes he made with his previous attempt to create Fisker Automotive, and will certainly do everything in his power to avoid that mess again. He has designed systems into the intricacies of the company to avoid failure - meaning Fisker Inc is guaranteed to succeed
* Henrik Fisker on shorting $FSR - ‚ÄúYou will quickly understand that you stand to lose a lot of money if you show it against Fisker‚Äù
* Production of Fisker Ocean expected to start in November 2022
* 250,000+ units a year expected by 2025
* Partnerships with Foxconn and Magna Steyr, both giants in their respective industries, among others
* Large Fleet market in Europe gaining momentum, and 700+ Fisker reservations in this market alone
* 16,000+ reservations already. More than Tesla had 18 months pre-production
* Revenue streams include leasing automotives, servicing, selling emissions credits, selling insurance (like selling the pickaxe to miners, and selling the diamonds to the mine owners too, absolutely genius - Fisker are insuring cars which they own, because the customer is only leasing it)
* High short interest (20%+), high analyst price targets compared to current share price (100%+) and low valuation compared to peers ($3bn market cap currently)
* Designing the first ever all-electric popemobile - Massive, soon to be historic, event!
* I give $FSR (currently $13 a share) a price target of $100 by end of year 2022, if not sooner
* Price Targets: $35 by end of year - Previous ATH. $50 start of next year - European and Chinese debut of prototypes. $100 end of 2022 - start of production (SOP). $150+ 2023
* 2025 Price Targets, calculated using projected data: Bear case - $97 a share, Bull case - $519 a share
* Downside in the short term is capped by the large amount of cash on hand - one third of market cap is cash. Long term, is capped by risk factors, which are almost eligible and affect every automotive startup anyway.

Fisker stated in 2018 that, with the growth of car-sharing, ride-hailing, and autonomous shuttles, he believes within 10 years private cars will be used for less than half of what they are currently used for.

## Fisker Automotive

In 2008, Fisker Automotive raised over $90 million from investors including venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. In September 2009, Fisker Automotive was awarded a $528 million loan guarantee by the United States Department of Energy (DOE). The automaker was one of four recipients of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, to encourage the domestic manufacture of electric cars. The funds were to be used to develop the Karma, as well as an affordable family-size plug-in hybrid car. The loan facility was frozen at $192 million in February 2012, after the DOE claimed that Fisker missed its milestones

In December 2011, just as the Fisker Karma was launched, its battery supplier, A123 Systems, recalled all batteries, followed by a second recall in 2012. A123 filed for bankruptcy in October 2012, leaving Fisker Automotive without a battery supplier. After selling approximately 2,000 units, production of the Fisker Karma was suspended in November 2012, in the absence of its battery supplier.

Henrik Fisker resigned as chairman from Fisker Automotive in March 2013, because of disagreements with management about business strategy. Later that year, the company declared voluntary bankruptcy.Fisker raised and spent more than a billion dollars over its lifetime.The heart of Fisker‚Äôs business model was in that early deal with Quantum. The idea was to design a gorgeous car, and have suppliers like Quantum provide the technology because off-the-shelf parts from suppliers would help keep costs down.

But there were problems with this strategy: Sometimes, those parts had to be custom-made to fit the design vision, which resulted in higher prices for Fisker. Other times, parts were delivered late or, worse, faulty, but Fisker was locked in to those supplier relationships. Sources close to Fisker have also said that many of the parts were owned by the suppliers themselves, so Fisker didn‚Äôt own a lot of the internal technology.

The broker that raised funds for Fisker automotive, by selling their private shares, was Advanced Equities.It wasn‚Äôt until December 2011 and into 2012 that the more dubious efforts of Advanced Equities became clearer to Fisker‚Äôs hundreds of investors. The last few hundred million dollars of Advanced Equities‚Äô fund raising for Fisker, starting with the D-1 round, was what brokers call ‚Äúpay to play.‚Äù As Fisker was running into technical, delivery and political problems, its valuation was quickly declining. But the company still needed more money, so the brokers went back to its current investors and said: Unless you give this more, your current shares will be diluted and your preferred stock will be converted to common stock.

It was essentially a gun to their heads. This is why investor Wray sued Fisker in February 2012, alleging he was on the receiving end of this tactic. In his lawsuit, he says Advanced Equities sent him a letter dated Jan. 18, 2012, stating that he needed to decide if he wanted to invest in Fisker‚Äôs next round, and pay around $84,000 by Jan. 27, 2012 ‚Äî a little over a week from receiving the letter. He also says that Advanced Equities assured him that he would have anti-dilution protection. According to the audio clip from Advanced Equities‚Äô internal sales call in early 2010, Advanced Equity leaders say that the Fisker deal will ‚Äúsuffer no dilution,‚Äù and was ‚Äúa dream scenario.‚Äù

That dream would soon end. In September 2012 after Fisker closed on $1.2 billion in funding, the bulk of it organized by Advanced Equities, the SEC charged the broker with misleading investors when it raised money for another company back in 2009 and 2010 (Bloom Energy). Advanced settled, agreeing to pay $1 million, and its co-founders were personally fined. Two months later Advanced Equities closed up shop.

Later, A123 Systems itself went bankrupt, causing more problems for Fisker. Fisker claimed that A123 Systems owed it $140 million, but a bankruptcy settlement reduced that to a paltry $15 million.

Then there was the just plain terrible luck for the ironically named Karma: Super Storm Sandy wiped out 338 of its Karmas in storage in New Jersey. The cars first drowned, and then caught on fire ‚Äî salt water damage caused a short circuit that was spread to other cars by high winds, Fisker said at the time.

With all of this happening in public ‚Äî and in a presidential election year ‚Äî Fisker‚Äôs struggles became highly politicized. The company was mentioned numerous times in presidential debates and speeches leading up to the election. Republican nominee Romney called Fisker and other DOE-supported companies losers.

The company didn‚Äôt seem to invest substantially in technology innovation or tech IP, and seemed to spend a disproportionate amount on suppliers. For example, numerous sources have said that the company paid upfront for 15,000 of some of the parts for its planned 15,000 Karmas. It ended up only selling around 2,000 of the cars. It has also been said that Fisker paid some funds upfront to have BMW make engines for the 100,000 Nina cars it hoped to produce ‚Äî in the end, Fisker didn‚Äôt deliver a single Nina.

Costs to build each Karma also creeped up because the company missed its volume targets, and because engineering had to change designs around supplier constraints. The company ended up adding $20,000 to its initial sale price.

Expensive hires may also have sucked away chunks of Fisker‚Äôs funding: Sources say that Fisker filled the upper levels of the company with seasoned auto executives from Detroit. At the high point of Fisker, the company had around 300 employees, plus dozens of contract staff. Bringing in a certain amount of the old guard could help a car startup ramp up quickly, and also impress potential investors with ‚Äúindustry names.‚Äù But those people are also used to big auto-industry budgets that included extensive travel and salaries ‚Äî that‚Äôs the opposite life of a tech startup.

## Fisker Inc.

In July 2016, Henrik Fisker expressed interest in designing a fully connected electric car with autonomous driving features and an aesthetically pleasing look. He has pursued battery technology, and hinted at potentially reviving the Fisker name with a pure-electric vehicle using technology that nobody else has. Since then Fisker has talked about delays to the promised solid state battery technology, which he does not expect to be able to be produced in volume until at least 2025. Posing risk for competition from more scientifically experienced future solid state battery producers such as Quantumscape.

***Forbes:*** ‚ÄúNow he‚Äôs back‚Äìand three things are different. First and foremost, he has a vital new partner: his wife, cofounder and Fisker Inc. CFO Geeta Gupta-Fisker. Second, his Los Angeles-based company is public this time around, raising more than $1 billion in an October 2020 IPO. And finally, Fisker‚Äôs stock price, up 56% since its debut, has made both Henrik and Geeta billionaires, each worth about $1.1 billion as of Friday‚Äôs market close. The auto industry has seen father-son and sibling leadership teams, but Fisker Inc.‚Äôs CEO-CFO combo is the fast-changing sector‚Äôs first husband and wife power couple.‚Äù

Wealth isn‚Äôt the purpose of the new company, Henrik says. ‚ÄúI never got into cars because of money. (This shows he is willing to do what is in the best interest of the company because he is not motivated by money, unlike 99% of other CEO‚Äôs)

The couple sought a big stake in the new venture to ensure they can control its fate in a way Fisker couldn‚Äôt with his earlier company.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yzhded6pfw171.png?width=408&format=png&auto=webp&s=54b30259720cf853a8efeacf058f2f74315260b9

Henrik is an auto industry celebrity, but Geeta‚Äôs background is equally impressive. A native of India, she holds multiple degrees in science, including a Ph.D. in biotechnology from Cambridge University where she was also a Research Newton Fellow. From there, she started a career in international investment for Lloyds Banking Group, and then managed investments for a high-net-worth client for several years. (In particular, this is insanely important - Geeta **KNOWS MONEY**! She knows how best to keep a company afloat, organize its share structure, provide value to shareholders, etc. because she has worked in the industry before. She may just be the most important element of Fisker Inc., due to the financial experience she has. At every step of the way, she is likely to make decisions with one sole focus - increasing share price and value).

She met her future husband in 2011 when he was visiting London, just before things started going very wrong at Fisker Automotive. They married in 2012.

‚ÄúWhen I left Fisker Automotive, all I had was my car,‚Äù Henrik remembers. ‚ÄúI'm in a different position, mainly because of Geeta. Because she cuts the deals.‚Äù

To get the new venture off the ground, the Fiskers invested the majority of their life savings‚Äìan enormous financial risk given the fate of Henrik‚Äôs prior company. Then, just as they were locking in plans for the IPO back in July, they were hit by a highly unwelcome complication: Geeta learned she had early-stage breast cancer.

‚ÄúShe got the call (from her doctor) during a call with investors,‚Äù Henrik says. Despite that bombshell, she continued working with banks and investors in the weeks that followed, even as she underwent two surgical procedures and radiation therapy. Her medical therapy concluded in November.

Henrik, who marvels at her fortitude throughout the health crisis says, ‚Äúshe only missed something like one day of work...That's just how she is. She works tirelessly.‚Äù

## Fisker Ocean

The Fisker Ocean will have a nearly 300-mile range with an 80 kWh battery and a solar panel roof as a range extender, adding approximately 1,000 free miles of range per year. Advanced electronics will be housed under the hood, and the vehicle will incorporate recycled and sustainable materials throughout. Deliveries of the Ocean are scheduled to begin in 2022.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s87j6bdsfw171.png?width=438&format=png&auto=webp&s=e40add9ce53319d31db242cce73a303afb03cbab

Fisker has also announced a partnership with Electrify America to ensure Fisker Ocean vehicles will integrate seamlessly with Electrify America charging stations when the e-SUV hits the market. With features such as a solar roof and recycled inner materials, it will be, according to Fisker Inc., the ""world's most sustainable vehicle.""

In 2017, Fisker Inc. announced that it had filed patents on flexible solid-state battery designs. Fisker expected the batteries to be produced on a mass scale around 2020. A prototype of the battery debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018. In October 2018, Fisker announced new funding for battery development through Caterpillar Venture Capital. The solid-state batteries are intended to deliver longer vehicle range and faster charging times.

In 2018, Fisker was named to the board of directors of First Cobalt, a North American cobalt refinery that produces battery materials.

In September 2019, it was announced that Fisker Inc. was partnering with Game of Thrones actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who will serve as a partner and sustainability adviser to Fisker, to work on advanced, affordable, electric mobility models.

&#x200B;

[In addition to being a well-known actor, Coster-Waldau is also the United Nations Development Program Goodwill Ambassador for climate change and other social issues.](https://preview.redd.it/3hssff5vfw171.png?width=451&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebe55e2468c5b63d1bc0ac3c71547219dff5afaa)

Nikolaj wrote this piece about Fisker:

To quote a friend of mine who is a lot smarter than me, architect Bjarke Ingels: ‚ÄúThe idea that sustainability needs to sacrifice quality of life is a flawed one. It‚Äôs a design challenge, a challenge to build something that transforms the idea of sustainability into something that will increase the quality of life for all those around it.‚Äù

One person meeting that challenge is Henrik Fisker, who has designed some of the most iconic cars over the past decades for BMW and others, like the BMW Z8, Aston Martin DB9 and Aston Martin V8 Vantage. He‚Äôs a hero for gas-guzzling supercars. He is a fellow Dane, I am a fan, and we met, of all places, on Twitter.

When we met in person, he described his new project ‚Äî an all-electric luxury SUV ‚Äî and asked me if I would help spread the word on his car. The problem as I see it with most electric cars is that they only accomplish the basics. They get you from point A to B. They run electric so you don‚Äôt pollute while driving, but that‚Äôs it. They are basically unattractive combustion engine cars that have a battery thrown into them ‚Äî and for most of them, a battery with a limited range. What Fisker does is to try to make every part of the car in a sustainable and attractive way, like a full-length solar roof, recycled floor mats and vegan leather seats. It looks incredibly cool and inviting, with a great 250- to 300-mile range, and at a cost of just under $40,000, it‚Äôs a luxury car affordable to a mass market.

I said yes and even became an investor, not only because it‚Äôs a great car but more importantly, I hope and believe it can inspire other companies to actively incorporate sustainability goals into all aspects of their business. Fisker then had the idea of calling me ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù adviser. Which I am not. Just to be clear. Thanks Henrik, sounds cool, but I am an actor and a citizen, and that‚Äôs really it.

And what about Hollywood? Is our industry changing, are we at the forefront? Looking at social media, you would think so. And things are happening, but usually only when a camera is pointed at people. Remember a few years back when all awards shows only used EVs for the red carpet? We made a difference. We mattered. We showed the way. So cool. So green, so ‚Ä¶ brief. Now it‚Äôs back to the Escalade. But hey, we are not using plastic straws anymore!

To believe that change will come from Hollywood is not really based in reality (when did that stop us?), but we are great at reacting ‚Äî and things around us are changing, and changing us. I have a good friend who loves his SUV. It‚Äôs not electric. But he cannot give up his car. He is a good guy, he‚Äôs works for the U.N., so if he has a problem going electric, we all do. But if he is presented with an alternative that doesn‚Äôt mean a reduction in his quality of life, something like the Fisker SUV, I think he‚Äôd transition to electric in a heartbeat.

The IPO deal values Fisker Inc at US$2.9 billion, with an IPO share price of $10.

On July 30, 2020, Fisker announced plans for a four-vehicle portfolio by 2025. The Fisker Ocean SUV will be joined by a sports sedan based on their previously announced Fisker Emotion concept, a coupe-like SUV, and a lifestyle pickup truck. All will be electric vehicles.

On October 15, 2020, Fisker Inc announced it would be outsourcing vehicle production of its Fisker Ocean electric SUV to Magna Steyr, to reduce the complexities and costs related to the building and operating its own factory. Magna will start building the Fisker Ocean in Europe in 2022.

## Henrik Fisker Interview quotes:

I have people on Twitter saying, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just make the car next month? You have a prototype.‚Äù Most people don‚Äôt understand that it takes 18 months to do long-lead body tooling for high-volume vehicles. Most people don‚Äôt understand it takes two years to do durability tests and do all the engineering certification and everything else.

And on the business model itself, I believe that there is nobody in the near future or the next couple of years that‚Äôs going to make a million EVs on one model. Today, there‚Äôs nobody doing it. Tesla probably has the highest volume of one single model, a couple hundred thousand. But even the big giant established carmakers are not making, right now, a couple hundred thousand vehicles of one model. So the way you get volume, in my view, is if you partner up with other OEMs and share some of the expensive parts of the platform, which in my view is not anymore something that is unique IP or something that is a unique experience to the customer. An aluminum stamped floor or a steel stamped floor really doesn‚Äôt have any brand value anymore.

And obviously, as we move forward, we always start to do some of the things ourselves. But it was really about de-risking in our first vehicle to market. So we‚Äôre going to do another three vehicles, which we can do because we don‚Äôt have to spend all our money and effort on learning how to manufacture a car, for instance.

So we have programmed a lot. We have hired a head of ESG, environmental and social governance, and he is really spearheading developing specific... we kind of put out some goals that we would like to reach with suppliers, and we at least try to bring them in that direction. They are not reaching those goals right now, but they may reach them later. And then we have goals for ourselves. So for instance, we look at transport. Are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs closer to the plant, or are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs on the other side of the planet that way we have to then transport all that stuff. So those are the types of things that we‚Äôre really thinking about now as we‚Äôre nominating suppliers. And finally, materials as well, looking at sustainable materials. We‚Äôve actually picked up a lot of knowledge on that side as well, where we are adding more sustainable materials to our vehicle. So we are actually looking across everything ‚Äî supply chain, where the suppliers are located, what the suppliers are doing for sustainability, and also then of course in the vehicle itself ‚Äî in terms of the type of materials there.

https://preview.redd.it/nb8ozukrpw171.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd5a515f831dedcc57b25d717c5c133c0c74299d

So - let's summarize - prices are rising at their fastest pace in almost 30 years and incomes just plunged by their most ever! We're gonna need more stimmies!""  

Plus  to above; 

Last year, Hirschman Capital noted that since 1821, 98% of sovereigns that hit 130% debt/GDP have defaulted on their sovereign debt.   

The US hit 130% late last year. 

Simple Conclussion : The Fed can‚Äôt go ‚Äúhawkish‚Äù and raise rates without sending markets ‚Äìand economies‚Äìto their knees; by extension, they now have nothing left to ‚Äúcut‚Äù when the current everything bubble implodes.

And that  is a *real problem*.

 There are only two ways for sovereigns to default: 

Inflation or collapse.    

The latter is not an option. 

 As for a solution, what‚Äôs so tragic is that the only option before the Fed is an even bigger problem‚Äîcurrent and inevitably more inflation. 

 That is, if the Fed wants to keep markets (and their job security) breathing, they no longer have the foregoing template of ‚Äúrate-hike-followed-by-rate-cutting‚Äù at their disposal, which means they now have no choice but to dovishly keep rates near the zero-bound indefinitely.

But the only way to keep rates ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù and nailed to the floor of time is to purchase otherwise unwanted bonds to keep their prices elevated and hence yields and rates repressed.

Such bond ‚Äúaccommodation,‚Äù of course, costs money, and as we already know, the only ‚Äúmoney‚Äù the Fed has to spend is the kind they create out of thin air‚Äì the very kind of money (and policy) which leads to the kind of inflation discussed above‚Äînamely, the brutal kind.

 As for that fake money, the evidence of the Fed‚Äôs desperate (and only) direction is now obvious, as the following M2 money supply makes equally clear. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v774ta55sw171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e73c839beb67a67eea9aed7de4ac61d86813840

 

Fed is so embarrassed by this ‚Äúprinting solution‚Äù that they‚Äôve stopped *weekly* reporting of M2 data, and frankly, since March, have even stopped *monthly* reporting of the same.

That, of course, is both telling as well as disgraceful‚Ä¶ The Fed literally has something to hide, and that never bodes well, does it?

&#x200B;

 The correlation to central bank balance sheet (i.e., money supply) expansion and rising markets is now beyond dispute. 

&#x200B;

 In short‚Äîdo you see the correlation and pattern? Do you see how the Fed‚Äôs market sausage is made? More importantly, do you now see the Fed‚Äôs self-made conundrum? 

 

Given that the Fed bows to the markets not the people, which choice do you think they‚Äôll make?

In other words, expect more money printing and more yield curve control‚Äîand hence more money creation, more inflation, and by extension more fiat currency debasement.

 More money supply to keep rates monetized simply means more currency debasement and rising inflation.",nn51ou,"""Fed's ""Favorite"" #Inflation Indicator (PCE) Explodes At Fastest Rate Since 1992 As Incomes Crash By Record"""

8906,,2021-05-28 20:45:08,t3_nn76we,,wallstreetbets,"TLDR:

I have leading indicators telling me that there are two concurrent shifts underway when it comes to who is purchasing homes.

\- Massive increase in unmarried people buying houses alone. This used to be somewhat unusual, now it's becoming very common.

\- Massive increase in unmarried men, in particular, buying houses alone. Traditionally, the female-to-male ratio of unmarried homebuyers was about 5 to 1. For the last 3 months, it's been closer to 50/50.

Source is my own closed real estate purchase transactions. Am a mortgage broker (btw this means cash purchases are ""invisible"" to me). It takes 3-6 months for [HMDA data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Mortgage_Disclosure_Act) to become accessible to journalists and academics, and thus ""visible"" to the general public (assuming journalists deem it worthy of commenting on), but I can see the trends live in real time.

How would one go about placing a bet that in about 3 or 6 months, the media, journalists, academics, etc, will pick up on this, publish articles, and potentially cause a lot of people to buy certain stocks. Which stocks would that be? Is there a ""Mancave, Inc"" out there that would potentially get an uptick? Or maybe a company making smart-home stuff that is particularly suited to renting by the room (the single men are not buying 1 bedroom condos, they are buying proper houses with 3 bedrooms, etc)?

EDIT: oh, and to be clear. It's not just an uptick in single men. It's an uptick in women too, but a massive surge from the men. It used to be that for 15 banana sales, 10 are to married couples, 4 to single women, and 1 to a single man. Now for the same 15 banana sales, it's 6 to married couples, 6 to single women, and 3 to single men, something like that.",nn76we,Homebuyer Demographics Shift towards single and male. How to bet?

I have been doing research and talking to as many people I can that have some sort of experience/knowledge when dealing with the stock market. I heard about the potential to get into AMC and make some serious profit. I invested early on when shares were selling for around $8.00. I kept reading we need to hold until June 2nd and reevaluate. That‚Äôs my current plan, but hey I don‚Äôt know much about the game lol.

My current understanding of why there is a squeeze is because of previous events which backed hedge funds into a corner. Basically the hedge funds have had to borrow shares to pay off debt to companies like GME. When borrowing those shares, hedge fund companies left themselves vulnerable because they have no more money to borrow to pay off their debt. So if everyone buys stock in AMC and holds it, then the hedge fund companies are forced to pay out. The more people that buy and hold their shares then the higher the shares are worth and over time it will pay a profit. 

Like I said, I‚Äôm new to the game and this is just my current understanding of how the masses can manipulate the stock market. Please comment and enlighten me on another view point or correct my understanding. Let‚Äôs all get rich and work together with the power of knowledge!

It was on a Thursday night 02/25/2021 when I posted, at the time RKT was around 19-20 range and on the following Monday 03/01/2021 it started rallying, by 03/02 & 03/03 it hit the ATH level 43. You‚Äôre welcome to find my last DD post for verification. And for those of you who made tendies on it congratulations to you all! Spread the good energy!

As I am writing this post Today is 05/28/2021, I‚Äôll try to bring more data and technical analysis on $RKT, as you all saw what happened yesterday 05/27/2021 around lunch time upon sudden move it went from 17.50 area all the way to 19.40. This move doesn‚Äôt seem so random at all, a combination of someone noticed this to be a strategic technical squeeze just testing the water after it being suppressed down for the past 3 months, and you can see how fast the shorts started covering all of a sudden.

Today 05/28/2021, at opening it shot up to $19.20 but the shorts came prepared for $RKT this morning with their analysts and news blasting numerous articles and downgrades from Morgan Stanley, Wedbush & Zacks, ALL AT ONCE. This is certainly no coincidence.

On the technical side, on the daily chart as you can see it has a gap to fill around 22.67 area then it‚Äôll go straight to 28 and has a huge potential to pass beyond that and make it to a new all-time high, there‚Äôs nothing stopping it. On the daily MACD closed red and turned green, RSI is at the same level as last time before it squeezed to ATH $43, Parabolic S.A.R indicator flipped from red on the daily to green for the first time in 3 months. Another important factor is as you look at the volume and candle compared to last time it exploded (both red arrows) same volume, same price action.

Conclusion: the shorts are basically scared sh\*tless right now and they know it, is a tickle to the trigger for it to explode again like last time or even higher. Based on Excess Returns Model the fair value for RKT is $85, so why haven't we seen $100 yet?

8929,,2021-05-29 02:43:46,t3_nndrnf,,wallstreetbets,"AMC price will soar because:
1. AMC is officially off the bankruptcy zone, thanks to the over $2 billion equity and debt capital the company currently has. The capital can last the company for the foreseeable future. Therefore, the risk of bankruptcy makes investors confident. This will likely further drive up stock prices as more investors buy the stock.
2. AMC's recent rise in market value and share price increases have been largely driven by Reddit investors who the company says own over 80% of the company's over 480 million shares outstanding. We can expect the price to keep soaring as Reddit and other social media-based investors keep making the company's stock more and more popular on social media.
3. AMC stock will likely rise to $1 k due to the ongoing short squeeze to force short-sellers such as hedge funds to cover their losses. Short-sellers have already made millions of dollars in losses and as the short squeeze continues, share prices are expected to grow.
4. AMC stock is one of the most shorted stocks at the moment. The fact that the stock is shorted makes it more likely for share prices to keep increasing as short-sellers are forced to abandon their positions and cover losses.
5. AMC theaters are back in business after movie theater closures due to Covid regulations. The company's movie theaters are already selling out all their tickets, thereby attracting investors who see hope for the industry and expect profits to grow as the economy continues to reopen.
6. AMC's CEO Adam Aron is inspiring the Reddit investors to continue supporting the stock and become customers by going to its movie theaters. The CEO has gone ahead to increase his online activities on Twitter to engage the investors and listen to their concerns. The continuous appreciation of the online-based investors by the company's CEO will likely push the stock price higher in the coming days.

8. Big companies such as the Vanguard Group are currently buying AMC stock. The fact that big companies are willing to buy rather than sell the stock shows that they believe in a positive future for the company. These big companies encourage other institutional investors to buy the stock, thereby increasing stock prices.
9. Recent announcements by the Securities Exchange Commission that it is reviewing short-selling rules to properly protect small investors may also be a factor in contributing to further increases in AMC stock prices. If small investors know that the SEC will establish rules to protect them from the short positions adopted by hedge bets, then more small investors may be inclined to invest in AMC stock effectively increasing share prices.
10. Recent battles between small online-based investors such as those on Reddit and large hedge funds who mostly take on short positions (short-sellers) that result in job losses are also driving up and will keep driving up AMC stock. Online-based investors continue to develop a liking for shorted stocks in order to stick it up to big hedge funds. Besides, AMC is currently one of the most held stocks at the moment. This will keep driving up share prices.",nndrnf,It is just the beginning... üçø

4) The bashing is extreme and will get more fierce to try and convince Apes to take profits now. Very simple choice here, you want to make millions you simply buy more and hold. 
5) Those that say that 1 k per share is not feasible and would turn Wallstreet upside down are short sited. A redistribution of wealth to millions is the best thing possible for economic recovery and growth.

I am no financial advisor and this is not a recommendation, just knowledge I would like to share.. Heres to Vertex Energy and why I think it won't stop rising in price for the next few days...

First off, we have the $75 million deal to buy the Mobile refinery in Alabama from Royal Dutch Shell PLC which is expected to close by the end of the year, and would be the largest and most significant transaction Vertex has ever completed.

With the $85 million conversion of the Mobile refinery's hydrocracking unit, Vertex expects the refinery will have the potential to generate at least $3 billion in annual sales and $400 million of gross profit annually beginning in 2023.

As part of this transaction, Vertex will assume ownership of more than 3 million barrels of crude oil and product storage, together with other valuable logistics assets. Our vision for this site is that of diversification. We will seek to lead the southeast region in marketing next generation fuels and products that are not currently produced by the refinery today.

Vertex will become the sole owner and operator of the refinery upon closing. The refinery, which has a long track record of safe, reliable operations and consistent financial performance, will become Vertex's flagship refining asset upon the close of the transaction, positioning the Company to become a pure-play producer of renewable and conventional products. Highly attractive transaction economics, pro-forma for renewable diesel fuel project.

Still with me? Ok, so...

Vertex expects the average gross profit per barrel on its renewable diesel production will be significantly higher than that of the Mobile refinery's conventional fuels production, including the benefit of tax subsidies and carbon-reduction incentives. As this project involves the conversion of an existing, operating process unit, Vertex anticipates that both the capital cost and anticipated time-to-market will be significantly less than that of comparable greenfield conversion projects.‚Äã

Also, here's what Alvaro Ruiz, EVP of Corporate Development at Vertex had to say:

""As part of this transaction, we plan to enter into a multi-year crude supply and product offtake agreements with several highly-respected counterparties, including Shell, who has been an exceptional partner throughout the sale process. We believe these agreements will position us to reduce our working capital requirements, while mitigating spot market risk on product sales. Upon closing, we expect to hedge a significant portion of the first-year production, reducing our near-term exposure to movements in refined product margins, as we focus on completing the planned asset conversion, which remains the most significant near-term economic driver resulting from this transaction.""

BIG NEWS BOYS AND GIRLS‚Äã
Most important√® piece of info, right here:‚§µÔ∏è


PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION: Vertex intends to enter into a multi-year product off-take agreement with Shell, while continuing to supply Bunker Holding (""Bunker One"") under an existing 10-year agreement. Under the agreements, Shell and Bunker One will purchase 100% of the Mobile refinery's conventional fuels production. Concurrent with this arrangement, Vertex will enter into a separate, long-term agreement under which Idemitsu Apollo Corporation, a wholly-owned California-based subsidiary of Idemitsu Kosan, will purchase 100% of the Mobile refinery's renewable diesel fuel production. The sale of all conventional and unconventional fuels will be priced against spot market index prices.‚Äã

Okay, whew, that was beginning to strain MY eyes.. Here's - to me, the best thing out of all this info and the best for our future as a cleaner environment: 

Renewable diesel is a biofuel that can be produced from organic waste and vegetable oils. Renewable diesel is a sustainable, fungible replacement for petroleum-based diesel fuel. While California remains the primary market for domestically produced renewable diesel, given the economic benefits for its use under the state's Low Carbon Fuel Standard, other states are expected to follow suit, creating significant, incremental demand during the next decade. Once operable, the Mobile refinery's converted hydrocracking unit will be capable of processing a wide range of organic, pre-treated feedstocks, including soybean and corn oil, meat tallow and waste vegetable oils, among others.‚Äã

Whole Foods even today doesn't have anywhere close to RAD's revenue. So to build out the infrastructure of what RAD already has in place would take Amazon many many years and twice the money. Why when could buy the whole operations. Merge them with Amazon Pharmacy and still place them inside Whole Foods. Along with their existing location.

I HAD EDITED THE POST EARLIER THAT WAS EXPLAINING THE SAME STUFF JUST VERY OUT OF ORDER AND HARD TO UNDERSTAND  
If you guys will take possibly 5 minutes to read what's below you will have a great understanding of what is going to happen to AMC. ITS GOING TO BE FUCKING INSANITY  
You guys seriously don't know what's about to happen, this has been setup since the first squeeze in February and if you DON'T read what's below you WON'T know what to do with your stock. YOU WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY SEE 100% TO 500% GAINS POSSIBLY MORE  
Basically in February when AMC had its ""short squeeze"" the hedge funds were fucked, right, they bet billions of dollars on like a couple dollar per share shorts so when that went up to $10 to $15 to $20 per share, the hedge funds were fucked, right, they had to cover they're shorts and it would put them hundreds of billions in debt. however to cover a short you can either pay it off, or borrow more shorts form the brokerage, they lend out short shares that are expected to be paid back. usually a company has hundreds of millions of short shares available. so when it had that squeeze back in February the hedge funds had to cover their shorts which was billions of dollars, but, they didn't have to cover ALL of their shorts because AMC will MAKE hedge funds pay a fraction of the shorts that they owe (usually when the price reaches highs and brokerages get scared) and then let them borrow the rest. and that's what they did. they kept borrowing shares so that they didn't have to pay the hundreds of billions that they owe. however after the squeeze since the hedge funds still had most of their shorts to cover since they borrowed even more instead of paying them off, they were still trying to get the most out of debt possible, and to do that they had to keep shorting it. WELL MOTHERFUCKERS IT IS TIME. THEY HAVE JUST BEEN CONSTANTLY SHORTING IT FOR MONTHS. THERE ARE NO MORE SHORTS AVAILABLE TO BORROW. THE HEDGEFUNDS ARE HAVING TO PAY PAY BECAUSE LIKE I WAS TALKING ABOUT EARLIER YOU CAN EITHER PAY OR BORROW MORE AND THERE SIMPLY ISNT ANYMORE TO BORROW THEY HAVE TO FUCKING PAY THE HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THEYVE BEEN PUTTING OFF FOR THE LAST 3 MONTHS. AND BETTER YET THE STOCK HAS TRIPLED THIS WEEK AND THE HEDGEFUNDS HAVE PAYED CLOSE TO 0% OF WHAT THEY OWE. THEY HAVENT EVEN STARTED TO PAY YET.

So what that the pandemic is ending even before the pandemic growth stocks were still king. Nothing is changing. Dare I suggest that these institutions are on the wrong cock?

Restaurants grow revenue at like 5% a year, compared to tech that grows at 50-300% rates. As an investor at the end of the day you want the company to boom in revenue and/or profit to get a good return.

THEY'RE SCARED FOR YOU TO SEE THIS

FOR ALL OF YOU MOTHERFUCKERS IN AMC THIS IS FOR YOU  
If you guys will take possibly 5 minutes to read what's below you will have a great understanding of what is going to happen to AMC. ITS GOING TO BE FUCKING INSANITY  
You guys seriously don't know what's about to happen, this has been setup since the first squeeze in February and if you DON'T read what's below you WON'T know what to do with your stock. YOU WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY SEE 100% TO 500% GAINS POSSIBLY MORE  
Basically in February when AMC had its ""short squeeze"" the hedge funds were fucked, right, they bet billions of dollars on like a couple dollar per share shorts so when that went up to $10 to $15 to $20 per share, the hedge funds were fucked, right, they had to cover they're shorts and it would put them hundreds of billions in debt. however to cover a short you can either pay it off, or borrow more shorts form the brokerage, they lend out short shares that are expected to be paid back. usually a company has hundreds of millions of short shares available. so when it had that squeeze back in February the hedge funds had to cover their shorts which was billions of dollars, but, they didn't have to cover ALL of their shorts because AMC will MAKE hedge funds pay a fraction of the shorts that they owe (usually when the price reaches highs and brokerages get scared) and then let them borrow the rest. and that's what they did. they kept borrowing shares so that they didn't have to pay the hundreds of billions that they owe. however after the squeeze since the hedge funds still had most of their shorts to cover since they borrowed even more instead of paying them off, they were still trying to get the most out of debt possible, and to do that they had to keep shorting it. WELL MOTHERFUCKERS IT IS TIME. THEY HAVE JUST BEEN CONSTANTLY SHORTING IT FOR MONTHS. THERE ARE NO MORE SHORTS AVAILABLE TO BORROW. THE HEDGEFUNDS ARE HAVING TO PAY PAY BECAUSE LIKE I WAS TALKING ABOUT EARLIER YOU CAN EITHER PAY OR BORROW MORE AND THERE SIMPLY ISNT ANYMORE TO BORROW THEY HAVE TO FUCKING PAY THE HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THEYVE BEEN PUTTING OFF FOR THE LAST 3 MONTHS. AND BETTER YET THE STOCK HAS TRIPLED THIS WEEK AND THE HEDGEFUNDS HAVE PAYED CLOSE TO 0% OF WHAT THEY OWE. THEY HAVENT EVEN STARTED TO PAY YET.

9642,,2021-05-28 10:41:01,t3_nmuzzi,,wallstreetbets,"Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent of Modernas if not more. Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects) 

Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

Imagine if the spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize one piece to understand the whole picture it and helps modify your DNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates it can still recognize the virus. In contrast to using one portion of the picture as it mutates it's easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine, that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. Not only that but they have had the least amount of side effects of any covid vaccine deeming it the safest covid vaccine.... 

And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein (whole picture) and the safety profile. Also worth a mention is that you could store it in a regular refrigerator, and let it sit out in room temperature while you're vaccinating people instead of a special ultra low temp freeze needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers, this is a majority of the world. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines so other protein competitors will be far behind and they will have an a moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing they teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine. They will be combining flu and covid vaccine by 2025 for possibly double the price of current covid vaccine.

 They are pretty much de-risked at this point. Yes you could buy other  biotechs that can go up 20x but are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up) that has all successful trials done so far, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment to where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place there are no more glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""

They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. Yesterday at market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. 
 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

Future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract in there ( in the link below in another message). It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 

As far as my position I own some $200 July calls along with about 933 shares. I'm all in baby.  Been in since $4.06, I panicked and sold once during February a couple months during the mini bear market we had and got back in a bit too early so got a wash sale üôà but I'm diamond hands all the way to $800 from here.  LFG I expect to turn that into a cool million in a year's time via shares and options based on the DD provided. Just know this isn't all completely my DD some of this is taken from my good friends at the community Nvax community on Stocktwits. They're one of the most hardcore groups that provides excellent DD and are always willing to help each other a hand if anyone's got questions highly recommend to check it out. So my point is this is information collected over the months that is a group consensus on nvax future price. (Check out next link below this paragraph, it has My positions and an amazing DD chart converting contracts to future price and comparing with competitors. My screen name on stovktwits  is the same on there Johnnyknowsbest. Been on there and here since i started with nvax.

Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. This is huge as the combo is going to differentiate them especially since both flu and covid vaccines are first in class.

# SPY SG:

Looks like low volatility day. Play tight.

Note from SG: ""For todays expiration our models show about 15% SPX /30% SPY gamma expiring, which could allow volatility increase a bit into next week. This in turn may free markets for a push up into that 4250 target (Call Wall) area.""

Gamma Index: decreased to -0.1 (A large negative figure indicates volatility may be high. The range is from 4 to ‚Äì4.)

Vol Trigger: Increased to 419 (Important support and resistance level. (above this level = lower volatility and a more stable stock price.)

Abs Gamma Strike: Unchanged

Gamma Notional: Decreased to $-516 (stock has larger put gamma position. A negative gamma position implies higher volatility in the underlying)

Put Wall Support: Increased to 419 (If Put Wall shifts to a higher strike it could be a bearish indication)

Call Wall Strike: Increased to 425 (When this strike is rolled higher it is generally considered bullish)

Gamma Tilt: Decreased to 0.88	 (when decreasing it‚Äôs a bearish signal.)

Net Delta: Increased to 198k (positive delta position infers options market makers have a net long hedge.)

25d risk reversal: Increased to -0.06 (When the ratio shifts towards 0 it indicates call demand)

Topp Abs Gamma Strikes: 	\[420, 419, 418, 415\]

Somebody posted this in the Rite Aid sub. Can one of the more astute people here comment on this? Is this a real possibility? 

The news that leaked that Amazon was interested in physical locations makes me wonder, but they‚Äôve had years to buy Rite Aid, CVS or Walgreens. So far they‚Äôve done nothing but Pillpack, which has been mostly a failure.

1) We look to the PTON CFO's statement found in the latest earnings call transcript, for guidance:
""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior.""
2) Being that we do not have access to a 10-K filing for Q4 fiscal '19, we will access other filings that do in fact reference numbers from fiscal '19...
A) 10-K filing dated 9/11/2020
B) 10-Q filing dated 5/6/2020
3) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $223.3M under Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19)
But, that is TOTAL Revenue; we need to find out what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike sales...
4) To calculate what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike Sales, we can use numbers from neighboring Q3 (i.e. Three Months Ended March 31, 2019)...
A) On page 6 of the 10-Q, you will find Revenue of ""Connected Fitness Products"" (aka Bike Sales) to be $261.6M
B) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $316.7M
C) % of Bike Sales per TOTAL Revenue: $261.6M / $316.7M * 100 = 82.6% {""Connected Fitness Products"" Revenue (aka Bike Sales)}
5) Apply 82.6% to the TOTAL Revenue $223.3M for Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19): $223.3M x 0.826 = $184.45M {Bike Sales for Q4 of fiscal '19}
6) Per the CFO, ""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior."":

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote... By mid-July, we‚Äôll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase precious metals  especially silver amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative 

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

Gold rose over 60% in the 1930s as the prices of stocks and real estate crashed. You could buy an entire block with a one ounce gold coin. Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms.

I must address Cramer's statement because he is obviously trying to add fuel to the short-selling fire: When he says ""we're not going natural gas"" he is clearly making a vague and general statement meant to be interpreted in the worst possible way: ""no one is going to buy or use natural gas."" By now, I hope everyone that is interested in this stock understands that CLNE offers an alternative transportation fuel, thus, the investments made by BP and Chevron, and not revolutionary technology like some EV's (but this is mostly hype meant to catapult EVs to the front. What most people do not realize is that driverless technology and such can be placed in Petro vehicles too). Also, unfortunately, the company has done a terrible marketting job. That's why powerful analysts can get away with making vague and unsupported statements. The fact that Cramer explained the stock's decrease over the last month as being due to widespread dissaproval is misleading, at best. Many people do not yet know about the cleanliness and therapeutic effects RNG has on the climate.

The News...

If you haven't read yet it looks like Federal Cannabis legalization my be around the corner. [Here](https://www.mpp.org/policy/federal/the-more-act/) is the House Bill. Supporters seem on board and like the reforms they have done to the bill including rescheduling cannabis. [Last time](https://mjbizdaily.com/key-us-house-lawmaker-reintroduces-federal-marijuana-legalization-bill/) the bill was introduced it cleared the House.   


Personally I think this gets a lot of support especially from a fiscal point of view. With stimulus stalling and a giant debate going on about how to pay for the stimulus I think cannabis offers the easiest way to collect federal revenue. A simple review of the bill and the fiscal benefits to the Fed's can be read [here](https://www.justtherealnews.com/congress/nadler-blumenauer-lee-jackson-lee-jeffries-velazquez-reintroduce-comprehensive-marijuana-reform-legislation/). The bill states a 5% fed tax. Money coming for uncle Sam, right when questions about paying for stimulus.... Personally I think it adds up, but that's for you to decide. 

Okay so that's the hype...

Let's talk about the tickers listed ($SNDL and $TLRY). 

$SNDL

I'll start with the cheaper YOLO, $SNDL. $SNDL short interest isn't high, but the company did issue convertible notes a while back around .7c if my memory is correct. I'm not saying they won't do it again, but they should be in a good place fiscally for now. Float is high with about 1.6B shares out there. However today's volume at the time of writing is over 415M. That's not bad given such a high float. It's about 200% more than the average volume. 

The options chain on $SNDL has me giddy. With over 200,000 options currently in the money on todays move above $1 there is some high potential here for some interesting action. The put to call ratio is just obnoxiously low at .08 it's screaming upwards betting. If we hold above $1 the potential squeeze up could be amazing.   


It's also broken up on the trend lines and out of the downward channel it was in. The regression channel from the peak squeeze back in Feb just broke out today according to my crayons I have laying around. 

$TLRY

$TLRY was the squeeze of a lifetime if you remember it back in 19'. The ticker was just a money printer with it's low float and stupid hype. Then they proceeded to do, like they all do, and issue debt. Shares tumbled since then falling from $120 --> $5. Ouch bag holders.   


Like all the cannabis stocks the Feb bump pushed $TLRY to above $60 in an amazing move. $TLRY has a lower short interest than $SNDL, but it also has a much lower float at about 300M. Compared to $SNDL the volume here isn't as good, but still remains decently above the avg volume around 36M as of right now. 

If we peep the options chain we also see a crazy low P/C ratio around .11. But we don't have the Open Interest in the chain like $SNDL does unless you roll out to Jun 18. Then we finally get some decent OI.   


Personally I am going with $SNDL. The option's chain looks better, the stock is cheaper, and the short interest is a little better. My advice would be to roll out till at least the Jun 11th $1 strike to not get eaten alive by Theta and IV crush. But WSB does what WSB wants and that's why I love you all.   
Do not go above the $2 strikes IMO. You will get crushed by theta unless we get an insane move, which could happen but I don't see the risk / reward there.",nn326f,MORE ACT / CANNABIS / $SNDL & $TLRY Potential

>A corner in the silver market has been tried before - and let's be clear, that is what is being attempted now.  In 1980, a rule change by the government destroyed the corner.  #silverthursday.

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday

>Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers‚Äô attempt to corner the market on the metal.

-
>Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926‚Äì2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers‚Äô Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.

-
>By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged‚ÄîMarch 27‚Äîsilver fell to $10.80, the metal‚Äôs biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, ‚ÄúA billion dollars isn‚Äôt what it used to be,‚Äù the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.

-
>To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978‚Äì91) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities.",nn36fw,There is no silver short squeeze happening.

* Henrik Fisker is a God among men in the automotive industry - trust him to do right
* Geeta Gupta-Fisker is a solid Chief Financial Officer with experience in investment banking - she will ensure the shares are valued right
* Henrik has learned from all the mistakes he made with his previous attempt to create Fisker Automotive, and will certainly do everything in his power to avoid that mess again. He has designed systems into the intricacies of the company to avoid failure - meaning Fisker Inc is guaranteed to succeed
* Henrik Fisker on shorting $FSR - ‚ÄúYou will quickly understand that you stand to lose a lot of money if you show it against Fisker‚Äù
* Production of Fisker Ocean expected to start in November 2022
* 250,000+ units a year expected by 2025
* Partnerships with Foxconn and Magna Steyr, both giants in their respective industries, among others
* Large Fleet market in Europe gaining momentum, and 700+ Fisker reservations in this market alone
* 16,000+ reservations already. More than Tesla had 18 months pre-production
* Revenue streams include leasing automotives, servicing, selling emissions credits, selling insurance (like selling the pickaxe to miners, and selling the diamonds to the mine owners too, absolutely genius - Fisker are insuring cars which they own, because the customer is only leasing it)
* High short interest (20%+), high analyst price targets compared to current share price (100%+) and low valuation compared to peers ($3bn market cap currently)
* Designing the first ever all-electric popemobile - Massive, soon to be historic, event!
* I give $FSR (currently $13 a share) a price target of $100 by end of year 2022, if not sooner
* Price Targets: $35 by end of year - Previous ATH. $50 start of next year - European and Chinese debut of prototypes. $100 end of 2022 - start of production (SOP). $150+ 2023
* 2025 Price Targets, calculated using projected data: Bear case - $97 a share, Bull case - $519 a share
* Downside in the short term is capped by the large amount of cash on hand - one third of market cap is cash. Long term, is capped by risk factors, which are almost eligible and affect every automotive startup anyway.

Fisker stated in 2018 that, with the growth of car-sharing, ride-hailing, and autonomous shuttles, he believes within 10 years private cars will be used for less than half of what they are currently used for.

## Fisker Automotive

In 2008, Fisker Automotive raised over $90 million from investors including venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. In September 2009, Fisker Automotive was awarded a $528 million loan guarantee by the United States Department of Energy (DOE). The automaker was one of four recipients of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, to encourage the domestic manufacture of electric cars. The funds were to be used to develop the Karma, as well as an affordable family-size plug-in hybrid car. The loan facility was frozen at $192 million in February 2012, after the DOE claimed that Fisker missed its milestones

In December 2011, just as the Fisker Karma was launched, its battery supplier, A123 Systems, recalled all batteries, followed by a second recall in 2012. A123 filed for bankruptcy in October 2012, leaving Fisker Automotive without a battery supplier. After selling approximately 2,000 units, production of the Fisker Karma was suspended in November 2012, in the absence of its battery supplier.

Henrik Fisker resigned as chairman from Fisker Automotive in March 2013, because of disagreements with management about business strategy. Later that year, the company declared voluntary bankruptcy.Fisker raised and spent more than a billion dollars over its lifetime.The heart of Fisker‚Äôs business model was in that early deal with Quantum. The idea was to design a gorgeous car, and have suppliers like Quantum provide the technology because off-the-shelf parts from suppliers would help keep costs down.

But there were problems with this strategy: Sometimes, those parts had to be custom-made to fit the design vision, which resulted in higher prices for Fisker. Other times, parts were delivered late or, worse, faulty, but Fisker was locked in to those supplier relationships. Sources close to Fisker have also said that many of the parts were owned by the suppliers themselves, so Fisker didn‚Äôt own a lot of the internal technology.

The broker that raised funds for Fisker automotive, by selling their private shares, was Advanced Equities.It wasn‚Äôt until December 2011 and into 2012 that the more dubious efforts of Advanced Equities became clearer to Fisker‚Äôs hundreds of investors. The last few hundred million dollars of Advanced Equities‚Äô fund raising for Fisker, starting with the D-1 round, was what brokers call ‚Äúpay to play.‚Äù As Fisker was running into technical, delivery and political problems, its valuation was quickly declining. But the company still needed more money, so the brokers went back to its current investors and said: Unless you give this more, your current shares will be diluted and your preferred stock will be converted to common stock.

It was essentially a gun to their heads. This is why investor Wray sued Fisker in February 2012, alleging he was on the receiving end of this tactic. In his lawsuit, he says Advanced Equities sent him a letter dated Jan. 18, 2012, stating that he needed to decide if he wanted to invest in Fisker‚Äôs next round, and pay around $84,000 by Jan. 27, 2012 ‚Äî a little over a week from receiving the letter. He also says that Advanced Equities assured him that he would have anti-dilution protection. According to the audio clip from Advanced Equities‚Äô internal sales call in early 2010, Advanced Equity leaders say that the Fisker deal will ‚Äúsuffer no dilution,‚Äù and was ‚Äúa dream scenario.‚Äù

That dream would soon end. In September 2012 after Fisker closed on $1.2 billion in funding, the bulk of it organized by Advanced Equities, the SEC charged the broker with misleading investors when it raised money for another company back in 2009 and 2010 (Bloom Energy). Advanced settled, agreeing to pay $1 million, and its co-founders were personally fined. Two months later Advanced Equities closed up shop.

Later, A123 Systems itself went bankrupt, causing more problems for Fisker. Fisker claimed that A123 Systems owed it $140 million, but a bankruptcy settlement reduced that to a paltry $15 million.

Then there was the just plain terrible luck for the ironically named Karma: Super Storm Sandy wiped out 338 of its Karmas in storage in New Jersey. The cars first drowned, and then caught on fire ‚Äî salt water damage caused a short circuit that was spread to other cars by high winds, Fisker said at the time.

With all of this happening in public ‚Äî and in a presidential election year ‚Äî Fisker‚Äôs struggles became highly politicized. The company was mentioned numerous times in presidential debates and speeches leading up to the election. Republican nominee Romney called Fisker and other DOE-supported companies losers.

The company didn‚Äôt seem to invest substantially in technology innovation or tech IP, and seemed to spend a disproportionate amount on suppliers. For example, numerous sources have said that the company paid upfront for 15,000 of some of the parts for its planned 15,000 Karmas. It ended up only selling around 2,000 of the cars. It has also been said that Fisker paid some funds upfront to have BMW make engines for the 100,000 Nina cars it hoped to produce ‚Äî in the end, Fisker didn‚Äôt deliver a single Nina.

Costs to build each Karma also creeped up because the company missed its volume targets, and because engineering had to change designs around supplier constraints. The company ended up adding $20,000 to its initial sale price.

Expensive hires may also have sucked away chunks of Fisker‚Äôs funding: Sources say that Fisker filled the upper levels of the company with seasoned auto executives from Detroit. At the high point of Fisker, the company had around 300 employees, plus dozens of contract staff. Bringing in a certain amount of the old guard could help a car startup ramp up quickly, and also impress potential investors with ‚Äúindustry names.‚Äù But those people are also used to big auto-industry budgets that included extensive travel and salaries ‚Äî that‚Äôs the opposite life of a tech startup.

## Fisker Inc.

In July 2016, Henrik Fisker expressed interest in designing a fully connected electric car with autonomous driving features and an aesthetically pleasing look. He has pursued battery technology, and hinted at potentially reviving the Fisker name with a pure-electric vehicle using technology that nobody else has. Since then Fisker has talked about delays to the promised solid state battery technology, which he does not expect to be able to be produced in volume until at least 2025. Posing risk for competition from more scientifically experienced future solid state battery producers such as Quantumscape.

***Forbes:*** ‚ÄúNow he‚Äôs back‚Äìand three things are different. First and foremost, he has a vital new partner: his wife, cofounder and Fisker Inc. CFO Geeta Gupta-Fisker. Second, his Los Angeles-based company is public this time around, raising more than $1 billion in an October 2020 IPO. And finally, Fisker‚Äôs stock price, up 56% since its debut, has made both Henrik and Geeta billionaires, each worth about $1.1 billion as of Friday‚Äôs market close. The auto industry has seen father-son and sibling leadership teams, but Fisker Inc.‚Äôs CEO-CFO combo is the fast-changing sector‚Äôs first husband and wife power couple.‚Äù

Wealth isn‚Äôt the purpose of the new company, Henrik says. ‚ÄúI never got into cars because of money. (This shows he is willing to do what is in the best interest of the company because he is not motivated by money, unlike 99% of other CEO‚Äôs)

The couple sought a big stake in the new venture to ensure they can control its fate in a way Fisker couldn‚Äôt with his earlier company.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yzhded6pfw171.png?width=408&format=png&auto=webp&s=54b30259720cf853a8efeacf058f2f74315260b9

Henrik is an auto industry celebrity, but Geeta‚Äôs background is equally impressive. A native of India, she holds multiple degrees in science, including a Ph.D. in biotechnology from Cambridge University where she was also a Research Newton Fellow. From there, she started a career in international investment for Lloyds Banking Group, and then managed investments for a high-net-worth client for several years. (In particular, this is insanely important - Geeta **KNOWS MONEY**! She knows how best to keep a company afloat, organize its share structure, provide value to shareholders, etc. because she has worked in the industry before. She may just be the most important element of Fisker Inc., due to the financial experience she has. At every step of the way, she is likely to make decisions with one sole focus - increasing share price and value).

She met her future husband in 2011 when he was visiting London, just before things started going very wrong at Fisker Automotive. They married in 2012.

‚ÄúWhen I left Fisker Automotive, all I had was my car,‚Äù Henrik remembers. ‚ÄúI'm in a different position, mainly because of Geeta. Because she cuts the deals.‚Äù

To get the new venture off the ground, the Fiskers invested the majority of their life savings‚Äìan enormous financial risk given the fate of Henrik‚Äôs prior company. Then, just as they were locking in plans for the IPO back in July, they were hit by a highly unwelcome complication: Geeta learned she had early-stage breast cancer.

‚ÄúShe got the call (from her doctor) during a call with investors,‚Äù Henrik says. Despite that bombshell, she continued working with banks and investors in the weeks that followed, even as she underwent two surgical procedures and radiation therapy. Her medical therapy concluded in November.

Henrik, who marvels at her fortitude throughout the health crisis says, ‚Äúshe only missed something like one day of work...That's just how she is. She works tirelessly.‚Äù

## Fisker Ocean

The Fisker Ocean will have a nearly 300-mile range with an 80 kWh battery and a solar panel roof as a range extender, adding approximately 1,000 free miles of range per year. Advanced electronics will be housed under the hood, and the vehicle will incorporate recycled and sustainable materials throughout. Deliveries of the Ocean are scheduled to begin in 2022.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s87j6bdsfw171.png?width=438&format=png&auto=webp&s=e40add9ce53319d31db242cce73a303afb03cbab

Fisker has also announced a partnership with Electrify America to ensure Fisker Ocean vehicles will integrate seamlessly with Electrify America charging stations when the e-SUV hits the market. With features such as a solar roof and recycled inner materials, it will be, according to Fisker Inc., the ""world's most sustainable vehicle.""

In 2017, Fisker Inc. announced that it had filed patents on flexible solid-state battery designs. Fisker expected the batteries to be produced on a mass scale around 2020. A prototype of the battery debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018. In October 2018, Fisker announced new funding for battery development through Caterpillar Venture Capital. The solid-state batteries are intended to deliver longer vehicle range and faster charging times.

In 2018, Fisker was named to the board of directors of First Cobalt, a North American cobalt refinery that produces battery materials.

In September 2019, it was announced that Fisker Inc. was partnering with Game of Thrones actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who will serve as a partner and sustainability adviser to Fisker, to work on advanced, affordable, electric mobility models.

&#x200B;

[In addition to being a well-known actor, Coster-Waldau is also the United Nations Development Program Goodwill Ambassador for climate change and other social issues.](https://preview.redd.it/3hssff5vfw171.png?width=451&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebe55e2468c5b63d1bc0ac3c71547219dff5afaa)

Nikolaj wrote this piece about Fisker:

To quote a friend of mine who is a lot smarter than me, architect Bjarke Ingels: ‚ÄúThe idea that sustainability needs to sacrifice quality of life is a flawed one. It‚Äôs a design challenge, a challenge to build something that transforms the idea of sustainability into something that will increase the quality of life for all those around it.‚Äù

One person meeting that challenge is Henrik Fisker, who has designed some of the most iconic cars over the past decades for BMW and others, like the BMW Z8, Aston Martin DB9 and Aston Martin V8 Vantage. He‚Äôs a hero for gas-guzzling supercars. He is a fellow Dane, I am a fan, and we met, of all places, on Twitter.

When we met in person, he described his new project ‚Äî an all-electric luxury SUV ‚Äî and asked me if I would help spread the word on his car. The problem as I see it with most electric cars is that they only accomplish the basics. They get you from point A to B. They run electric so you don‚Äôt pollute while driving, but that‚Äôs it. They are basically unattractive combustion engine cars that have a battery thrown into them ‚Äî and for most of them, a battery with a limited range. What Fisker does is to try to make every part of the car in a sustainable and attractive way, like a full-length solar roof, recycled floor mats and vegan leather seats. It looks incredibly cool and inviting, with a great 250- to 300-mile range, and at a cost of just under $40,000, it‚Äôs a luxury car affordable to a mass market.

I said yes and even became an investor, not only because it‚Äôs a great car but more importantly, I hope and believe it can inspire other companies to actively incorporate sustainability goals into all aspects of their business. Fisker then had the idea of calling me ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù adviser. Which I am not. Just to be clear. Thanks Henrik, sounds cool, but I am an actor and a citizen, and that‚Äôs really it.

And what about Hollywood? Is our industry changing, are we at the forefront? Looking at social media, you would think so. And things are happening, but usually only when a camera is pointed at people. Remember a few years back when all awards shows only used EVs for the red carpet? We made a difference. We mattered. We showed the way. So cool. So green, so ‚Ä¶ brief. Now it‚Äôs back to the Escalade. But hey, we are not using plastic straws anymore!

To believe that change will come from Hollywood is not really based in reality (when did that stop us?), but we are great at reacting ‚Äî and things around us are changing, and changing us. I have a good friend who loves his SUV. It‚Äôs not electric. But he cannot give up his car. He is a good guy, he‚Äôs works for the U.N., so if he has a problem going electric, we all do. But if he is presented with an alternative that doesn‚Äôt mean a reduction in his quality of life, something like the Fisker SUV, I think he‚Äôd transition to electric in a heartbeat.

The IPO deal values Fisker Inc at US$2.9 billion, with an IPO share price of $10.

On July 30, 2020, Fisker announced plans for a four-vehicle portfolio by 2025. The Fisker Ocean SUV will be joined by a sports sedan based on their previously announced Fisker Emotion concept, a coupe-like SUV, and a lifestyle pickup truck. All will be electric vehicles.

On October 15, 2020, Fisker Inc announced it would be outsourcing vehicle production of its Fisker Ocean electric SUV to Magna Steyr, to reduce the complexities and costs related to the building and operating its own factory. Magna will start building the Fisker Ocean in Europe in 2022.

## Henrik Fisker Interview quotes:

I have people on Twitter saying, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just make the car next month? You have a prototype.‚Äù Most people don‚Äôt understand that it takes 18 months to do long-lead body tooling for high-volume vehicles. Most people don‚Äôt understand it takes two years to do durability tests and do all the engineering certification and everything else.

And on the business model itself, I believe that there is nobody in the near future or the next couple of years that‚Äôs going to make a million EVs on one model. Today, there‚Äôs nobody doing it. Tesla probably has the highest volume of one single model, a couple hundred thousand. But even the big giant established carmakers are not making, right now, a couple hundred thousand vehicles of one model. So the way you get volume, in my view, is if you partner up with other OEMs and share some of the expensive parts of the platform, which in my view is not anymore something that is unique IP or something that is a unique experience to the customer. An aluminum stamped floor or a steel stamped floor really doesn‚Äôt have any brand value anymore.

And obviously, as we move forward, we always start to do some of the things ourselves. But it was really about de-risking in our first vehicle to market. So we‚Äôre going to do another three vehicles, which we can do because we don‚Äôt have to spend all our money and effort on learning how to manufacture a car, for instance.

So we have programmed a lot. We have hired a head of ESG, environmental and social governance, and he is really spearheading developing specific... we kind of put out some goals that we would like to reach with suppliers, and we at least try to bring them in that direction. They are not reaching those goals right now, but they may reach them later. And then we have goals for ourselves. So for instance, we look at transport. Are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs closer to the plant, or are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs on the other side of the planet that way we have to then transport all that stuff. So those are the types of things that we‚Äôre really thinking about now as we‚Äôre nominating suppliers. And finally, materials as well, looking at sustainable materials. We‚Äôve actually picked up a lot of knowledge on that side as well, where we are adding more sustainable materials to our vehicle. So we are actually looking across everything ‚Äî supply chain, where the suppliers are located, what the suppliers are doing for sustainability, and also then of course in the vehicle itself ‚Äî in terms of the type of materials there.

https://preview.redd.it/nb8ozukrpw171.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd5a515f831dedcc57b25d717c5c133c0c74299d

So - let's summarize - prices are rising at their fastest pace in almost 30 years and incomes just plunged by their most ever! We're gonna need more stimmies!""  

Plus  to above; 

Last year, Hirschman Capital noted that since 1821, 98% of sovereigns that hit 130% debt/GDP have defaulted on their sovereign debt.   

The US hit 130% late last year. 

Simple Conclussion : The Fed can‚Äôt go ‚Äúhawkish‚Äù and raise rates without sending markets ‚Äìand economies‚Äìto their knees; by extension, they now have nothing left to ‚Äúcut‚Äù when the current everything bubble implodes.

And that  is a *real problem*.

 There are only two ways for sovereigns to default: 

Inflation or collapse.    

The latter is not an option. 

 As for a solution, what‚Äôs so tragic is that the only option before the Fed is an even bigger problem‚Äîcurrent and inevitably more inflation. 

 That is, if the Fed wants to keep markets (and their job security) breathing, they no longer have the foregoing template of ‚Äúrate-hike-followed-by-rate-cutting‚Äù at their disposal, which means they now have no choice but to dovishly keep rates near the zero-bound indefinitely.

But the only way to keep rates ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù and nailed to the floor of time is to purchase otherwise unwanted bonds to keep their prices elevated and hence yields and rates repressed.

Such bond ‚Äúaccommodation,‚Äù of course, costs money, and as we already know, the only ‚Äúmoney‚Äù the Fed has to spend is the kind they create out of thin air‚Äì the very kind of money (and policy) which leads to the kind of inflation discussed above‚Äînamely, the brutal kind.

 As for that fake money, the evidence of the Fed‚Äôs desperate (and only) direction is now obvious, as the following M2 money supply makes equally clear. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v774ta55sw171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e73c839beb67a67eea9aed7de4ac61d86813840

 

Fed is so embarrassed by this ‚Äúprinting solution‚Äù that they‚Äôve stopped *weekly* reporting of M2 data, and frankly, since March, have even stopped *monthly* reporting of the same.

That, of course, is both telling as well as disgraceful‚Ä¶ The Fed literally has something to hide, and that never bodes well, does it?

&#x200B;

 The correlation to central bank balance sheet (i.e., money supply) expansion and rising markets is now beyond dispute. 

&#x200B;

 In short‚Äîdo you see the correlation and pattern? Do you see how the Fed‚Äôs market sausage is made? More importantly, do you now see the Fed‚Äôs self-made conundrum? 

 

Given that the Fed bows to the markets not the people, which choice do you think they‚Äôll make?

In other words, expect more money printing and more yield curve control‚Äîand hence more money creation, more inflation, and by extension more fiat currency debasement.

 More money supply to keep rates monetized simply means more currency debasement and rising inflation.",nn51ou,"""Fed's ""Favorite"" #Inflation Indicator (PCE) Explodes At Fastest Rate Since 1992 As Incomes Crash By Record"""

I have leading indicators telling me that there are two concurrent shifts underway when it comes to who is purchasing homes.

\- Massive increase in unmarried people buying houses alone. This used to be somewhat unusual, now it's becoming very common.

\- Massive increase in unmarried men, in particular, buying houses alone. Traditionally, the female-to-male ratio of unmarried homebuyers was about 5 to 1. For the last 3 months, it's been closer to 50/50.

Source is my own closed real estate purchase transactions. Am a mortgage broker (btw this means cash purchases are ""invisible"" to me). It takes 3-6 months for [HMDA data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Mortgage_Disclosure_Act) to become accessible to journalists and academics, and thus ""visible"" to the general public (assuming journalists deem it worthy of commenting on), but I can see the trends live in real time.

How would one go about placing a bet that in about 3 or 6 months, the media, journalists, academics, etc, will pick up on this, publish articles, and potentially cause a lot of people to buy certain stocks. Which stocks would that be? Is there a ""Mancave, Inc"" out there that would potentially get an uptick? Or maybe a company making smart-home stuff that is particularly suited to renting by the room (the single men are not buying 1 bedroom condos, they are buying proper houses with 3 bedrooms, etc)?

EDIT: oh, and to be clear. It's not just an uptick in single men. It's an uptick in women too, but a massive surge from the men. It used to be that for 15 banana sales, 10 are to married couples, 4 to single women, and 1 to a single man. Now for the same 15 banana sales, it's 6 to married couples, 6 to single women, and 3 to single men, something like that.",nn76we,Homebuyer Demographics Shift towards single and male. How to bet?

I have been doing research and talking to as many people I can that have some sort of experience/knowledge when dealing with the stock market. I heard about the potential to get into AMC and make some serious profit. I invested early on when shares were selling for around $8.00. I kept reading we need to hold until June 2nd and reevaluate. That‚Äôs my current plan, but hey I don‚Äôt know much about the game lol.

My current understanding of why there is a squeeze is because of previous events which backed hedge funds into a corner. Basically the hedge funds have had to borrow shares to pay off debt to companies like GME. When borrowing those shares, hedge fund companies left themselves vulnerable because they have no more money to borrow to pay off their debt. So if everyone buys stock in AMC and holds it, then the hedge fund companies are forced to pay out. The more people that buy and hold their shares then the higher the shares are worth and over time it will pay a profit. 

Like I said, I‚Äôm new to the game and this is just my current understanding of how the masses can manipulate the stock market. Please comment and enlighten me on another view point or correct my understanding. Let‚Äôs all get rich and work together with the power of knowledge!

It was on a Thursday night 02/25/2021 when I posted, at the time RKT was around 19-20 range and on the following Monday 03/01/2021 it started rallying, by 03/02 & 03/03 it hit the ATH level 43. You‚Äôre welcome to find my last DD post for verification. And for those of you who made tendies on it congratulations to you all! Spread the good energy!

As I am writing this post Today is 05/28/2021, I‚Äôll try to bring more data and technical analysis on $RKT, as you all saw what happened yesterday 05/27/2021 around lunch time upon sudden move it went from 17.50 area all the way to 19.40. This move doesn‚Äôt seem so random at all, a combination of someone noticed this to be a strategic technical squeeze just testing the water after it being suppressed down for the past 3 months, and you can see how fast the shorts started covering all of a sudden.

Today 05/28/2021, at opening it shot up to $19.20 but the shorts came prepared for $RKT this morning with their analysts and news blasting numerous articles and downgrades from Morgan Stanley, Wedbush & Zacks, ALL AT ONCE. This is certainly no coincidence.

On the technical side, on the daily chart as you can see it has a gap to fill around 22.67 area then it‚Äôll go straight to 28 and has a huge potential to pass beyond that and make it to a new all-time high, there‚Äôs nothing stopping it. On the daily MACD closed red and turned green, RSI is at the same level as last time before it squeezed to ATH $43, Parabolic S.A.R indicator flipped from red on the daily to green for the first time in 3 months. Another important factor is as you look at the volume and candle compared to last time it exploded (both red arrows) same volume, same price action.

Conclusion: the shorts are basically scared sh\*tless right now and they know it, is a tickle to the trigger for it to explode again like last time or even higher. Based on Excess Returns Model the fair value for RKT is $85, so why haven't we seen $100 yet?

9704,,2021-05-29 02:43:46,t3_nndrnf,,wallstreetbets,"AMC price will soar because:
1. AMC is officially off the bankruptcy zone, thanks to the over $2 billion equity and debt capital the company currently has. The capital can last the company for the foreseeable future. Therefore, the risk of bankruptcy makes investors confident. This will likely further drive up stock prices as more investors buy the stock.
2. AMC's recent rise in market value and share price increases have been largely driven by Reddit investors who the company says own over 80% of the company's over 480 million shares outstanding. We can expect the price to keep soaring as Reddit and other social media-based investors keep making the company's stock more and more popular on social media.
3. AMC stock will likely rise to $1 k due to the ongoing short squeeze to force short-sellers such as hedge funds to cover their losses. Short-sellers have already made millions of dollars in losses and as the short squeeze continues, share prices are expected to grow.
4. AMC stock is one of the most shorted stocks at the moment. The fact that the stock is shorted makes it more likely for share prices to keep increasing as short-sellers are forced to abandon their positions and cover losses.
5. AMC theaters are back in business after movie theater closures due to Covid regulations. The company's movie theaters are already selling out all their tickets, thereby attracting investors who see hope for the industry and expect profits to grow as the economy continues to reopen.
6. AMC's CEO Adam Aron is inspiring the Reddit investors to continue supporting the stock and become customers by going to its movie theaters. The CEO has gone ahead to increase his online activities on Twitter to engage the investors and listen to their concerns. The continuous appreciation of the online-based investors by the company's CEO will likely push the stock price higher in the coming days.

8. Big companies such as the Vanguard Group are currently buying AMC stock. The fact that big companies are willing to buy rather than sell the stock shows that they believe in a positive future for the company. These big companies encourage other institutional investors to buy the stock, thereby increasing stock prices.
9. Recent announcements by the Securities Exchange Commission that it is reviewing short-selling rules to properly protect small investors may also be a factor in contributing to further increases in AMC stock prices. If small investors know that the SEC will establish rules to protect them from the short positions adopted by hedge bets, then more small investors may be inclined to invest in AMC stock effectively increasing share prices.
10. Recent battles between small online-based investors such as those on Reddit and large hedge funds who mostly take on short positions (short-sellers) that result in job losses are also driving up and will keep driving up AMC stock. Online-based investors continue to develop a liking for shorted stocks in order to stick it up to big hedge funds. Besides, AMC is currently one of the most held stocks at the moment.

I am no financial advisor and this is not a recommendation, just knowledge I would like to share.. Heres to Vertex Energy and why I think it won't stop rising in price for the next few days...

First off, we have the $75 million deal to buy the Mobile refinery in Alabama from Royal Dutch Shell PLC which is expected to close by the end of the year, and would be the largest and most significant transaction Vertex has ever completed.

With the additional $85 million conversion of the Mobile refinery's hydrocracking unit, Vertex expects the refinery will have the potential to generate at least $3 billion in annual sales and $400 million of gross profit annually beginning in 2023.

As part of this transaction, Vertex will assume ownership of more than 3 million barrels of crude oil and product storage, together with other valuable logistics assets. Our vision for this site is that of diversification. We will seek to lead the southeast region in marketing next generation fuels and products that are not currently produced by the refinery today.

Vertex will become the sole owner and operator of the refinery upon closing. The refinery, which has a long track record of safe, reliable operations and consistent financial performance, will become Vertex's flagship refining asset upon the close of the transaction, positioning the Company to become a pure-play producer of renewable and conventional products. Highly attractive transaction economics, pro-forma for renewable diesel fuel project.

Still with me? Ok, so...

Vertex expects the average gross profit per barrel on its renewable diesel production will be significantly higher than that of the Mobile refinery's conventional fuels production, including the benefit of tax subsidies and carbon-reduction incentives. As this project involves the conversion of an existing, operating process unit, Vertex anticipates that both the capital cost and anticipated time-to-market will be significantly less than that of comparable greenfield conversion projects.‚Äã

Also, here's what Alvaro Ruiz, EVP of Corporate Development at Vertex had to say:

""As part of this transaction, we plan to enter into a multi-year crude supply and product offtake agreements with several highly-respected counterparties, including Shell, who has been an exceptional partner throughout the sale process. We believe these agreements will position us to reduce our working capital requirements, while mitigating spot market risk on product sales. Upon closing, we expect to hedge a significant portion of the first-year production, reducing our near-term exposure to movements in refined product margins, as we focus on completing the planned asset conversion, which remains the most significant near-term economic driver resulting from this transaction.""

BIG NEWS BOYS AND GIRLS‚Äã
Most important√® piece of info, right here:‚§µÔ∏è


PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION: Vertex intends to enter into a multi-year product off-take agreement with Shell, while continuing to supply Bunker Holding (""Bunker One"") under an existing 10-year agreement. Under the agreements, Shell and Bunker One will purchase 100% of the Mobile refinery's conventional fuels production. Concurrent with this arrangement, Vertex will enter into a separate, long-term agreement under which Idemitsu Apollo Corporation, a wholly-owned California-based subsidiary of Idemitsu Kosan, will purchase 100% of the Mobile refinery's renewable diesel fuel production. The sale of all conventional and unconventional fuels will be priced against spot market index prices.‚Äã

Okay, whew, that was beginning to strain MY eyes.. Here's - to me, the best thing out of all this info and the best for our future as a cleaner environment: 

Renewable diesel is a biofuel that can be produced from organic waste and vegetable oils. Renewable diesel is a sustainable, fungible replacement for petroleum-based diesel fuel. While California remains the primary market for domestically produced renewable diesel, given the economic benefits for its use under the state's Low Carbon Fuel Standard, other states are expected to follow suit, creating significant, incremental demand during the next decade. Once operable, the Mobile refinery's converted hydrocracking unit will be capable of processing a wide range of organic, pre-treated feedstocks, including soybean and corn oil, meat tallow and waste vegetable oils, among others.‚Äã

[When we last left our hero,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrly28/the_legend_of_utheemperorofjenks_aka_ornamental/) he had just lost all of his rent money and what he could advance from credit cards on a failed Super Bowl bet, and a YOLO on ‚ÄúRhodium‚Äù that he ordered from a sketchy Slovakian Wish.com ripoff. Alas, it was, of course, fake, and he was broke and depressed. It might have been the first fatal case of autism. He thought to himself ‚ÄúAm I really that retarded?‚Äù Then, he realized ‚ÄúNo, it must be Oklahoma that‚Äôs retarded!‚Äù

So, [after a brief case of violent diarrhea from Oklahoma Grocery Store sushi](https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/lrslbb/psa_do_not_eat_grocery_store_sushi_right_now/), he was ready to hatch his plan! Uruguay! Yes, Uruguay. [He was going to move to Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lh5igx/c%C3%B3mo_se_puede_llegar_a_melo_desde_montevideo_sin/)

His plans for this move could‚Äôve been anyone‚Äôs guess. One possibility he inquired about was [how to be a Tea Blendmaster.](https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/lfga0m/how_does_one_become_a_blendmaster/) [Another was him possibly reconnecting with God.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/lsij6j/agnostic_jew_seeking_faith_in_god/) Yet, he seemed to be asking questions about another topic more often than the others...

[Bees.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lxcnt1/c%C3%B3mo_es_la_legalidad_de_la_apicultura_informal/)

Specifically, beekeeping, a topic he admitted he had no experience in, [as evident from him looking for any book on the subject as an introduction months before.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/)

What he planned on doing with the bees was anyone‚Äôs guess, and I doubt he thought it through that much either. One post **AFTER** he took possession of 200,000 bees (we‚Äôll get to that later,) was [asking Americans if there was a demand for mead in the states.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/) So, was he thinking of importing Uruguayan honey to the US to be made into mead? Was he going to make it himself? Did he move to another continent for no reason? Let‚Äôs all find out!

A little more than 2 months ago, he finally did it. [He moved to Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/m9ejpn/la_paloma/) And about a week after that, [he was driving a truck filled with 200k bees across his new country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/) Based on replies in that thread, he was aiming to have [a monopoly on beekeeping in the country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/gt48gke/) 

And for a while, things were kind ok for our young Autist. [He picked up his hives without complication.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mtkkf3/about_to_upsize_my_apiary_whats_the_best_layout/) [And then he settled into Melo, Uruguay, and set up his apiary ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/n1jnte/my_humble_apiary_near_melo_uruguay/). Life was good.

But, trouble was afoot. According to a reply, [the species he was planning on keeping had literally never been kept by keepers in Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mtkkf3/about_to_upsize_my_apiary_whats_the_best_layout/gv0viej/) And then, disaster struck. [He went to TIFU to post his tale of spreading an invasive species in an industry he knew nothing about.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/nmd69k/tifu_by_importing_bees_to_uruguay/)

Indeed, he had no idea even what a bee was until he stumbled his way through a book, and then decided to YOLO into honey in Uruguay. He somehow got in touch with an ecology professor in Montevideo that would help him set things up in exchange for grad students fucking with them every now and again. Oh, and the bees were from fucking Myanmar. Handshake agreement, of course. Total Chad move.

And like I said before, the rest went without incident for a while. It would take the bees ‚Äúa year‚Äù to make honey, so he just kinda hung out, stayed busy, and tried to find part time work in a foreign country he arrived in 2.5 months earlier.

And then, the professor ghosted him. Just disappeared. Shortly thereafter, government agents come out about this kid from Oklahoma illegally importing a non-native bee to their country. Apparently his bees had been fucking with other apiaries. So, he did probably the smartest thing he‚Äôs ever done.

He ran.

He fucking ran from the Uruguayan government, took a plane to LAX, and arrived with $14 to his name. His friend sent him $100, which wasn‚Äôt enough to go back to Oklahoma, so he took a $75 flight to Seattle, where he is also not from.

His last post is from a train out of the airport, with $39 to his name. I don‚Äôt know what is in store for him, but I know that $39 is as good as spent on urchin futures or whatever market he‚Äôs going to crash up there.

9785,,2021-05-28 03:12:37,t3_nmofz4,,wallstreetbets,"This started as a comment reply but I thought maybe people would like reading it. I've been researching Palantir since literally late November 2020 and I have nearly my entire portfolio in LEAPS expiring January 2023. So I have continually done more research on them this is just the basics to clear up confusion and help people who don't understand it because it's hard to hear all the hype and stuff. Also AMC to the moon tomorrow for my FDs I bought!! Don't judge me it's just fun to be in on the action on weeks like this.


So you should think of palantir as basically three companies and they actually are very far from unprofitable. 

They developed the really massive government software (gotham) specifically as a result of an interaction that happened to Peter Thiel while he was at paypal. They were losing millions to foreign scammers at paypal and the solution ended up being a high quality algorithm that flagged the most likely scam transactions and then allowed analysts to efficiently double check and verify the real scam transactions.

 It essentially was using what computers are efficient at (sorting through massive amounts of data) and then combining that with what humans are good at (looking at the more complex nuances that at least at that point computer algorithms were incapable of doing) and augmenting the humans ability to make complex decisions by rapidly sorting through the incoming data and bringing everything good to their attention.

They fixed paypals using this method and literally made the company profitable overnight because of fixing how much they were losing in the scam transactions. The FBI contacted PayPal and Thiel about using that initial software. That was literally his inspiration for what would become Palantir. He goes over it in huge detail in his book zero to one. If you make an audible account you can read it for free and find the chapter I'm talking about.

Then for 15 years they perfected the government software into the absolute nearly monopoly it is now in government intelligence augmentation software. The whole time though they reinvested almost everything for the last 10 years into building the commercial software (Foundry). That side of the business has only been live for a VERY short time and initially they literally didn't spend a single dollar on marketing their first commercial clients sought THEM out because of their insane reputation with the government. Foundry helps with supply chains and all kinds of other important data  insights. But if you want a recent example the NIH and the NHS both used Foundry to figure out how to best distribute the vaccine and vaccine distribution in the US and Britain has far outpaced expectations. You think commercial companies aren't going to be interested in using the software that was literally proven on a level like that?

 They're only just now adding huge amounts of people to their sales teams literally in the last six months which if you read Peter thiels book is insane for the stock because they have this crazy long term plan and he literally talks about how when they get to a certain point and start adding sales as a full sector of the company it means that is the company the company plans to BEGIN scaling. Meaning they're this big and they literally only just started on the scaling part. Which they've also said in tons of interviews if you're a die hard Palantirian like me. 



They actually also have the third side of the  business which is their actual like full AI for weaponization and war and defense for the government. Gotham is like helping analysts and commanders lead and even helping police or agents figure out what's going on. This other software is different. It's called Apollo and its only at the beginning too. It's like pure AI machine learning AI handles everything stuff. Go find a video called pentagon head of NSC briefs public on AI I think it's on the PBS channel on YouTube or some shit. Or you can listen to Joe Biden talk about how we're going to double our percentage of gdp spending on AI. The amount of government money that's going to go into AI as a weapon to compete with China DWARFS peoples expectations of how much large the market for the kind of software palantir makes is. 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201001005334/en/U.S.-Army-Research-Lab-Selects-Palantir-Technologies-Inc.-for-91M-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-Development

This is literally the backbone of everything AI that the government is about to invest in. Sure they're going to experiment with other research but if you do research you'll also find Palantir is the ONLY company that does anything remotely like this software that has anywhere near the kind of clearances like what is required for these contracts. They are currently a clearance level 5 and about to be the highest 6. The closest competitors are almost all a 3 or lower I'm not even sure if there's more than a single 4 and that stuff is crazy hard to get. 

But like again I'm an obsessive. I realize why people get so excited about the commercial side scaling and how it's very possible and can make them huge and it will. But I'm actually pretty sure the reason people like Cathy Wood has such a huge boner for them is that she realizes how MASSIVELY. And I mean MASSIVELY underestimated the amount of government revenue they will get from all this AI investing the United States and NATO are about to do. It's literally the next Manhattan project and they're absolutely going to be one of the biggest players developing it if not the biggest. I think it's funny because most people are pretty disinterested in the government stuff for Palantir but i really think the weaponized AI apollo stuff may be as big as anything could ever be. 




Also people got the insider selling stuff very very wrong. Tom Nash (love him or hate him I don't care) has a few really good recent videos where he explains it in basically full detail what was happening. The selling panicked a lot of retail investors during a time when the buying for growth markets had really slowed because of rate hike due to inflation scares and a ton of retail holders got scared and caused more selling and more people got scared because of that and sold and it really just was mass psychology in effect and a LOT of FUD and confusion. 

Basically a few executives karp in particular got billions of dollars worth of options that vest but literally expire so you have to exercise them which means you buy shares of the company at a strike price. Well because it's the company granting shares the strike price is literally 10 cents or something and these automatically have to vest at quarterly increments. So everytime karp was exercising he's actually buying shares. Like over 150 million in total maybe a lot more million SHARES not dollars. shares. And even those when he exercising he's buying shares technically from the company it ALL counts as profit on taxes and ITS NOT LONG TERM CAP GAINS ELIGIBLE. So over the last year plus this year he's essentially getting shares but the literal dollar value of those shares to the government counts as pure profit. So his total income which he's getting taxed at 40% of is in the BILLIONS yes billions. Because that's a lot to handle people that work for them actually automatically schedule sells of shares to cover the taxes so that there's no issue it's not even like him saying sell today and they do this.... TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INSIDER SELLING TO THE SEC. That's why it's automatically happening so no one can ever claim he's timing it. 

So listen cause here's where it gets important. The exercising of the shares counts as almost pure profits but remember he's receiving SHARES not dollars he doesn't actually get billions of dollars. So has to then sell SOME of the shares so he can pays taxes on that. Then when he sells the shares to pay the taxes for exercising he actually owes even more money if they went up from when he exercised. So everytime he's selling low its actually good for him because it's less ADDITIONAL PROFIT that he would owe taxes on.

 If he wasn't selling its because he thought it would go down even further and then he would actually owe less taxes overall. So if he thought it was going to tank he'd wait and actually get a nice fat discount on his taxes. 

I know this seems really crazy but I promise that's how it works you can look it up in detail but yeah shocking that mainstream media and redditors/youtubers who barely do research and have no real understanding of how these billion dollar compensations work would get it wrong. Unbelievable I know. If he had actually sold the massive overall percentage of his shares that some people claim he did the company would be at like $3-6 dollars not low 20s. Retail got confused because of market pressured due to interest rate fears from inflation and sold low (like retail always does) to institutions.",nmofz4,"Palantir DD if you want to understand company and it's history better (also insider ""selling"" explained in detail)"

What is Blue Apron?


Blue Apron (NYSE: APRN) was the forgotten step child, bad luck Brian, IPO of summer 2017 that priced below range and had the misfortune of debuting after Amazon bought Whole Foods. Since it‚Äôs debut, the stock has suffered dropping from nearly $150 per share (adjusted for a 2019 reverse-split necessitated to stay listed) to as low as approximately $2.00!


Why the Drop?


Management. Fucking. Sucked. The prior executive team essentially handed Chad Hello Fresh the keys to the kingdom, when they made the fatal error of betting that the ‚Äúhigh affinity core users‚Äù would be enough to sustain the business. For this reason, they cut marketing to nearly nothing and attempted to realize operating leverage by shrinking the customer base only to its most prolific buyers.

This was stupid. HelloFresh did the opposite, essentially giving away meals, and they used it to stockpile market share. Put a chart up of HelloFresh customers against Blue Apron. You‚Äôll see the two lines converge and a clear indication that HelloFresh stole most of their business. HelloFresh was one of the best trades of the past 5 years. Look at the chart, look at the sales, and look at the margins. They have managed to achieve operating leverage by employing affordable pricing and emphasizing retention.


Blue Apron Might Go Under....


Today the company is in a dire place. Languishing away in Micro Cap hell at an $80M market cap, no one on Wall Street wants to cover these guys. Only their bankers, CG and MS, write them research and neither are overly optimistic. They‚Äôre in a shit spot with a credit line that mandates they keep $15M cash at all times, and they keep their customer base above 300K (thus far, they‚Äôve struggled). They‚Äôre sitting on $29M and burn enough cash per Q that they might go below that $15M level (wouldn‚Äôt be a first). All signs are negative...


But I Think They Might Win


Blue Apron is under new management. Linda Kozlowski, is the former COO of ETSY and an ex-strategist at Alibaba. She believes HelloFresh did things right and she wants to right the ship. Her ballsy-ass plan is to ride the line on cash and go all in on customer growth. She realizes those customers are worth a lot more than income on the P&L, and that she needs to make the pot as big as she can. Thus far, it‚Äôs worked. Customers are up over 20% in the past two periods and retention rates are rising. We are seeing signs of operating leverage, and it opens a big possibility.


My Prediction

Management is buying shares. They know the company is not healthy. The only logic is that they have a plan that‚Äôs working. You can‚Äôt sell a dying business with a shrinking share, but you can certainly sell a growing community, that could be an accretive asset to a better capitalized entity. I think Linda is going either get the business in a position where it can refinance for better terms, or where it can be sold to create shareholder value via a strategic alternative.

If that happen, given this is priced for bankruptcy and ignored by the Street, the returns could easily reach the triple digits. I‚Äôm long and I plan to add on additional weakness.

Disclosure- I‚Äôm buying a stock that might go under. This is not advice! I‚Äôm stupid.",nmoit0,Blue Apron: Hero or Zero

Everyone is talking about how the squeeze didn't even happen and the shorts didn't cover yet. What I don't understand is why wouldn't that be possible? If short interest is 17%, so let's round up to about 100M shares. Today the volume traded was 700M shares. Couldn't 100M of those 700M have been the shorts covering? And if they didn't cover, today alone 700M shares were traded, why would 100M shares bought by shorts cause a squeeze if today 700M were traded?

I have been having this question for awhile, since I noticed the same with GME. In the days preceding January 28th (when GME reached its peak), the combined volume was several times the amount of float. How come the squeeze happened and why did it happen? If the volume was so high, couldn't the shorts have covered in the days preceding that?

I hope this makes sense and I really hope someone will be kind enough to explain a fellow retard who only knows about crayons what this all means.

Everything looked to have gone off successfully. We are now waiting on the data and craft to be analysed and inspected. This will take a few weeks according to Michael Colglazier.
That being said he had already outlined the test schedule in the earnings zoom call.

1st test flight - may 
2nd crewed flight - June 
3rd flight with R Branson on board late June/July 

4th flight this will be taking the Italian airforce on a training mission (600k a seat) late July


On the run in to the first test flight some possible maintenance issues appeared with the carrier plane White knight 2‚Ä¶. 
This indeed could have gone either way , after 2 weeks inspections it was decided that WK2 did not need to delay testing no maintenance was needed at this point. Scheduled Maintenance will commence in the fall after all tests have been completed.
Upon this news it is my opinion that the testing programme will go ahead as planned.

The market has responded accordingly and the stock is now up from $17-‚Ç¨31

Using Elliot wave theory we are probably at the end of the correction wave 4 and now began with the bullish wave 5.

9808,,2021-05-28 09:17:32,t3_nmtt43,,wallstreetbets,"Trainline has taken a huge dip since the UK government's announcement of the plan to nationalise the railway network. The plan includes creating an online ticketing platform by Great British Railways which might have a huge blow on Trainline revenue. However, this platform does not yet exist and will probably take a couple of years to develop. Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed.

In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales.  Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%.

I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time  for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

There is tons of support beyond this forum involving millions of people. Some people scalped the stock today before the 3 day weekend, so what. Honestly the same exact thing happened to GME before it exploded the following week (also a 3 day weekend). Short interest only increased. If anything this will only make the bear trap more dangerous.. The real party hasn't even started yet. You didn't see a massive sell-off AH. This thing is still live and hot. A lot of cynical people on here who act know better are going to look like fools once again (just like they did with GME). 

I could of sold for a profit today but didn't and will be loading up some more at the very beginning of next week. Bet you a lot of people who sold today are also coming back next week to push. This is just the beginning. It took a lot of dedicated people to get this far and you can bet your ass they will see this through if they haven't sold by now. Billions are at stake and those on the other side of this will try to discourage through all forms of manipulation over this long weekend. Chin up and stay the course.

There is tons of support beyond this forum involving millions of people. Some people scalped the stock today before the 3 day weekend, so what. Honestly the same exact thing happened to GME before it exploded the following week (also a 3 day weekend). Short interest only increased. If anything this will only make the bear trap more dangerous.. The real party hasn't even started yet. You didn't see a massive sell-off AH. This thing is still live and hot. A lot of cynical people on here who act know better are going to look like fools once again (just like they did with GME). 

I could of sold for a profit today but didn't and will be loading up some more at the very beginning of next week. Bet you a lot of people who sold today are also coming back next week to push. This is just the beginning. It took a lot of dedicated people to get this far and you can bet your ass they will see this through if they haven't sold by now. Billions are at stake and those on the other side of this will try to discourage through all forms of manipulation over this long weekend. Chin up and stay the course. You are on the right side of history. 

This goes beyond WSB

If youre gonna do MDMA with a hallucinogen, do like 50-80mg maximum. Any more will get you too adventurous and energetic which can be fun, but also lead to a lot of scenery changes. Changing scenery too frequently can really fuck up a good hallucinogenic experience.

A good 50mg MDMA + 2g mushroom can be really satisfying. I did before watching The Lorax in 3d in theaters and  I literally cried when they cut down the last tree.",,
