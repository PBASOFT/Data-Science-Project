What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season!

[**Anders Bylund**](https://boards.fool.com/profile/TMFZahrim/info.aspx) **(Nokia):** Few tech stocks have weathered the recent market storm quite like Finnish telecom infrastructure veteran Nokia. The stock has gained 32% since the New Year, including a 14% jump over the last 30 days. By contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is trading flat in 2021 and fell 7% in the last month.

This stock may feel like a joke due to the recent influx of Nokia interest from the Reddit-based WallStreetBets group, but that's just a coincidence. Nokia's real-world business prospects are solid and the stock is actually undervalued, even though it dodged the tech-stock market correction in recent months.

Nokia's solid market position was built on a foundation of [5G network](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) installations. Top-line sales are rising faster than expected, Nokia's profit margin is expanding as we speak thanks to the richer product mix, and the stock is changing hands for less than eight times free cash flow. You don't see that combination of deep-discount stock prices and robust business trends very often, and that makes Nokia a no-brainer buy right now.",ne3k42,Nokia an industry leader in the bargain bin

Home Depot reports earnings premarket 5/18. HD has beat earnings consistently and the share price has reacted negatively each time. In this market I feel like the play here is a strangle. My proposed play is the closest to the money strikes. Right now based on $324 list that would be the 5/21 323.5P/325C. You are in for about $1k. Break even is 3% in either direction. Of course we are hoping for 6% at least.

November earnings was a beat and the stock dropped 6% that day. That would be 100% profit with the trade I propose for educational purposes only. The previous report had a -3.2% drop that day which would still print.

Here is the kicker. The 5 day high is $344 (5/10) and low $317 (5/12) for a 2 day swing of 8.4% bases on Friday close. This is key because it means there is the potential for both sides of the strangle to be profitable prior to expiration! Nuts right?

Here is how to play it. Watch the housing report tomorrow (5/17). With lumber prices being insane new construction might be a miss. If HD stock goes down you will need to consider if the market will price this in when digesting an earnings miss. You will want to wait until the end of the day to enter the strangle to make sure you have strikes that put the Monday close in the middle.

If earnings are a beat and the prices goes up >3% sell the call once you are happy with the profit. Lock in your tuition money because again, this is for education. Same goes for the inverse. Then you have until Friday to try to get tendies with the other side. Can't remember the Vince Vaughn line from Dodge ball but it think it's ""that's what we call the jackpot"".

Not WSB material you say? Earnings plays are inherently gambling and sir, this is a casino.

Positions: none yet. Ask me at 3PM tomorrow you illiterate ape.

TLDR: Home Depot is usually located in  very close proximity to a Wendy's = tendies.

I‚Äôm a bull here for technical reasons. However, the fundamentals make sense here now as well. The current bull-market trendlines on all the reopen stonks started with a vaccine announcement on November 9th in the early A.M. (the freaking insiders bought/drove up prices before the market opened, that sucked).

The CDC letting ‚Äúvaccinated‚Äù people stop social distancing has majorly positive implications for the economy. Think of traveling, think of the impeding Memorial Day weekend...

Go check out the 1-year, 1-day charts for these stocks, and draw a line from the close on November 6th to now. I think we see 30% or more gains in the value of these stocks the next couple weeks.

I  have shared my thoughts on UWMC in past. The company announced Q1  earnings and while they look like they are below expectations it was  explained by the CEO that because of the speed of their execution, their  results are reflective of the higher rate environment already while  competitors are lagged.

During    the Q4 2020 earnings call he  had mused about options that would be on    the stable, special dividend,  buyback or raising the dividend.

**Feb Q4 Earnings Quote:**

The     Board did approve a dividend, a $0.10 quarterly dividend to be  paid    on  April 6 for all shareholders of record as of March 10. **We expect  this to be a regular quarterly dividend**.

And     so you guys know how we're thinking about this. Our balance sheet   is  a   fortress. And our current liquidity position is very strong, and    we   have access to the capital markets as well. The way we think  about   this   going forward is we're producing a lot of cash. We're  going to   maybe   be more profitable than some expected and be very  successful in   2021.   And **if we have excess cash that I and the Board deem is too much,  we will be delivering that back**. And whether we have to **change     the  dividend in the future, as in raise it or a special dividend,     those  things are definitely on the table or even buying back shares**.

**May Q1 Earnings Quote:**

As     you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of      $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a      record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I always  **explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special  dividend or a share buyback program**. As you guys have seen, we **concluded      share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward   shareholders.    We announced the authorization of $300 million share   buyback over the    next 24 months**.  And **quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that**.

**Then in answering a question from an analyst**

Doug    Harter -  Great. And then just in terms of capital return, you    mentioned sort of  the float. I  guess just how are you thinking about    kind of **how much of  the float  you'd be willing to take out and pacing around share  repurchase**?

Mat Ishbia -  Yes, Doug. So I'm learning these rules as we go **because at this stock  price, I'm a buyer, right**?    And so we'll buy shares as soon as tomorrow, I  think, as our legal    teams say we're allowed to do. And so I don't know  how many I can buy    and what I can do, but I'm very conscientious of the  float.  If the    float was not a concern, **we'd be more aggressive**. However,  **we     have authorization from the Board to buy up to $300 million, and I'm      going to take advantage of that opportunity while being  conscientious     of our partners in the float.**

TL/DR:     UWMC and their board have been looking at ways to give back to     shareholders. Instead of a short term cash out, they decided on a     buyback that they are planning to exercise immediately on so that they     can retire shares while the SP is low. They will NOT buy so much that   it   will ruin their float % for Russell. The CEO is aggressive, has    approval to spend $300 and he's going to take FULL advantage.  The CEO has stated he is a BUYER! They are  not   waiting, it's being deployed now.

If we can open above 6.9 (50day SMA) I think we can close around that 7.14 (200day SMA) level which should line us up for that move out of the $6-$8 range and into the $10s and beyond.

Now funny enough what actually has me the most bullish this morning is looking at Friday alone. Selling pressure was suppressed by the bulls and it closed right near HOD above all major resistances.

* 60 and 120 SMMAs need to hold or we w could try to fill the gap at 322 - 320
* I expect some support at top of gap fill area - 322
* Bulls need to hold 323-322
* Majore support 317
* Major resistance at 326.9

Has anyone noticed how few movies are being released this year? Or how, many fewer movies are even going through theaters now that direct-to-consumer has been achieved by the studios? This may indeed be the end of theaters. 

Most households have damn near cinema quality setups. 7.1 surround sound, 4K displays, much better seating and obviously better snacks. Unless they let us smoke weed in the theaters .. how are they gonna recover?

And why isn't anyone talking about the abolishment of the 1948 Paramount antitrust laws?

If you‚Äôre holding your positions at ATHs, with a lot of downside risk to the nearest support, then it‚Äôs probably time to be defensive.  Either sell, buy some cheap puts, or sell some calls against your position.   

Same with entering the trade, if you‚Äôre just popping in and buying, with little care about placement, then you‚Äôre gonna get wrecked over the long run.

And 23.9% of the EV market in Europe 2019-2020, more than just ""viable"". I think the word you're looking for is evidently successful.  


""But saying that they first released BEVs 3-5 decades ago isn‚Äôt making the point you think it is. Keep it up tho""  


It's actually making precisely the point I think it is. Tesla *isn't* the first in this market, rather there are a huge range of rivals who realised that the infastructure for EVs didn't exist 2-5 decades ago and instead invested in HEVs and PHEVs which meant that they were still investing in battery technology but combining it with ICE to give it the versatility that was necessary. 

Pretending that legacy companies have been unnecessarily slow or unwilling to to change is fatuous and false. It might apply to some, but it doesn't apply to huge chunks of the industry. As someone who lives in Europe all I've heard about is innovation and invention in the green automobile space for the past two decades. Hybrids were clearly the better product up until very, very recently.",,

Glacier Capital exists. That sentence isn't going to make me any friends, but your wallet needs to hear it. They've even written some insightful pieces which panned out as per the analyses; CVNA (link below) performed well in the short-term as predicted, but the majority shareholder and CEO sold practically all of his shares four days ago, al in line with their poor long-term outlook.

[http://glaciercapital.lu/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/This-Time-is-not-Different-LP-August-2019.pdf](http://glaciercapital.lu/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/This-Time-is-not-Different-LP-August-2019.pdf)

A lot of the theorising focuses on the founding year of the company. Look... the profile on Bloomberg is for a different Glacier Capital LLC. There appear to be quite a few Glacier Capital LLCs. In the US, LLC names are not unique on a federal level. Unrelated companies in different states can have exactly the same name.

When we consider that the CEO of *the* Glacier Capital was still a university student in 2005, we can safely conclude this isn't a smoking gun and it's likely we're tripping up over unrelated companies.

What does this mean for the short. Is it a bluff? Are billionaires phoning each other and bribing journos to falsify the existence of hedge funds? Idk, I'm just a sleep-deprived dickhead on stimmies who is concerned that someone on his second sunrise in one sleep cycle is exercising more calm and reason than people with 100x my net worth.

Look at the dates. When the whole GME surge was first kicking off, Glacier Capital filed to register for a 'Legal Entity Identifier' (LEI) in order to comply with 'Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II' (MiFID II), which was a tightening of regulations within the EU in 2008. LEIs are required in order to comply with MiFID II, and MiFID II needs to be complied with in order to carry out certain high risk activities, including forms/scales of derivatives.

I am not a European financial services lawyer but considering the timing of everything, it seems reasonable to assume that the short positions may be real - and if new certs were put in place just for one series of positions, then it isn't crazy to think they might be especially large.

Again, *I am not saying* that this isn't an incestuous industry or that the capital isn't coming from known players. I am specifically begging you not to be a fucking dumbfuck because of one Reddit-cum-Sherlock post so that whatever dumbass decision you make next is at least a little less erratic. I've been holding since January, I'm not telling you not to buy GME, this is not FUD. Just don't be allergic to facts. Know your risks.",nf5m0v,"""Glacier Capital"" DOES exist.

[**Anders Bylund**](https://boards.fool.com/profile/TMFZahrim/info.aspx) **(Nokia):** Few tech stocks have weathered the recent market storm quite like Finnish telecom infrastructure veteran Nokia. The stock has gained 32% since the New Year, including a 14% jump over the last 30 days. By contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is trading flat in 2021 and fell 7% in the last month.

This stock may feel like a joke due to the recent influx of Nokia interest from the Reddit-based WallStreetBets group, but that's just a coincidence. Nokia's real-world business prospects are solid and the stock is actually undervalued, even though it dodged the tech-stock market correction in recent months.

Nokia's solid market position was built on a foundation of [5G network](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) installations. Top-line sales are rising faster than expected, Nokia's profit margin is expanding as we speak thanks to the richer product mix, and the stock is changing hands for less than eight times free cash flow. You don't see that combination of deep-discount stock prices and robust business trends very often, and that makes Nokia a no-brainer buy right now.",ne3k42,Nokia an industry leader in the bargain bin

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

&nbsp;

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, and checking out my socials, it would mean a lot to me! **Happy Trading Everybody! :)**",ne1fla,"Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation (Week 5) - $HD, $WMT, $TGT, $LOW, $CSCO, $GOEV, $XL, $SE and More"

You don't need to be a genius to see that TSLA is overvalued as hell. To justify it's current price today (even long after dipping from $900), it would need to sell all the cars sold throughout the world for several years.

Retards will counter this with ""iT's NoT jUsT a CaR cOmPaNy"", but it is. They buy their batteries, they buy their solar panels, they only build the car, and according to the many bad reports, they don't service them well.

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season!

[**Anders Bylund**](https://boards.fool.com/profile/TMFZahrim/info.aspx) **(Nokia):** Few tech stocks have weathered the recent market storm quite like Finnish telecom infrastructure veteran Nokia. The stock has gained 32% since the New Year, including a 14% jump over the last 30 days. By contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is trading flat in 2021 and fell 7% in the last month.

This stock may feel like a joke due to the recent influx of Nokia interest from the Reddit-based WallStreetBets group, but that's just a coincidence. Nokia's real-world business prospects are solid and the stock is actually undervalued, even though it dodged the tech-stock market correction in recent months.

Nokia's solid market position was built on a foundation of [5G network](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) installations. Top-line sales are rising faster than expected, Nokia's profit margin is expanding as we speak thanks to the richer product mix, and the stock is changing hands for less than eight times free cash flow. You don't see that combination of deep-discount stock prices and robust business trends very often, and that makes Nokia a no-brainer buy right now.",ne3k42,Nokia an industry leader in the bargain bin

Home Depot reports earnings premarket 5/18. HD has beat earnings consistently and the share price has reacted negatively each time. In this market I feel like the play here is a strangle. My proposed play is the closest to the money strikes. Right now based on $324 list that would be the 5/21 323.5P/325C. You are in for about $1k. Break even is 3% in either direction. Of course we are hoping for 6% at least.

November earnings was a beat and the stock dropped 6% that day. That would be 100% profit with the trade I propose for educational purposes only. The previous report had a -3.2% drop that day which would still print.

Here is the kicker. The 5 day high is $344 (5/10) and low $317 (5/12) for a 2 day swing of 8.4% bases on Friday close. This is key because it means there is the potential for both sides of the strangle to be profitable prior to expiration! Nuts right?

Here is how to play it. Watch the housing report tomorrow (5/17). With lumber prices being insane new construction might be a miss. If HD stock goes down you will need to consider if the market will price this in when digesting an earnings miss. You will want to wait until the end of the day to enter the strangle to make sure you have strikes that put the Monday close in the middle.

If earnings are a beat and the prices goes up >3% sell the call once you are happy with the profit. Lock in your tuition money because again, this is for education. Same goes for the inverse. Then you have until Friday to try to get tendies with the other side. Can't remember the Vince Vaughn line from Dodge ball but it think it's ""that's what we call the jackpot"".

Not WSB material you say? Earnings plays are inherently gambling and sir, this is a casino.

Positions: none yet. Ask me at 3PM tomorrow you illiterate ape.

TLDR: Home Depot is usually located in  very close proximity to a Wendy's = tendies.

I  have shared my thoughts on UWMC in past. The company announced Q1  earnings and while they look like they are below expectations it was  explained by the CEO that because of the speed of their execution, their  results are reflective of the higher rate environment already while  competitors are lagged.

During    the Q4 2020 earnings call he  had mused about options that would be on    the stable, special dividend,  buyback or raising the dividend.

**Feb Q4 Earnings Quote:**

The     Board did approve a dividend, a $0.10 quarterly dividend to be  paid    on  April 6 for all shareholders of record as of March 10. **We expect  this to be a regular quarterly dividend**.

And     so you guys know how we're thinking about this. Our balance sheet   is  a   fortress. And our current liquidity position is very strong, and    we   have access to the capital markets as well. The way we think  about   this   going forward is we're producing a lot of cash. We're  going to   maybe   be more profitable than some expected and be very  successful in   2021.   And **if we have excess cash that I and the Board deem is too much,  we will be delivering that back**. And whether we have to **change     the  dividend in the future, as in raise it or a special dividend,     those  things are definitely on the table or even buying back shares**.

**May Q1 Earnings Quote:**

As     you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of      $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a      record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I always  **explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special  dividend or a share buyback program**. As you guys have seen, we **concluded      share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward   shareholders.    We announced the authorization of $300 million share   buyback over the    next 24 months**.  And **quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that**.

**Then in answering a question from an analyst**

Doug    Harter -  Great. And then just in terms of capital return, you    mentioned sort of  the float. I  guess just how are you thinking about    kind of **how much of  the float  you'd be willing to take out and pacing around share  repurchase**?

Mat Ishbia -  Yes, Doug. So I'm learning these rules as we go **because at this stock  price, I'm a buyer, right**?    And so we'll buy shares as soon as tomorrow, I  think, as our legal    teams say we're allowed to do. And so I don't know  how many I can buy    and what I can do, but I'm very conscientious of the  float.  If the    float was not a concern, **we'd be more aggressive**. However,  **we     have authorization from the Board to buy up to $300 million, and I'm      going to take advantage of that opportunity while being  conscientious     of our partners in the float.**

TL/DR:     UWMC and their board have been looking at ways to give back to     shareholders. Instead of a short term cash out, they decided on a     buyback that they are planning to exercise immediately on so that they     can retire shares while the SP is low. They will NOT buy so much that   it   will ruin their float % for Russell. The CEO is aggressive, has    approval to spend $300 and he's going to take FULL advantage.  The CEO has stated he is a BUYER! They are  not   waiting, it's being deployed now.

Disclosure I am still in long position with 25K  at 8.39 USD shares of UWMC

I mean another theory could also be that by acquiring xilinx, that growth factor that was built into AMD is gone. xilinx is about half the size of AMD and grows A LOT slower.

And then the benefits of the merger may not be seen as quickly. i.e. you don't just merge and suddenly start spitting out chips designed together. you're looking at probably a 3-5 year horizon before anythiing fruitful comes out of the merger, which is 3-5 years of lower growth of the combined company than what AMD was experiencing. And as with all mergers, the question still remains, will the sum of the parts actually be greater than the parts of the sum. (IOW is 1+1=3?).

and then to cap it all off, NQ is up 1% ytd (granted AMD is down 20% but that is also partially due to lackluster 4Q 2020).",,

MGM

AMZN looking buying MGM HOLDINGS (A studio company)- NOT a public company

It is NOT MGM the casinos-Public Company

They are 2 separate  companies and have no relationship

If you buy MGM (which I own and think is a good buy) you ARE NOT getting in front of that potential sale. It is meaningless to them

It's not even easy to search for cause the casino MGM overwhelms the results

Everything you read will improve your understanding, even if it's bad advice. People will have vested interests in one position or the other and especially here may not be straight up with their intentions. So.... yeah, it's tricky but definitely don't take decisions solely on this sub's recommendation!

2) You misunderstood my comment. Nuance is comparative.

[**Anders Bylund**](https://boards.fool.com/profile/TMFZahrim/info.aspx) **(Nokia):** Few tech stocks have weathered the recent market storm quite like Finnish telecom infrastructure veteran Nokia. The stock has gained 32% since the New Year, including a 14% jump over the last 30 days. By contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is trading flat in 2021 and fell 7% in the last month.

This stock may feel like a joke due to the recent influx of Nokia interest from the Reddit-based WallStreetBets group, but that's just a coincidence. Nokia's real-world business prospects are solid and the stock is actually undervalued, even though it dodged the tech-stock market correction in recent months.

Nokia's solid market position was built on a foundation of [5G network](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) installations. Top-line sales are rising faster than expected, Nokia's profit margin is expanding as we speak thanks to the richer product mix, and the stock is changing hands for less than eight times free cash flow. You don't see that combination of deep-discount stock prices and robust business trends very often, and that makes Nokia a no-brainer buy right now.",ne3k42,Nokia an industry leader in the bargain bin

Home Depot reports earnings premarket 5/18. HD has beat earnings consistently and the share price has reacted negatively each time. In this market I feel like the play here is a strangle. My proposed play is the closest to the money strikes. Right now based on $324 list that would be the 5/21 323.5P/325C. You are in for about $1k. Break even is 3% in either direction. Of course we are hoping for 6% at least.

November earnings was a beat and the stock dropped 6% that day. That would be 100% profit with the trade I propose for educational purposes only. The previous report had a -3.2% drop that day which would still print.

Here is the kicker. The 5 day high is $344 (5/10) and low $317 (5/12) for a 2 day swing of 8.4% bases on Friday close. This is key because it means there is the potential for both sides of the strangle to be profitable prior to expiration! Nuts right?

Here is how to play it. Watch the housing report tomorrow (5/17). With lumber prices being insane new construction might be a miss. If HD stock goes down you will need to consider if the market will price this in when digesting an earnings miss. You will want to wait until the end of the day to enter the strangle to make sure you have strikes that put the Monday close in the middle.

If earnings are a beat and the prices goes up >3% sell the call once you are happy with the profit. Lock in your tuition money because again, this is for education. Same goes for the inverse. Then you have until Friday to try to get tendies with the other side. Can't remember the Vince Vaughn line from Dodge ball but it think it's ""that's what we call the jackpot"".

Not WSB material you say? Earnings plays are inherently gambling and sir, this is a casino.

Positions: none yet. Ask me at 3PM tomorrow you illiterate ape.

TLDR: Home Depot is usually located in  very close proximity to a Wendy's = tendies.

MGM, NCLH, BA, BP are my picks. Each from a different industry, positively impacted by the reopening and ensuing pent-up demand of the economy. I‚Äôm swinging for the MIL on this! 

I‚Äôm a bull here for technical reasons. However, the fundamentals make sense here now as well. The current bull-market trendlines on all the reopen stonks started with a vaccine announcement on November 9th in the early A.M.

The CDC letting ‚Äúvaccinated‚Äù people stop social distancing has majorly positive implications for the economy. Think of traveling, think of the impeding Memorial Day weekend...

Go check out the 1-year, 1-day charts for these stocks, and draw a line from the close on November 6th to now. I think we see 30% or more gains in the value of these stocks the next couple weeks.

I  have shared my thoughts on UWMC in past. The company announced Q1  earnings and while they look like they are below expectations it was  explained by the CEO that because of the speed of their execution, their  results are reflective of the higher rate environment already while  competitors are lagged.

During    the Q4 2020 earnings call he  had mused about options that would be on    the stable, special dividend,  buyback or raising the dividend.

**Feb Q4 Earnings Quote:**

The     Board did approve a dividend, a $0.10 quarterly dividend to be  paid    on  April 6 for all shareholders of record as of March 10. **We expect  this to be a regular quarterly dividend**.

And     so you guys know how we're thinking about this. Our balance sheet   is  a   fortress. And our current liquidity position is very strong, and    we   have access to the capital markets as well. The way we think  about   this   going forward is we're producing a lot of cash. We're  going to   maybe   be more profitable than some expected and be very  successful in   2021.   And **if we have excess cash that I and the Board deem is too much,  we will be delivering that back**. And whether we have to **change     the  dividend in the future, as in raise it or a special dividend,     those  things are definitely on the table or even buying back shares**.

**May Q1 Earnings Quote:**

As     you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of      $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a      record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I always  **explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special  dividend or a share buyback program**. As you guys have seen, we **concluded      share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward   shareholders.    We announced the authorization of $300 million share   buyback over the    next 24 months**.  And **quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that**.

**Then in answering a question from an analyst**

Doug    Harter -  Great. And then just in terms of capital return, you    mentioned sort of  the float. I  guess just how are you thinking about    kind of **how much of  the float  you'd be willing to take out and pacing around share  repurchase**?

Mat Ishbia -  Yes, Doug. So I'm learning these rules as we go **because at this stock  price, I'm a buyer, right**?    And so we'll buy shares as soon as tomorrow, I  think, as our legal    teams say we're allowed to do. And so I don't know  how many I can buy    and what I can do, but I'm very conscientious of the  float.  If the    float was not a concern, **we'd be more aggressive**. However,  **we     have authorization from the Board to buy up to $300 million, and I'm      going to take advantage of that opportunity while being  conscientious     of our partners in the float.**

TL/DR:     UWMC and their board have been looking at ways to give back to     shareholders. Instead of a short term cash out, they decided on a     buyback that they are planning to exercise immediately on so that they     can retire shares while the SP is low. They will NOT buy so much that   it   will ruin their float % for Russell. The CEO is aggressive, has    approval to spend $300 and he's going to take FULL advantage.  The CEO has stated he is a BUYER! They are  not   waiting, it's being deployed now.

Disclosure I am still in long position with 25K  at 8.39 USD shares of UWMC

Stochastic's oversold and the RSI is closely following. On a shorter time frame we can see that bulls finished the Friday session off strong positioning us in a nice spot technically as we are sitting on the 20day SMA.

If we can open above 6.9 (50day SMA) I think we can close around that 7.14 (200day SMA) level which should line us up for that move out of the $6-$8 range and into the $10s and beyond.

Now funny enough what actually has me the most bullish this morning is looking at Friday alone. Selling pressure was suppressed by the bulls and it closed right near HOD above all major resistances.

UWMC is ready to pop!

I was in UWMC for the value play. It is a STEAL at 10$ on fundamentals anything below that is an insane deal. Even above 10 has a strong long-term argument.

Here is UWMC in a nutshell: heavily shorted, borrow costs skyrocketing, mortgage industry hit overly hard on fears of rising interest rates, the CEO Ishiba announces a 300M stock buyback, and shorts are QUAKING. UP 6% in premarket following being up 1-2% Friday. This puts at starting at $8 Monday with $9 being a CRITICAL Friday target for us.

All UWMC needs is a little unexpected retail buying pressure and it POPS! In truth this is not just a short squeeze, its multiple plays rolled into one. We have retail buying hype train going (obviously, look at all the WSB posts here posted below), short-squeeze due to high cost of borrow, Gamma squeeze due to the MASSIVE options interest, 300M stock buyback by CEO to scare off the shorts, an unfair post-earnings plunge, plus good-ole\` company doing good things (making money).

We coming back for some of our loyal bagholders that have been holding UWMC since the last train to $14, hey guys remember to take profit this time ;)

**üöÄ** **üöÄ** **üöÄ** **üöÄ** **üöÄ** UWMC **üöÄ** **üöÄ** **üöÄ** **üöÄ** **üöÄ** **üöÄ** **üöÄShort Squeeze**.Short borrow costs skyrocketed from 30% to over 93% in a few hours on Friday: They cannot keep shorting at this price. It is now cost-prohibitive to use more shorts to keep the price low. The normal dirty tricks triple in price so become less-used. Shorts use this borrow price to determine feasibility and 93% is obviously unfeasible, THEY WILL COVER. Once one group starts covering and causes a spike, other shorts will rush to do the same.

It's a prisoner's dilemma and HF's want to cut each other's throats just as much as ours. Let's let them!!!

Many of these 7.50,9. 10, and 12 are OTM or barely ITM. and an early week spike to put 9c ITM would force MM's to hedge to delta-neutral...further pushing 10c and 12.50 c into hedge territory. This can quickly cause things to spiral out of control for shorts.

Stock BuyBack,

Ishbia is going to war with the shorts and his weapon of choice is a 300M stock buyback (similar to RKT's special dividend for the same purpose). The buyback could have started happening as early as May 11th.

Most of the float is owned by institutions and insiders so this buyback puts increased pressure of a heavily shorted (13%+) and heavily held float pool.

Retail is gorging on the float, institutions are holding the float, and Ishbia is buying the free float up. This is a recipe for ROCKET FUEL. WIth shorts paying 93%, they will stop shorting so the shares we are buying are REAL, not synthetic.

Make them buy real shares, from us, at 20$ each.

I am in UWMC for the long-term VALUE-PLAY and like the stock. I like the company., I like the CEO. I like the market position. I like the value. I ilke the stock.

I am loading up on 6/18 8c options. Options are important as we move up to force MM's to buy to remain market neutral.

Options do not pay unless we buy shares, so I suggest splitting half/half to each. options can cause MM's to balance risk and lead to large upswings but this cannot happen without buying pressure and the underlying spiking to necessitate balancing risk, which means we need to buy stocks as well.

Options are good for Gamma Squeeze/MM's balance buys (and profit) but shares are needed to keep the underlying JOOSED and keep those options deep ITM.

MIX IT UP!

This is the final call for the UWMC tendie train so get your fucking tickets and remember; Gravy costs extra,

1717,,2021-05-17 13:20:55,t3_neg3ey,,wallstreetbets,"$UWMC has become one of the most hyped stocks in the online investment community. Online activity appears to be ramping up after earnings and heading into May 21st option expiries. Since UWM is getting a lot of new eyes, it seemed like an appropriate time to share why some investors may consider UWM as a long term hold. 

UWM is a mortgage company that focuses exclusively on the broker channel. It‚Äôs the largest wholesale mortgage provider in the US and the second largest mortgage originator, behind Rocket Companies. 

It‚Äôs CEO is Mat Ishbia, who started as it‚Äôs 12th employee and who‚Äôs dad, Jeff, started the company as a side hustle. Mat and his brother own 94% of the company in Class D shares. The rest of the public float, \~100m Class A shares, are what is available for the public to purchase. 

# What trends are pushing $UWMC‚Äôs stock down? 

**The largest threat UWM is facing is raising interest rates**: 

About 75% of UWM income is related to refinance activity. The pandemic pushed rates to historic lows so most consumers were better off refinancing. Millions have done that, leading to record profit for mortgage providers like UWM and Rocket. 

**The strength of the broker channel:**

UWM is completely dependent on brokers finding business and closing loans. It doesn‚Äôt have any direct-to-consumer lending operations like Rocket does. 

**Short Interest:** 

Sophisticated investors are seeing 75% of income potentially attached to rate sensitive products (not all refi‚Äôs are rate sensitive like cash out), and are salivating. They think the market is under appreciating this headwind and shorting the stock. They have basically shorted all the shares they can. Friday the stock ended with 200 shares available and an insane 93% borrow rate. 

**SPAC:**

It is true that the SPAC market has softened recently. It is very reasonable to assume $UWMC is a part of that softening. It may not attract institutional investors because of the SPAC situation and the short period it has been publicly traded. Lots of other nice places to put institutional money.

**Competitors:** Mortgages are a mature market and competition is fierce. Rocket, LoanDepot and UWM mentioned a pricing war in their earnings. (LD statement). This will compress loan sale margins in the short term. 

**What trends are pushing $UWMC stock up?** 

**Short term retail pressure:**

there is a lot of retail attention on the potential short squeeze/gamma squeeze you could see this week in UWMC. My post is about UWM‚Äôs long term perspective, so I‚Äôll let [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ndcm0p/uwmc_is_a_powderkeg_low_float_high_short_huge/) take you further down that rabbit hole. Additionally, smart money is now tracking online sentiment, which can lead to increased institutional purchases. 

**Broker Channel Growth:** Mat has claimed two reasons for taking UWM public. He wanted access to the liquidity market and marketing exposure for the broker channel. For UWM to become the largest mortgage originator, Mat has targeted ‚Öì mortgages to be originated by brokers and UWM to own 50% of that channel by 2025/26. Currently UWM owns 36% of the broker channel with brokers originating 20% of all mortgages. Before the housing crisis in 2008, brokers were 58% of mortgage originations (Per Mat & Q1 2021 Earnings call), so it isn‚Äôt crazy to think they could get back to ‚Öì as it is growing: [https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum](https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum)

I had a loan with Rocket and tried to refinance with them. I then went through a mortgage broker and got the same loan for $4.5k cheaper in closing costs. This is because Rocket‚Äôs retail channel has 4% margins and it‚Äôs partnership network (includes wholesale, realtors, etc.) has 1% margins. 

**New Product Offerings:** 

UWM recently released new products like their jumbo loan. In earnings, Mat said he expects $2b in volume from Jumbo. They also added ARM‚Äôs, manufactured homes and expanded government programs. 

**Wholesale mortgage provider consolidation:** 

Mat said 3 of the top 25 wholesale lenders have been purchased in the last 90 days. This type of consolidation happens in mature markets by companies that are reaching for market share. THis could be a sign companies are under pressure to grow but cannot organically get market share from UWM. 

**UWM ‚ÄúAll In‚Äù Ultimatum:** 

Rocket and Fairway are priortizing other channels (cause the margins are so much higher) and trying to squeeze out brokers. UWM said if you work with those two, don‚Äôt work for us. The goal was to stand up for the broker channel WHILE putting some pressure on Rocket and Fairway‚Äôs partnership channel. This may have kickstarted the pricing war. 

**Aggressive Capital returns:** 

UWM pays an annual .40 dividend on its class A shares. That only costs them \~$42m/year. Remember their Q1 net income was $800m+. So their dividends hardly affect the balance sheet. The board just approved a $300/million share buyback as well that will reduce share count. Mat knows a thing or two about shorting stocks. He just sold at $10 and has authority to buy back with the current price under $8. The man successfully shorted his own company. What a legend. 

**Long Term Prediction:** 

I‚Äôm invested in UWM because I believe the capital returns will be aggressive during the upswing and the company will remain profitable in a downturn. With a 5%+ dividend return, share buyback, and \*potentially\* growing market share, UWM could be primed to overtake Rocket within the next few years.

1721,,2021-05-17 14:45:52,t3_nei5qk,,wallstreetbets,"As the cloud & big data continues to grow, as well as social media & 4k/8k video, data storage is becoming more important than ever.

Large social media sites take in a tremendous amount of data each day. This storage must not only be stored, but stored with redundancy as well as backups. Major sites such as Facebook and YouTube keep content that is over a decade old. Over time, the drives holding this content will fail and need to be replaced, leading to growing recurring demand as the size of the platform grows.

The need for storage has been growing for decades, but innovation in storage density and intense competition has limited profitability in the market in the past. That being said, there is reason to believe that the growth in storage density may stop keeping up with the growth in storage needs.

There is also reason to believe that transient growth in storage demand may drive higher Q2 earnings. A new digital currency, Chia, has gobbled up about 6 Exabytes worth of storage in the past 3 weeks, now growing at a rate of about 0.4 EiB per day(and rising). https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/netspace

For reference, about 288 Exabytes worth of hard drives were shipped in Q1 2021 https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hdd-shipments-in-q1-2021

Chia network size can be considered a lagging indicator for unexpected drive shipments. Generally, it can take a few weeks between when a drive is purchased and when it's actually accounted for on the network, as it takes time for it to be shipped, set up, and plotted. Chia wasn't even listed on exchanges until a couple weeks ago, so most of the growth seen is prior to Chia even having a price. At current prices, mining is incredibly profitable, with a $500 14 TB drive estimated to produce about $26 per day, and using very little power. So even if the network grows 10x to 60 Exabytes, it's still producing $3/day at current prices. So expect the surge in demand to continue.

I have seen many anecdotes of drive shortages over the past couple weeks. Reviewing sites like Amazon, I have also seen high capacity drives go out of stock or require lead times of a few weeks.

This may be a bit reminiscent of GPU shortages among Nvidia and AMD as miners seek to buy up anything they can.

If we project continued growth at 0.4 Exabytes a day in unexpected demand from proof of storage over the next 40 days, plus the 6 Exabytes added since April 20(leaving out first 3 weeks in quarter as they were likely logged last quarter), that's about 22 Exabytes to be added in Q2 that are not part of normal usage, or about an extra ~8% of Q1 demand.

What's perhaps most interesting is the impact this could have on margins. Unlike the GPUs used to mine which are consumer devices, the devices used for mining Chia includes enterprise grade hardware. Prices in the drive market are more flexible at the manufacturer level, and currently have much lower margins. If proof of storage currencies cause a drive shortage, it could have a significant impact on margins. Western digital sells about 40% of its drives through distributors, Seagate about 30%. Sales through these channels generally are very responsive to demand trends in terms of prices.

Seagate is also in a position to profit from this, but I'm a bit more worried about them as hard drive shipments have been on a long term decline and they aren't diversified into SSDs/flash like Western Digital is.

1726,,2021-05-17 16:06:02,t3_nek6rk,,wallstreetbets,"Hi all, going to keep this short as there is already some great DD on Myovant Sciences out there on Reddit and some recent articles, plus I‚Äôm not a financial advisor.

The EMA (EU medical agency like FDA) announced Myovant and Relugolix as up for review to be accepted for Marketing approval in the EU this week. This is a huge catalyst in the biotech industry, and due to their Pfizer partnership this could result in a 50m cash payment to Myovant as well.

They also have an FDA PDUFA deadline of June 1 for a second application (their first of three was approved in December). If approved this would result in a 100m cash payment from Pfizer.

Alone, these are major catalysts. Right now they stand to go back to back on these catalysts. The last time the company had one catalyst like this, **they were rocketed past $30 a share and gained a strategic partnership from Pfizer.**

Now those are two major catalysts within two weeks, **if FDA decides early, both could happen this week.**

Due to the triple threat data put up in clinical trials and the fact that they had this data peer reviewed and published in the New England journal of medicine, there is strong confidence of approval on the company‚Äôs end.

Last but not least, they have additional catalysts still inbound after. Including Part D and Medicare coverage expected by July 1. All encompassed with a possible buyout from sumitomo.

If you're looking for a good article that covers the basics, you can search the below. Theres also some great posts on reddit and stock twits. I am also happy to answer any questions.

*Why The Misunderstood Pfizer Deal Makes Myovant A Great Low-Risk Investment*

**Quick list of upcoming catalysts:**

THIS WEEK: EMA meets to possibly approve sale of orgovyx in Europe

By June 1: Deadline for FDA approval for a second use case (this could come early and will result in another 100m cash payment from Pfizer)

By July 1: Part d and Medicare coverage: also supposed to be obtained before July 1 for prostate cancer application

Pfizer optionality: Pfizer can opt in to have the rights to sell this in some markets, resulting in a 50m cash payment and royalties paid to myovant. Submission of relugolix for the treatment of endometriosis to the FDA

Catalysts that could happen at any time:  **BUYOUT** from Sumitomo ( aka Sumitovant) or other interested partner (See Urovant history. Sumi has a patent cliff in 2023 they are trying to patch with acquisitions, has purchased 4 of movants sister companies and already owns 53.5% of myovant).

Strategic acquisition of new drug candidates to further myovants pipeline.

**TLDR:**

EU and FDA approvals for drug candidates are expected within the next 2 weeks and could propel this to the moon.

2240,,2021-05-17 14:45:52,t3_nei5qk,,wallstreetbets,"As the cloud & big data continues to grow, as well as social media & 4k/8k video, data storage is becoming more important than ever.

Large social media sites take in a tremendous amount of data each day. This storage must not only be stored, but stored with redundancy as well as backups. Major sites such as Facebook and YouTube keep content that is over a decade old. Over time, the drives holding this content will fail and need to be replaced, leading to growing recurring demand as the size of the platform grows.

The need for storage has been growing for decades, but innovation in storage density and intense competition has limited profitability in the market in the past. That being said, there is reason to believe that the growth in storage density may stop keeping up with the growth in storage needs.

There is also reason to believe that transient growth in storage demand may drive higher Q2 earnings. A new digital currency, Chia, has gobbled up about 6 Exabytes worth of storage in the past 3 weeks, now growing at a rate of about 0.4 EiB per day(and rising). https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/netspace

For reference, about 288 Exabytes worth of hard drives were shipped in Q1 2021 https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hdd-shipments-in-q1-2021

Chia network size can be considered a lagging indicator for unexpected drive shipments. Generally, it can take a few weeks between when a drive is purchased and when it's actually accounted for on the network, as it takes time for it to be shipped, set up, and plotted. Chia wasn't even listed on exchanges until a couple weeks ago, so most of the growth seen is prior to Chia even having a price. At current prices, mining is incredibly profitable, with a $500 14 TB drive estimated to produce about $26 per day, and using very little power. So even if the network grows 10x to 60 Exabytes, it's still producing $3/day at current prices. So expect the surge in demand to continue.

I have seen many anecdotes of drive shortages over the past couple weeks. Reviewing sites like Amazon, I have also seen high capacity drives go out of stock or require lead times of a few weeks.

This may be a bit reminiscent of GPU shortages among Nvidia and AMD as miners seek to buy up anything they can.

If we project continued growth at 0.4 Exabytes a day in unexpected demand from proof of storage over the next 40 days, plus the 6 Exabytes added since April 20(leaving out first 3 weeks in quarter as they were likely logged last quarter), that's about 22 Exabytes to be added in Q2 that are not part of normal usage, or about an extra ~8% of Q1 demand.

What's perhaps most interesting is the impact this could have on margins. Unlike the GPUs used to mine which are consumer devices, the devices used for mining Chia includes enterprise grade hardware. Prices in the drive market are more flexible at the manufacturer level, and currently have much lower margins. If proof of storage currencies cause a drive shortage, it could have a significant impact on margins. Western digital sells about 40% of its drives through distributors, Seagate about 30%. Sales through these channels generally are very responsive to demand trends in terms of prices.

MDL 2989:  IN RE: January 2021 Short Squeeze Trading Litigation.

The first known instance of the word ""meme stocks"" in the legal lexicon. Consolidated on April Fool's day, 2021.

All active MDL dockets:

[Pending MDL Dockets by MDL Number](https://www.jpml.uscourts.gov/sites/jpml/files/Pending_MDL_Dockets_By_MDL_Number-May-17-2021.pdf);

IN RE: January 2021 Short Squeeze Trading Litigation transfer order:

What does this mean? It means that so many people filed lawsuits, including class actions, that they had to be consolidated into a single court as to avoid duplicitous litigation; very normal these days, but also indicative that this is a big deal legally speaking. Receiving an MDL assignment is considered very prestigious for a federal judge because it takes so much personal involvement and the cases often affect many, *many* people plus the state of the law more generally.

If you read those footnotes, you can see that some judges on the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (which is 7 very qualified federal judges) have recused themselves and others have had to renounce their claims (normal for judges) against the defendants to even participate, as they would have been members of the several putative actions. Meaning: one or more judges just on this small panel were holding meme stock at the time, if not currently.",nf7s3u,"Legal History: The First Use of the Word ""Meme Stocks"" in a Court Order; Some Judges Admit to Have Held Meme Stock in January"

Trading at x20 the market cap ***pre***pandemic on NO BULL NEWS.

There is no innovation, no merger, no acquisition, no new technology, no theatre construction, no theatre renovation, no plan to revive theatre interest in the USA (on a HUGE demographic decline over 10ys), no change in leadership, no replacing lost revenue streams from permanently closed theatres, no new subscription models...

Nothing.

They are changing... **nothing**.

Retail is holding some 80-90% of the shares, bullish? WRONG. There's a fundamental reason that institutions aren't *investing*, but short interest has been **increasing**.

The share price is OVER VALUE.

The company BARELY survived the pandemic, almost all of their competitors went bust. How did AMC survive? By being a valuable and irreplaceable service?

By diluting the fuck out of the stock. Thats why, despite ALL the buying pressure behind AMC... it didn't move above the 20s. Because the fucking company took your money and said ""thanks, idiots.""",,

UWMC is obviously picking up some steam here on Reddit with spillover into many other stock-related platforms (yahoo, twits, alpha, etc). That chatter will certainly help continue the push.

Up some change in Pre-market for what it's worth but should only get better throughout the day.  


This is a powder keg ready to go as soon as the 9c's go in the money. If we can exercise at 7.50 and 9 (EXERCISE FRIDAY 5/21 IF YOU CAN FRONT THE Cash!!!).   


I suggest exercising even if you are 0.01$ ITM.   


The Volume 05/17 was impressive at 17M (8M average) so there is certainly upwards pressure due to buying volume.   


Another 2 days like yesterday and those 9c start printing, then it is really off the races and not messing with 8,10% and instead watching a serious gap UP.  


Hopes some powder was saved for the push to 9c . I will be buying a few more shares today once some other options are sold for liquidity.   


Position:   
I am loaded up on 6/18 8c and LEAPS. I still really like UWMC long-term but this short-term profit potential is simply staggering.   


UWMC looks really good for breaking 9 by Thursday, we already have the 7.50c's ready to print from the push last week, then it's TO THE MOON as those options are exercised. 9c needs to hit this week to hit 12-14 (minimum) next week.

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season!

[**Anders Bylund**](https://boards.fool.com/profile/TMFZahrim/info.aspx) **(Nokia):** Few tech stocks have weathered the recent market storm quite like Finnish telecom infrastructure veteran Nokia. The stock has gained 32% since the New Year, including a 14% jump over the last 30 days. By contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is trading flat in 2021 and fell 7% in the last month.

This stock may feel like a joke due to the recent influx of Nokia interest from the Reddit-based WallStreetBets group, but that's just a coincidence. Nokia's real-world business prospects are solid and the stock is actually undervalued, even though it dodged the tech-stock market correction in recent months.

Nokia's solid market position was built on a foundation of [5G network](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) installations. Top-line sales are rising faster than expected, Nokia's profit margin is expanding as we speak thanks to the richer product mix, and the stock is changing hands for less than eight times free cash flow. You don't see that combination of deep-discount stock prices and robust business trends very often, and that makes Nokia a no-brainer buy right now.",ne3k42,Nokia an industry leader in the bargain bin

Home Depot reports earnings premarket 5/18. HD has beat earnings consistently and the share price has reacted negatively each time. In this market I feel like the play here is a strangle. My proposed play is the closest to the money strikes. Right now based on $324 list that would be the 5/21 323.5P/325C. You are in for about $1k. Break even is 3% in either direction. Of course we are hoping for 6% at least.

November earnings was a beat and the stock dropped 6% that day. That would be 100% profit with the trade I propose for educational purposes only. The previous report had a -3.2% drop that day which would still print.

Here is the kicker. The 5 day high is $344 (5/10) and low $317 (5/12) for a 2 day swing of 8.4% bases on Friday close. This is key because it means there is the potential for both sides of the strangle to be profitable prior to expiration! Nuts right?

Here is how to play it. Watch the housing report tomorrow (5/17). With lumber prices being insane new construction might be a miss. If HD stock goes down you will need to consider if the market will price this in when digesting an earnings miss. You will want to wait until the end of the day to enter the strangle to make sure you have strikes that put the Monday close in the middle.

If earnings are a beat and the prices goes up >3% sell the call once you are happy with the profit. Lock in your tuition money because again, this is for education. Same goes for the inverse. Then you have until Friday to try to get tendies with the other side. Can't remember the Vince Vaughn line from Dodge ball but it think it's ""that's what we call the jackpot"".

Not WSB material you say? Earnings plays are inherently gambling and sir, this is a casino.

Positions: none yet. Ask me at 3PM tomorrow you illiterate ape.

TLDR: Home Depot is usually located in  very close proximity to a Wendy's = tendies.

I‚Äôm a bull here for technical reasons. However, the fundamentals make sense here now as well.

The CDC letting ‚Äúvaccinated‚Äù people stop social distancing has majorly positive implications for the economy. Think of traveling, think of the impeding Memorial Day weekend...

Go check out the 1-year, 1-day charts for these stocks, and draw a line from the close on November 6th to now. I think we see 30% or more gains in the value of these stocks the next couple weeks.

I  have shared my thoughts on UWMC in past. The company announced Q1  earnings and while they look like they are below expectations it was  explained by the CEO that because of the speed of their execution, their  results are reflective of the higher rate environment already while  competitors are lagged.

During    the Q4 2020 earnings call he  had mused about options that would be on    the stable, special dividend,  buyback or raising the dividend.

**Feb Q4 Earnings Quote:**

The     Board did approve a dividend, a $0.10 quarterly dividend to be  paid    on  April 6 for all shareholders of record as of March 10. **We expect  this to be a regular quarterly dividend**.

And     so you guys know how we're thinking about this. Our balance sheet   is  a   fortress. And our current liquidity position is very strong, and    we   have access to the capital markets as well. The way we think  about   this   going forward is we're producing a lot of cash. We're  going to   maybe   be more profitable than some expected and be very  successful in   2021.   And **if we have excess cash that I and the Board deem is too much,  we will be delivering that back**. And whether we have to **change     the  dividend in the future, as in raise it or a special dividend,     those  things are definitely on the table or even buying back shares**.

**May Q1 Earnings Quote:**

As     you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of      $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a      record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I always  **explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special  dividend or a share buyback program**. As you guys have seen, we **concluded      share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward   shareholders.    We announced the authorization of $300 million share   buyback over the    next 24 months**.  And **quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that**.

**Then in answering a question from an analyst**

Doug    Harter -  Great. And then just in terms of capital return, you    mentioned sort of  the float. I  guess just how are you thinking about    kind of **how much of  the float  you'd be willing to take out and pacing around share  repurchase**?

Mat Ishbia -  Yes, Doug. So I'm learning these rules as we go **because at this stock  price, I'm a buyer, right**?    And so we'll buy shares as soon as tomorrow, I  think, as our legal    teams say we're allowed to do. And so I don't know  how many I can buy    and what I can do, but I'm very conscientious of the  float.  If the    float was not a concern, **we'd be more aggressive**. However,  **we     have authorization from the Board to buy up to $300 million, and I'm      going to take advantage of that opportunity while being  conscientious     of our partners in the float.**

TL/DR:     UWMC and their board have been looking at ways to give back to     shareholders. Instead of a short term cash out, they decided on a     buyback that they are planning to exercise immediately on so that they     can retire shares while the SP is low. They will NOT buy so much that   it   will ruin their float % for Russell. The CEO is aggressive, has    approval to spend $300 and he's going to take FULL advantage.  The CEO has stated he is a BUYER! They are  not   waiting, it's being deployed now.

If we can open above 6.9 (50day SMA) I think we can close around that 7.14 (200day SMA) level which should line us up for that move out of the $6-$8 range and into the $10s and beyond.

Now funny enough what actually has me the most bullish this morning is looking at Friday alone. Selling pressure was suppressed by the bulls and it closed right near HOD above all major resistances.

UWMC is ready to pop!

I was in UWMC for the value play. It is a STEAL at 10$ on fundamentals anything below that is an insane deal. Even above 10 has a strong long-term argument.

Here is UWMC in a nutshell: heavily shorted, borrow costs skyrocketing, mortgage industry hit overly hard on fears of rising interest rates, the CEO Ishiba announces a 300M stock buyback, and shorts are QUAKING. UP 6% in premarket following being up 1-2% Friday. This puts at starting at $8 Monday with $9 being a CRITICAL Friday target for us.

All UWMC needs is a little unexpected retail buying pressure and it POPS! In truth this is not just a short squeeze, its multiple plays rolled into one. We have retail buying hype train going (obviously, look at all the WSB posts here posted below), short-squeeze due to high cost of borrow, Gamma squeeze due to the MASSIVE options interest, 300M stock buyback by CEO to scare off the shorts, an unfair post-earnings plunge, plus good-ole\` company doing good things (making money).

We coming back for some of our loyal bagholders that have been holding UWMC since the last train to $14, hey guys remember to take profit this time ;)

It is now cost-prohibitive to use more shorts to keep the price low. The normal dirty tricks triple in price so become less-used. Shorts use this borrow price to determine feasibility and 93% is obviously unfeasible, THEY WILL COVER. Once one group starts covering and causes a spike, other shorts will rush to do the same.

It's a prisoner's dilemma and HF's want to cut each other's throats just as much as ours. Let's let them!!!

Many of these 7.50,9. 10, and 12 are OTM or barely ITM. and an early week spike to put 9c ITM would force MM's to hedge to delta-neutral...further pushing 10c and 12.50 c into hedge territory. This can quickly cause things to spiral out of control for shorts.

Stock BuyBack,

Ishbia is going to war with the shorts and his weapon of choice is a 300M stock buyback (similar to RKT's special dividend for the same purpose). The buyback could have started happening as early as May 11th.

Most of the float is owned by institutions and insiders so this buyback puts increased pressure of a heavily shorted (13%+) and heavily held float pool.

Retail is gorging on the float, institutions are holding the float, and Ishbia is buying the free float up. This is a recipe for ROCKET FUEL. WIth shorts paying 93%, they will stop shorting so the shares we are buying are REAL, not synthetic.

Make them buy real shares, from us, at 20$ each.

I am in UWMC for the long-term VALUE-PLAY and like the stock. I like the company., I like the CEO. I like the market position. I like the value. I ilke the stock.

I am loading up on 6/18 8c options. Options are important as we move up to force MM's to buy to remain market neutral.

Options do not pay unless we buy shares, so I suggest splitting half/half to each. options can cause MM's to balance risk and lead to large upswings but this cannot happen without buying pressure and the underlying spiking to necessitate balancing risk, which means we need to buy stocks as well.

Options are good for Gamma Squeeze/MM's balance buys (and profit) but shares are needed to keep the underlying JOOSED and keep those options deep ITM.

MIX IT UP!

This is the final call for the UWMC tendie train so get your fucking tickets and remember; Gravy costs extra,

2448,,2021-05-17 13:20:55,t3_neg3ey,,wallstreetbets,"$UWMC has become one of the most hyped stocks in the online investment community. Online activity appears to be ramping up after earnings and heading into May 21st option expiries. Since UWM is getting a lot of new eyes, it seemed like an appropriate time to share why some investors may consider UWM as a long term hold. 

UWM is a mortgage company that focuses exclusively on the broker channel. It‚Äôs the largest wholesale mortgage provider in the US and the second largest mortgage originator, behind Rocket Companies. 

It‚Äôs CEO is Mat Ishbia, who started as it‚Äôs 12th employee and who‚Äôs dad, Jeff, started the company as a side hustle. Mat and his brother own 94% of the company in Class D shares. The rest of the public float, \~100m Class A shares, are what is available for the public to purchase. 

# What trends are pushing $UWMC‚Äôs stock down? 

**The largest threat UWM is facing is raising interest rates**: 

About 75% of UWM income is related to refinance activity. The pandemic pushed rates to historic lows so most consumers were better off refinancing. Millions have done that, leading to record profit for mortgage providers like UWM and Rocket. 

**The strength of the broker channel:**

UWM is completely dependent on brokers finding business and closing loans. It doesn‚Äôt have any direct-to-consumer lending operations like Rocket does. 

**Short Interest:** 

Sophisticated investors are seeing 75% of income potentially attached to rate sensitive products (not all refi‚Äôs are rate sensitive like cash out), and are salivating. They think the market is under appreciating this headwind and shorting the stock. They have basically shorted all the shares they can. Friday the stock ended with 200 shares available and an insane 93% borrow rate. 

**SPAC:**

It is true that the SPAC market has softened recently. It is very reasonable to assume $UWMC is a part of that softening. It may not attract institutional investors because of the SPAC situation and the short period it has been publicly traded. Lots of other nice places to put institutional money.

**Competitors:** Mortgages are a mature market and competition is fierce. Rocket, LoanDepot and UWM mentioned a pricing war in their earnings. (LD statement). This will compress loan sale margins in the short term. 

**What trends are pushing $UWMC stock up?** 

**Short term retail pressure:**

there is a lot of retail attention on the potential short squeeze/gamma squeeze you could see this week in UWMC. My post is about UWM‚Äôs long term perspective, so I‚Äôll let [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ndcm0p/uwmc_is_a_powderkeg_low_float_high_short_huge/) take you further down that rabbit hole. Additionally, smart money is now tracking online sentiment, which can lead to increased institutional purchases. 

**Broker Channel Growth:** Mat has claimed two reasons for taking UWM public. He wanted access to the liquidity market and marketing exposure for the broker channel. For UWM to become the largest mortgage originator, Mat has targeted ‚Öì mortgages to be originated by brokers and UWM to own 50% of that channel by 2025/26. Currently UWM owns 36% of the broker channel with brokers originating 20% of all mortgages. Before the housing crisis in 2008, brokers were 58% of mortgage originations (Per Mat & Q1 2021 Earnings call), so it isn‚Äôt crazy to think they could get back to ‚Öì as it is growing: [https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum](https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum)

I had a loan with Rocket and tried to refinance with them. I then went through a mortgage broker and got the same loan for $4.5k cheaper in closing costs. This is because Rocket‚Äôs retail channel has 4% margins and it‚Äôs partnership network (includes wholesale, realtors, etc.) has 1% margins. 

**New Product Offerings:** 

UWM recently released new products like their jumbo loan. In earnings, Mat said he expects $2b in volume from Jumbo. They also added ARM‚Äôs, manufactured homes and expanded government programs. 

**Wholesale mortgage provider consolidation:** 

Mat said 3 of the top 25 wholesale lenders have been purchased in the last 90 days. This type of consolidation happens in mature markets by companies that are reaching for market share. THis could be a sign companies are under pressure to grow but cannot organically get market share from UWM. 

**UWM ‚ÄúAll In‚Äù Ultimatum:** 

Rocket and Fairway are priortizing other channels (cause the margins are so much higher) and trying to squeeze out brokers. UWM said if you work with those two, don‚Äôt work for us. The goal was to stand up for the broker channel WHILE putting some pressure on Rocket and Fairway‚Äôs partnership channel. This may have kickstarted the pricing war. 

**Aggressive Capital returns:** 

UWM pays an annual .40 dividend on its class A shares. That only costs them \~$42m/year. Remember their Q1 net income was $800m+. So their dividends hardly affect the balance sheet. The board just approved a $300/million share buyback as well that will reduce share count. Mat knows a thing or two about shorting stocks. He just sold at $10 and has authority to buy back with the current price under $8. The man successfully shorted his own company. What a legend. 

**Long Term Prediction:** 

I‚Äôm invested in UWM because I believe the capital returns will be aggressive during the upswing and the company will remain profitable in a downturn. With a 5%+ dividend return, share buyback, and \*potentially\* growing market share, UWM could be primed to overtake Rocket within the next few years.

2452,,2021-05-17 14:45:52,t3_nei5qk,,wallstreetbets,"As the cloud & big data continues to grow, as well as social media & 4k/8k video, data storage is becoming more important than ever.

Large social media sites take in a tremendous amount of data each day. This storage must not only be stored, but stored with redundancy as well as backups. Major sites such as Facebook and YouTube keep content that is over a decade old. Over time, the drives holding this content will fail and need to be replaced, leading to growing recurring demand as the size of the platform grows.

The need for storage has been growing for decades, but innovation in storage density and intense competition has limited profitability in the market in the past. That being said, there is reason to believe that the growth in storage density may stop keeping up with the growth in storage needs.

There is also reason to believe that transient growth in storage demand may drive higher Q2 earnings. A new digital currency, Chia, has gobbled up about 6 Exabytes worth of storage in the past 3 weeks, now growing at a rate of about 0.4 EiB per day(and rising). https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/netspace

For reference, about 288 Exabytes worth of hard drives were shipped in Q1 2021 https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hdd-shipments-in-q1-2021

Chia network size can be considered a lagging indicator for unexpected drive shipments. Generally, it can take a few weeks between when a drive is purchased and when it's actually accounted for on the network, as it takes time for it to be shipped, set up, and plotted. Chia wasn't even listed on exchanges until a couple weeks ago, so most of the growth seen is prior to Chia even having a price. At current prices, mining is incredibly profitable, with a $500 14 TB drive estimated to produce about $26 per day, and using very little power. So even if the network grows 10x to 60 Exabytes, it's still producing $3/day at current prices. So expect the surge in demand to continue.

I have seen many anecdotes of drive shortages over the past couple weeks. Reviewing sites like Amazon, I have also seen high capacity drives go out of stock or require lead times of a few weeks.

This may be a bit reminiscent of GPU shortages among Nvidia and AMD as miners seek to buy up anything they can.

If we project continued growth at 0.4 Exabytes a day in unexpected demand from proof of storage over the next 40 days, plus the 6 Exabytes added since April 20(leaving out first 3 weeks in quarter as they were likely logged last quarter), that's about 22 Exabytes to be added in Q2 that are not part of normal usage, or about an extra ~8% of Q1 demand.

What's perhaps most interesting is the impact this could have on margins. Unlike the GPUs used to mine which are consumer devices, the devices used for mining Chia includes enterprise grade hardware. Prices in the drive market are more flexible at the manufacturer level, and currently have much lower margins. If proof of storage currencies cause a drive shortage, it could have a significant impact on margins. Western digital sells about 40% of its drives through distributors, Seagate about 30%. Sales through these channels generally are very responsive to demand trends in terms of prices.

Seagate is also in a position to profit from this, but I'm a bit more worried about them as hard drive shipments have been on a long term decline and they aren't diversified into SSDs/flash like Western Digital is.

2590,gyk0xja,2021-05-18 11:19:37,t1_gyk0xja,t3_nf6oeg,wallstreetbets,"LONDON (Reuters) - Investors are estimated to have lost $930 million on their short positions in meme stocks GameStop(GME) and AMC Entertainment(AMC) over the last five trading days, data from financial analytics firm Ortex showed on Tuesday.  
  
Shares in GameStop(GME), which was at the heart of the so-called ""stonks"" retail trading mania earlier this year, have risen by a third in the last one week, while shares in cinema operator AMC are up 39%.  
  
Ortex said short interest in AMC is currently estimated to be 18.3% of freefloat and in GME it is estimated at 21.8% of freefloat.  
  
Yesterday alone, short-sellers lost over $200 million each in both of those stocks, Ortex data shows. GameStop(GME) closed 13% higher at $180.6, the highest level since April 30.

However, that may be due to lack of short volume as the price has went up.

At this post by we can only guess if the price went down because shorts are no longer shorting or that a short exited thier positions (making the short shares available would power the price).

HF's pay attention now and may not want to short in the face of retail hype on the stock.

No one really knows.

I'm holding. I was in this long before the squeeze and looking at volume yesterday, the options volume at 7.50 and 9c.

I would say the dropping borrow costs is not favorable but the other forces seem to be going stronger than when I posted originally (momentum, volume, options printing and steady rise) so I wouldn't see that as a bearish sign due to the dentist there indicators.",,

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

My suggestion is wait until Tesla pumps so the IV on the options can build up then sell the calls. I would sell weeklies and far enough out of the money so you don't lose your shares.

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season!

[**Anders Bylund**](https://boards.fool.com/profile/TMFZahrim/info.aspx) **(Nokia):** Few tech stocks have weathered the recent market storm quite like Finnish telecom infrastructure veteran Nokia. The stock has gained 32% since the New Year, including a 14% jump over the last 30 days. By contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is trading flat in 2021 and fell 7% in the last month.

This stock may feel like a joke due to the recent influx of Nokia interest from the Reddit-based WallStreetBets group, but that's just a coincidence. Nokia's real-world business prospects are solid and the stock is actually undervalued, even though it dodged the tech-stock market correction in recent months.

Nokia's solid market position was built on a foundation of [5G network](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) installations. Top-line sales are rising faster than expected, Nokia's profit margin is expanding as we speak thanks to the richer product mix, and the stock is changing hands for less than eight times free cash flow. You don't see that combination of deep-discount stock prices and robust business trends very often, and that makes Nokia a no-brainer buy right now.",ne3k42,Nokia an industry leader in the bargain bin

Home Depot reports earnings premarket 5/18. HD has beat earnings consistently and the share price has reacted negatively each time. In this market I feel like the play here is a strangle. My proposed play is the closest to the money strikes. Right now based on $324 list that would be the 5/21 323.5P/325C. You are in for about $1k. Break even is 3% in either direction. Of course we are hoping for 6% at least.

November earnings was a beat and the stock dropped 6% that day. That would be 100% profit with the trade I propose for educational purposes only. The previous report had a -3.2% drop that day which would still print.

Here is the kicker. The 5 day high is $344 (5/10) and low $317 (5/12) for a 2 day swing of 8.4% bases on Friday close. This is key because it means there is the potential for both sides of the strangle to be profitable prior to expiration! Nuts right?

Here is how to play it. Watch the housing report tomorrow (5/17). With lumber prices being insane new construction might be a miss. If HD stock goes down you will need to consider if the market will price this in when digesting an earnings miss. You will want to wait until the end of the day to enter the strangle to make sure you have strikes that put the Monday close in the middle.

If earnings are a beat and the prices goes up >3% sell the call once you are happy with the profit. Lock in your tuition money because again, this is for education. Same goes for the inverse. Then you have until Friday to try to get tendies with the other side. Can't remember the Vince Vaughn line from Dodge ball but it think it's ""that's what we call the jackpot"".

Not WSB material you say? Earnings plays are inherently gambling and sir, this is a casino.

Positions: none yet. Ask me at 3PM tomorrow you illiterate ape.

TLDR: Home Depot is usually located in  very close proximity to a Wendy's = tendies.

I‚Äôm a bull here for technical reasons. However, the fundamentals make sense here now as well.

The CDC letting ‚Äúvaccinated‚Äù people stop social distancing has majorly positive implications for the economy. Think of traveling, think of the impeding Memorial Day weekend...

Go check out the 1-year, 1-day charts for these stocks, and draw a line from the close on November 6th to now. I think we see 30% or more gains in the value of these stocks the next couple weeks.

I  have shared my thoughts on UWMC in past. The company announced Q1  earnings and while they look like they are below expectations it was  explained by the CEO that because of the speed of their execution, their  results are reflective of the higher rate environment already while  competitors are lagged.

During    the Q4 2020 earnings call he  had mused about options that would be on    the stable, special dividend,  buyback or raising the dividend.

**Feb Q4 Earnings Quote:**

The     Board did approve a dividend, a $0.10 quarterly dividend to be  paid    on  April 6 for all shareholders of record as of March 10. **We expect  this to be a regular quarterly dividend**.

And     so you guys know how we're thinking about this. Our balance sheet   is  a   fortress. And our current liquidity position is very strong, and    we   have access to the capital markets as well. The way we think  about   this   going forward is we're producing a lot of cash. We're  going to   maybe   be more profitable than some expected and be very  successful in   2021.   And **if we have excess cash that I and the Board deem is too much,  we will be delivering that back**. And whether we have to **change     the  dividend in the future, as in raise it or a special dividend,     those  things are definitely on the table or even buying back shares**.

**May Q1 Earnings Quote:**

As     you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of      $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a      record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I always  **explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special  dividend or a share buyback program**. As you guys have seen, we **concluded      share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward   shareholders.    We announced the authorization of $300 million share   buyback over the    next 24 months**.  And **quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that**.

**Then in answering a question from an analyst**

Doug    Harter -  Great. And then just in terms of capital return, you    mentioned sort of  the float. I  guess just how are you thinking about    kind of **how much of  the float  you'd be willing to take out and pacing around share  repurchase**?

Mat Ishbia -  Yes, Doug. So I'm learning these rules as we go **because at this stock  price, I'm a buyer, right**?    And so we'll buy shares as soon as tomorrow, I  think, as our legal    teams say we're allowed to do. And so I don't know  how many I can buy    and what I can do, but I'm very conscientious of the  float.  If the    float was not a concern, **we'd be more aggressive**. However,  **we     have authorization from the Board to buy up to $300 million, and I'm      going to take advantage of that opportunity while being  conscientious     of our partners in the float.**

TL/DR:     UWMC and their board have been looking at ways to give back to     shareholders. Instead of a short term cash out, they decided on a     buyback that they are planning to exercise immediately on so that they     can retire shares while the SP is low. They will NOT buy so much that   it   will ruin their float % for Russell. The CEO is aggressive, has    approval to spend $300 and he's going to take FULL advantage.  The CEO has stated he is a BUYER! They are  not   waiting, it's being deployed now.

If we can open above 6.9 (50day SMA) I think we can close around that 7.14 (200day SMA) level which should line us up for that move out of the $6-$8 range and into the $10s and beyond.

Now funny enough what actually has me the most bullish this morning is looking at Friday alone. Selling pressure was suppressed by the bulls and it closed right near HOD above all major resistances.

UWMC is ready to pop!

I was in UWMC for the value play. It is a STEAL at 10$ on fundamentals anything below that is an insane deal. Even above 10 has a strong long-term argument.

Here is UWMC in a nutshell: heavily shorted, borrow costs skyrocketing, mortgage industry hit overly hard on fears of rising interest rates, the CEO Ishiba announces a 300M stock buyback, and shorts are QUAKING. UP 6% in premarket following being up 1-2% Friday. This puts at starting at $8 Monday with $9 being a CRITICAL Friday target for us.

All UWMC needs is a little unexpected retail buying pressure and it POPS! In truth this is not just a short squeeze, its multiple plays rolled into one. We have retail buying hype train going (obviously, look at all the WSB posts here posted below), short-squeeze due to high cost of borrow, Gamma squeeze due to the MASSIVE options interest, 300M stock buyback by CEO to scare off the shorts, an unfair post-earnings plunge, plus good-ole\` company doing good things (making money).

We coming back for some of our loyal bagholders that have been holding UWMC since the last train to $14, hey guys remember to take profit this time ;)

It is now cost-prohibitive to use more shorts to keep the price low. The normal dirty tricks triple in price so become less-used. Shorts use this borrow price to determine feasibility and 93% is obviously unfeasible, THEY WILL COVER. Once one group starts covering and causes a spike, other shorts will rush to do the same.

It's a prisoner's dilemma and HF's want to cut each other's throats just as much as ours. Let's let them!!!

Many of these 7.50,9. 10, and 12 are OTM or barely ITM. and an early week spike to put 9c ITM would force MM's to hedge to delta-neutral...further pushing 10c and 12.50 c into hedge territory. This can quickly cause things to spiral out of control for shorts.

Stock BuyBack,

Ishbia is going to war with the shorts and his weapon of choice is a 300M stock buyback (similar to RKT's special dividend for the same purpose). The buyback could have started happening as early as May 11th.

Most of the float is owned by institutions and insiders so this buyback puts increased pressure of a heavily shorted (13%+) and heavily held float pool.

Retail is gorging on the float, institutions are holding the float, and Ishbia is buying the free float up. This is a recipe for ROCKET FUEL. WIth shorts paying 93%, they will stop shorting so the shares we are buying are REAL, not synthetic.

Make them buy real shares, from us, at 20$ each.

I am in UWMC for the long-term VALUE-PLAY and like the stock. I like the company., I like the CEO. I like the market position. I like the value. I ilke the stock.

I am loading up on 6/18 8c options. Options are important as we move up to force MM's to buy to remain market neutral.

Options do not pay unless we buy shares, so I suggest splitting half/half to each. options can cause MM's to balance risk and lead to large upswings but this cannot happen without buying pressure and the underlying spiking to necessitate balancing risk, which means we need to buy stocks as well.

Options are good for Gamma Squeeze/MM's balance buys (and profit) but shares are needed to keep the underlying JOOSED and keep those options deep ITM.

MIX IT UP!

This is the final call for the UWMC tendie train so get your fucking tickets and remember; Gravy costs extra,

3123,,2021-05-17 13:20:55,t3_neg3ey,,wallstreetbets,"$UWMC has become one of the most hyped stocks in the online investment community. Online activity appears to be ramping up after earnings and heading into May 21st option expiries. Since UWM is getting a lot of new eyes, it seemed like an appropriate time to share why some investors may consider UWM as a long term hold. 

UWM is a mortgage company that focuses exclusively on the broker channel. It‚Äôs the largest wholesale mortgage provider in the US and the second largest mortgage originator, behind Rocket Companies. 

It‚Äôs CEO is Mat Ishbia, who started as it‚Äôs 12th employee and who‚Äôs dad, Jeff, started the company as a side hustle. Mat and his brother own 94% of the company in Class D shares. The rest of the public float, \~100m Class A shares, are what is available for the public to purchase. 

# What trends are pushing $UWMC‚Äôs stock down? 

**The largest threat UWM is facing is raising interest rates**: 

About 75% of UWM income is related to refinance activity. The pandemic pushed rates to historic lows so most consumers were better off refinancing. Millions have done that, leading to record profit for mortgage providers like UWM and Rocket. 

**The strength of the broker channel:**

UWM is completely dependent on brokers finding business and closing loans. It doesn‚Äôt have any direct-to-consumer lending operations like Rocket does. 

**Short Interest:** 

Sophisticated investors are seeing 75% of income potentially attached to rate sensitive products (not all refi‚Äôs are rate sensitive like cash out), and are salivating. They think the market is under appreciating this headwind and shorting the stock. They have basically shorted all the shares they can. Friday the stock ended with 200 shares available and an insane 93% borrow rate. 

**SPAC:**

It is true that the SPAC market has softened recently. It is very reasonable to assume $UWMC is a part of that softening. It may not attract institutional investors because of the SPAC situation and the short period it has been publicly traded. Lots of other nice places to put institutional money.

**Competitors:** Mortgages are a mature market and competition is fierce. Rocket, LoanDepot and UWM mentioned a pricing war in their earnings. (LD statement). This will compress loan sale margins in the short term. 

**What trends are pushing $UWMC stock up?** 

**Short term retail pressure:**

there is a lot of retail attention on the potential short squeeze/gamma squeeze you could see this week in UWMC. My post is about UWM‚Äôs long term perspective, so I‚Äôll let [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ndcm0p/uwmc_is_a_powderkeg_low_float_high_short_huge/) take you further down that rabbit hole. Additionally, smart money is now tracking online sentiment, which can lead to increased institutional purchases. 

**Broker Channel Growth:** Mat has claimed two reasons for taking UWM public. He wanted access to the liquidity market and marketing exposure for the broker channel. For UWM to become the largest mortgage originator, Mat has targeted ‚Öì mortgages to be originated by brokers and UWM to own 50% of that channel by 2025/26. Currently UWM owns 36% of the broker channel with brokers originating 20% of all mortgages. Before the housing crisis in 2008, brokers were 58% of mortgage originations (Per Mat & Q1 2021 Earnings call), so it isn‚Äôt crazy to think they could get back to ‚Öì as it is growing: [https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum](https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum)

I had a loan with Rocket and tried to refinance with them. I then went through a mortgage broker and got the same loan for $4.5k cheaper in closing costs. This is because Rocket‚Äôs retail channel has 4% margins and it‚Äôs partnership network (includes wholesale, realtors, etc.) has 1% margins. 

**New Product Offerings:** 

UWM recently released new products like their jumbo loan. In earnings, Mat said he expects $2b in volume from Jumbo. They also added ARM‚Äôs, manufactured homes and expanded government programs. 

**Wholesale mortgage provider consolidation:** 

Mat said 3 of the top 25 wholesale lenders have been purchased in the last 90 days. This type of consolidation happens in mature markets by companies that are reaching for market share. THis could be a sign companies are under pressure to grow but cannot organically get market share from UWM. 

**UWM ‚ÄúAll In‚Äù Ultimatum:** 

Rocket and Fairway are priortizing other channels (cause the margins are so much higher) and trying to squeeze out brokers. UWM said if you work with those two, don‚Äôt work for us. The goal was to stand up for the broker channel WHILE putting some pressure on Rocket and Fairway‚Äôs partnership channel. This may have kickstarted the pricing war. 

**Aggressive Capital returns:** 

UWM pays an annual .40 dividend on its class A shares. That only costs them \~$42m/year. Remember their Q1 net income was $800m+. So their dividends hardly affect the balance sheet. The board just approved a $300/million share buyback as well that will reduce share count. Mat knows a thing or two about shorting stocks. He just sold at $10 and has authority to buy back with the current price under $8. The man successfully shorted his own company. What a legend. 

**Long Term Prediction:** 

I‚Äôm invested in UWM because I believe the capital returns will be aggressive during the upswing and the company will remain profitable in a downturn. With a 5%+ dividend return, share buyback, and \*potentially\* growing market share, UWM could be primed to overtake Rocket within the next few years.

3127,,2021-05-17 14:45:52,t3_nei5qk,,wallstreetbets,"As the cloud & big data continues to grow, as well as social media & 4k/8k video, data storage is becoming more important than ever.

Large social media sites take in a tremendous amount of data each day. This storage must not only be stored, but stored with redundancy as well as backups. Major sites such as Facebook and YouTube keep content that is over a decade old. Over time, the drives holding this content will fail and need to be replaced, leading to growing recurring demand as the size of the platform grows.

The need for storage has been growing for decades, but innovation in storage density and intense competition has limited profitability in the market in the past. That being said, there is reason to believe that the growth in storage density may stop keeping up with the growth in storage needs.

There is also reason to believe that transient growth in storage demand may drive higher Q2 earnings. A new digital currency, Chia, has gobbled up about 6 Exabytes worth of storage in the past 3 weeks, now growing at a rate of about 0.4 EiB per day(and rising). https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/netspace

For reference, about 288 Exabytes worth of hard drives were shipped in Q1 2021 https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hdd-shipments-in-q1-2021

Chia network size can be considered a lagging indicator for unexpected drive shipments. Generally, it can take a few weeks between when a drive is purchased and when it's actually accounted for on the network, as it takes time for it to be shipped, set up, and plotted. Chia wasn't even listed on exchanges until a couple weeks ago, so most of the growth seen is prior to Chia even having a price. At current prices, mining is incredibly profitable, with a $500 14 TB drive estimated to produce about $26 per day, and using very little power. So even if the network grows 10x to 60 Exabytes, it's still producing $3/day at current prices. So expect the surge in demand to continue.

I have seen many anecdotes of drive shortages over the past couple weeks. Reviewing sites like Amazon, I have also seen high capacity drives go out of stock or require lead times of a few weeks.

This may be a bit reminiscent of GPU shortages among Nvidia and AMD as miners seek to buy up anything they can.

If we project continued growth at 0.4 Exabytes a day in unexpected demand from proof of storage over the next 40 days, plus the 6 Exabytes added since April 20(leaving out first 3 weeks in quarter as they were likely logged last quarter), that's about 22 Exabytes to be added in Q2 that are not part of normal usage, or about an extra ~8% of Q1 demand.

What's perhaps most interesting is the impact this could have on margins. Unlike the GPUs used to mine which are consumer devices, the devices used for mining Chia includes enterprise grade hardware. Prices in the drive market are more flexible at the manufacturer level, and currently have much lower margins. If proof of storage currencies cause a drive shortage, it could have a significant impact on margins. Western digital sells about 40% of its drives through distributors, Seagate about 30%. Sales through these channels generally are very responsive to demand trends in terms of prices.

Seagate is also in a position to profit from this, but I'm a bit more worried about them as hard drive shipments have been on a long term decline and they aren't diversified into SSDs/flash like Western Digital is.

[**Anders Bylund**](https://boards.fool.com/profile/TMFZahrim/info.aspx) **(Nokia):** Few tech stocks have weathered the recent market storm quite like Finnish telecom infrastructure veteran Nokia. The stock has gained 32% since the New Year, including a 14% jump over the last 30 days. By contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is trading flat in 2021 and fell 7% in the last month.

This stock may feel like a joke due to the recent influx of Nokia interest from the Reddit-based WallStreetBets group, but that's just a coincidence. Nokia's real-world business prospects are solid and the stock is actually undervalued, even though it dodged the tech-stock market correction in recent months.

Nokia's solid market position was built on a foundation of [5G network](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) installations. Top-line sales are rising faster than expected, Nokia's profit margin is expanding as we speak thanks to the richer product mix, and the stock is changing hands for less than eight times free cash flow. You don't see that combination of deep-discount stock prices and robust business trends very often, and that makes Nokia a no-brainer buy right now.",ne3k42,Nokia an industry leader in the bargain bin

Home Depot reports earnings premarket 5/18. HD has beat earnings consistently and the share price has reacted negatively each time. In this market I feel like the play here is a strangle. My proposed play is the closest to the money strikes. Right now based on $324 list that would be the 5/21 323.5P/325C. You are in for about $1k. Break even is 3% in either direction. Of course we are hoping for 6% at least.

November earnings was a beat and the stock dropped 6% that day. That would be 100% profit with the trade I propose for educational purposes only. The previous report had a -3.2% drop that day which would still print.

Here is the kicker. The 5 day high is $344 (5/10) and low $317 (5/12) for a 2 day swing of 8.4% bases on Friday close. This is key because it means there is the potential for both sides of the strangle to be profitable prior to expiration! Nuts right?

Here is how to play it. Watch the housing report tomorrow (5/17). With lumber prices being insane new construction might be a miss. If HD stock goes down you will need to consider if the market will price this in when digesting an earnings miss. You will want to wait until the end of the day to enter the strangle to make sure you have strikes that put the Monday close in the middle.

If earnings are a beat and the prices goes up >3% sell the call once you are happy with the profit. Lock in your tuition money because again, this is for education. Same goes for the inverse. Then you have until Friday to try to get tendies with the other side. Can't remember the Vince Vaughn line from Dodge ball but it think it's ""that's what we call the jackpot"".

Not WSB material you say? Earnings plays are inherently gambling and sir, this is a casino.

Positions: none yet. Ask me at 3PM tomorrow you illiterate ape.

TLDR: Home Depot is usually located in  very close proximity to a Wendy's = tendies.

Friday, I decided to load up on 1-2 week out OTM calls (at strikes probably around 10%-30% above the current market value). I‚Äôll be throwing a couple grand a week at this trade til it hits!

I‚Äôm a bull here for technical reasons. However, the fundamentals make sense here now as well. The current bull-market trendlines on all the reopen stonks started with a vaccine announcement on November 9th in the early A.M.

The CDC letting ‚Äúvaccinated‚Äù people stop social distancing has majorly positive implications for the economy. Think of traveling, think of the impeding Memorial Day weekend...

Go check out the 1-year, 1-day charts for these stocks, and draw a line from the close on November 6th to now. I think we see 30% or more gains in the value of these stocks the next couple weeks.

I  have shared my thoughts on UWMC in past. The company announced Q1  earnings and while they look like they are below expectations it was  explained by the CEO that because of the speed of their execution, their  results are reflective of the higher rate environment already while  competitors are lagged.

During    the Q4 2020 earnings call he  had mused about options that would be on    the stable, special dividend,  buyback or raising the dividend.

**Feb Q4 Earnings Quote:**

The     Board did approve a dividend, a $0.10 quarterly dividend to be  paid    on  April 6 for all shareholders of record as of March 10. **We expect  this to be a regular quarterly dividend**.

And     so you guys know how we're thinking about this. Our balance sheet   is  a   fortress. And our current liquidity position is very strong, and    we   have access to the capital markets as well. The way we think  about   this   going forward is we're producing a lot of cash. We're  going to   maybe   be more profitable than some expected and be very  successful in   2021.   And **if we have excess cash that I and the Board deem is too much,  we will be delivering that back**. And whether we have to **change     the  dividend in the future, as in raise it or a special dividend,     those  things are definitely on the table or even buying back shares**.

**May Q1 Earnings Quote:**

As     you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of      $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a      record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I always  **explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special  dividend or a share buyback program**. As you guys have seen, we **concluded      share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward   shareholders.    We announced the authorization of $300 million share   buyback over the    next 24 months**.  And **quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that**.

**Then in answering a question from an analyst**

Doug    Harter -  Great. And then just in terms of capital return, you    mentioned sort of  the float. I  guess just how are you thinking about    kind of **how much of  the float  you'd be willing to take out and pacing around share  repurchase**?

Mat Ishbia -  Yes, Doug. So I'm learning these rules as we go **because at this stock  price, I'm a buyer, right**?    And so we'll buy shares as soon as tomorrow, I  think, as our legal    teams say we're allowed to do. And so I don't know  how many I can buy    and what I can do, but I'm very conscientious of the  float.  If the    float was not a concern, **we'd be more aggressive**. However,  **we     have authorization from the Board to buy up to $300 million, and I'm      going to take advantage of that opportunity while being  conscientious     of our partners in the float.**

TL/DR:     UWMC and their board have been looking at ways to give back to     shareholders. Instead of a short term cash out, they decided on a     buyback that they are planning to exercise immediately on so that they     can retire shares while the SP is low. They will NOT buy so much that   it   will ruin their float % for Russell. The CEO is aggressive, has    approval to spend $300 and he's going to take FULL advantage.  The CEO has stated he is a BUYER! They are  not   waiting, it's being deployed now.

Step 1 for me is zooming out. Despite the current market WELL actually held up quite strong - Beautiful Weekly close wicked just above the 20day SMA forming a nice support (Double bottom) in this 6.20 -8.20 channel. If we can snap this losing streak I think that might be our immediate next stop.

If we can open above 6.9 (50day SMA) I think we can close around that 7.14 (200day SMA) level which should line us up for that move out of the $6-$8 range and into the $10s and beyond.

Now funny enough what actually has me the most bullish this morning is looking at Friday alone. Selling pressure was suppressed by the bulls and it closed right near HOD above all major resistances.

UWMC is ready to pop!

I was in UWMC for the value play. It is a STEAL at 10$ on fundamentals anything below that is an insane deal. Even above 10 has a strong long-term argument.

Here is UWMC in a nutshell: heavily shorted, borrow costs skyrocketing, mortgage industry hit overly hard on fears of rising interest rates, the CEO Ishiba announces a 300M stock buyback, and shorts are QUAKING. UP 6% in premarket following being up 1-2% Friday. This puts at starting at $8 Monday with $9 being a CRITICAL Friday target for us.

All UWMC needs is a little unexpected retail buying pressure and it POPS! In truth this is not just a short squeeze, its multiple plays rolled into one. We have retail buying hype train going (obviously, look at all the WSB posts here posted below), short-squeeze due to high cost of borrow, Gamma squeeze due to the MASSIVE options interest, 300M stock buyback by CEO to scare off the shorts, an unfair post-earnings plunge, plus good-ole\` company doing good things (making money).

We coming back for some of our loyal bagholders that have been holding UWMC since the last train to $14, hey guys remember to take profit this time ;)

It is now cost-prohibitive to use more shorts to keep the price low. The normal dirty tricks triple in price so become less-used. Shorts use this borrow price to determine feasibility and 93% is obviously unfeasible, THEY WILL COVER. Once one group starts covering and causes a spike, other shorts will rush to do the same.

It's a prisoner's dilemma and HF's want to cut each other's throats just as much as ours. Let's let them!!!

Many of these 7.50,9. 10, and 12 are OTM or barely ITM. and an early week spike to put 9c ITM would force MM's to hedge to delta-neutral...further pushing 10c and 12.50 c into hedge territory. This can quickly cause things to spiral out of control for shorts.

Stock BuyBack,

Ishbia is going to war with the shorts and his weapon of choice is a 300M stock buyback (similar to RKT's special dividend for the same purpose). The buyback could have started happening as early as May 11th.

Most of the float is owned by institutions and insiders so this buyback puts increased pressure of a heavily shorted (13%+) and heavily held float pool.

Retail is gorging on the float, institutions are holding the float, and Ishbia is buying the free float up. This is a recipe for ROCKET FUEL. WIth shorts paying 93%, they will stop shorting so the shares we are buying are REAL, not synthetic.

Make them buy real shares, from us, at 20$ each.

I am in UWMC for the long-term VALUE-PLAY and like the stock. I like the company., I like the CEO. I like the market position. I like the value. I ilke the stock.

I am loading up on 6/18 8c options. Options are important as we move up to force MM's to buy to remain market neutral.

Options do not pay unless we buy shares, so I suggest splitting half/half to each. options can cause MM's to balance risk and lead to large upswings but this cannot happen without buying pressure and the underlying spiking to necessitate balancing risk, which means we need to buy stocks as well.

Options are good for Gamma Squeeze/MM's balance buys (and profit) but shares are needed to keep the underlying JOOSED and keep those options deep ITM.

MIX IT UP!

This is the final call for the UWMC tendie train so get your fucking tickets and remember; Gravy costs extra,

3301,,2021-05-17 13:20:55,t3_neg3ey,,wallstreetbets,"$UWMC has become one of the most hyped stocks in the online investment community. Online activity appears to be ramping up after earnings and heading into May 21st option expiries. Since UWM is getting a lot of new eyes, it seemed like an appropriate time to share why some investors may consider UWM as a long term hold. 

UWM is a mortgage company that focuses exclusively on the broker channel. It‚Äôs the largest wholesale mortgage provider in the US and the second largest mortgage originator, behind Rocket Companies. 

It‚Äôs CEO is Mat Ishbia, who started as it‚Äôs 12th employee and who‚Äôs dad, Jeff, started the company as a side hustle. Mat and his brother own 94% of the company in Class D shares. The rest of the public float, \~100m Class A shares, are what is available for the public to purchase. 

# What trends are pushing $UWMC‚Äôs stock down? 

**The largest threat UWM is facing is raising interest rates**: 

About 75% of UWM income is related to refinance activity. The pandemic pushed rates to historic lows so most consumers were better off refinancing. Millions have done that, leading to record profit for mortgage providers like UWM and Rocket. 

**The strength of the broker channel:**

UWM is completely dependent on brokers finding business and closing loans. It doesn‚Äôt have any direct-to-consumer lending operations like Rocket does. 

**Short Interest:** 

Sophisticated investors are seeing 75% of income potentially attached to rate sensitive products (not all refi‚Äôs are rate sensitive like cash out), and are salivating. They think the market is under appreciating this headwind and shorting the stock. They have basically shorted all the shares they can. Friday the stock ended with 200 shares available and an insane 93% borrow rate. 

**SPAC:**

It is true that the SPAC market has softened recently. It is very reasonable to assume $UWMC is a part of that softening. It may not attract institutional investors because of the SPAC situation and the short period it has been publicly traded. Lots of other nice places to put institutional money.

**Competitors:** Mortgages are a mature market and competition is fierce. Rocket, LoanDepot and UWM mentioned a pricing war in their earnings. (LD statement). This will compress loan sale margins in the short term. 

**What trends are pushing $UWMC stock up?** 

**Short term retail pressure:**

there is a lot of retail attention on the potential short squeeze/gamma squeeze you could see this week in UWMC. My post is about UWM‚Äôs long term perspective, so I‚Äôll let [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ndcm0p/uwmc_is_a_powderkeg_low_float_high_short_huge/) take you further down that rabbit hole. Additionally, smart money is now tracking online sentiment, which can lead to increased institutional purchases. 

**Broker Channel Growth:** Mat has claimed two reasons for taking UWM public. He wanted access to the liquidity market and marketing exposure for the broker channel. For UWM to become the largest mortgage originator, Mat has targeted ‚Öì mortgages to be originated by brokers and UWM to own 50% of that channel by 2025/26. Currently UWM owns 36% of the broker channel with brokers originating 20% of all mortgages. Before the housing crisis in 2008, brokers were 58% of mortgage originations (Per Mat & Q1 2021 Earnings call), so it isn‚Äôt crazy to think they could get back to ‚Öì as it is growing: [https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum](https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum)

I had a loan with Rocket and tried to refinance with them. I then went through a mortgage broker and got the same loan for $4.5k cheaper in closing costs. This is because Rocket‚Äôs retail channel has 4% margins and it‚Äôs partnership network (includes wholesale, realtors, etc.) has 1% margins. 

**New Product Offerings:** 

UWM recently released new products like their jumbo loan. In earnings, Mat said he expects $2b in volume from Jumbo. They also added ARM‚Äôs, manufactured homes and expanded government programs. 

**Wholesale mortgage provider consolidation:** 

Mat said 3 of the top 25 wholesale lenders have been purchased in the last 90 days. This type of consolidation happens in mature markets by companies that are reaching for market share. THis could be a sign companies are under pressure to grow but cannot organically get market share from UWM. 

**UWM ‚ÄúAll In‚Äù Ultimatum:** 

Rocket and Fairway are priortizing other channels (cause the margins are so much higher) and trying to squeeze out brokers. UWM said if you work with those two, don‚Äôt work for us. The goal was to stand up for the broker channel WHILE putting some pressure on Rocket and Fairway‚Äôs partnership channel. This may have kickstarted the pricing war. 

**Aggressive Capital returns:** 

UWM pays an annual .40 dividend on its class A shares. That only costs them \~$42m/year. Remember their Q1 net income was $800m+. So their dividends hardly affect the balance sheet. The board just approved a $300/million share buyback as well that will reduce share count. Mat knows a thing or two about shorting stocks. He just sold at $10 and has authority to buy back with the current price under $8. The man successfully shorted his own company. What a legend. 

**Long Term Prediction:** 

I‚Äôm invested in UWM because I believe the capital returns will be aggressive during the upswing and the company will remain profitable in a downturn. With a 5%+ dividend return, share buyback, and \*potentially\* growing market share, UWM could be primed to overtake Rocket within the next few years.

3305,,2021-05-17 14:45:52,t3_nei5qk,,wallstreetbets,"As the cloud & big data continues to grow, as well as social media & 4k/8k video, data storage is becoming more important than ever.

Large social media sites take in a tremendous amount of data each day. This storage must not only be stored, but stored with redundancy as well as backups. Major sites such as Facebook and YouTube keep content that is over a decade old. Over time, the drives holding this content will fail and need to be replaced, leading to growing recurring demand as the size of the platform grows.

The need for storage has been growing for decades, but innovation in storage density and intense competition has limited profitability in the market in the past. That being said, there is reason to believe that the growth in storage density may stop keeping up with the growth in storage needs.

There is also reason to believe that transient growth in storage demand may drive higher Q2 earnings. A new digital currency, Chia, has gobbled up about 6 Exabytes worth of storage in the past 3 weeks, now growing at a rate of about 0.4 EiB per day(and rising). https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/netspace

For reference, about 288 Exabytes worth of hard drives were shipped in Q1 2021 https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hdd-shipments-in-q1-2021

Chia network size can be considered a lagging indicator for unexpected drive shipments. Generally, it can take a few weeks between when a drive is purchased and when it's actually accounted for on the network, as it takes time for it to be shipped, set up, and plotted. Chia wasn't even listed on exchanges until a couple weeks ago, so most of the growth seen is prior to Chia even having a price. At current prices, mining is incredibly profitable, with a $500 14 TB drive estimated to produce about $26 per day, and using very little power. So even if the network grows 10x to 60 Exabytes, it's still producing $3/day at current prices. So expect the surge in demand to continue.

I have seen many anecdotes of drive shortages over the past couple weeks. Reviewing sites like Amazon, I have also seen high capacity drives go out of stock or require lead times of a few weeks.

This may be a bit reminiscent of GPU shortages among Nvidia and AMD as miners seek to buy up anything they can.

If we project continued growth at 0.4 Exabytes a day in unexpected demand from proof of storage over the next 40 days, plus the 6 Exabytes added since April 20(leaving out first 3 weeks in quarter as they were likely logged last quarter), that's about 22 Exabytes to be added in Q2 that are not part of normal usage, or about an extra ~8% of Q1 demand.

What's perhaps most interesting is the impact this could have on margins. Unlike the GPUs used to mine which are consumer devices, the devices used for mining Chia includes enterprise grade hardware. Prices in the drive market are more flexible at the manufacturer level, and currently have much lower margins. If proof of storage currencies cause a drive shortage, it could have a significant impact on margins. Western digital sells about 40% of its drives through distributors, Seagate about 30%. Sales through these channels generally are very responsive to demand trends in terms of prices.

Seagate is also in a position to profit from this, but I'm a bit more worried about them as hard drive shipments have been on a long term decline and they aren't diversified into SSDs/flash like Western Digital is.

3310,,2021-05-17 16:06:02,t3_nek6rk,,wallstreetbets,"Hi all, going to keep this short as there is already some great DD on Myovant Sciences out there on Reddit and some recent articles, plus I‚Äôm not a financial advisor.

The EMA (EU medical agency like FDA) announced Myovant and Relugolix as up for review to be accepted for Marketing approval in the EU this week. This is a huge catalyst in the biotech industry, and due to their Pfizer partnership this could result in a 50m cash payment to Myovant as well.

They also have an FDA PDUFA deadline of June 1 for a second application (their first of three was approved in December). If approved this would result in a 100m cash payment from Pfizer.

Alone, these are major catalysts. Right now they stand to go back to back on these catalysts. The last time the company had one catalyst like this, **they were rocketed past $30 a share and gained a strategic partnership from Pfizer.**

Now those are two major catalysts within two weeks, **if FDA decides early, both could happen this week.**

Due to the triple threat data put up in clinical trials and the fact that they had this data peer reviewed and published in the New England journal of medicine, there is strong confidence of approval on the company‚Äôs end.

Last but not least, they have additional catalysts still inbound after. Including Part D and Medicare coverage expected by July 1. All encompassed with a possible buyout from sumitomo.

If you're looking for a good article that covers the basics, you can search the below. Theres also some great posts on reddit and stock twits. I am also happy to answer any questions.

*Why The Misunderstood Pfizer Deal Makes Myovant A Great Low-Risk Investment*

**Quick list of upcoming catalysts:**

THIS WEEK: EMA meets to possibly approve sale of orgovyx in Europe

By June 1: Deadline for FDA approval for a second use case (this could come early and will result in another 100m cash payment from Pfizer)

By July 1: Part d and Medicare coverage: also supposed to be obtained before July 1 for prostate cancer application

Pfizer optionality: Pfizer can opt in to have the rights to sell this in some markets, resulting in a 50m cash payment and royalties paid to myovant. Submission of relugolix for the treatment of endometriosis to the FDA

Catalysts that could happen at any time:  **BUYOUT** from Sumitomo ( aka Sumitovant) or other interested partner (See Urovant history. Sumi has a patent cliff in 2023 they are trying to patch with acquisitions, has purchased 4 of movants sister companies and already owns 53.5% of myovant).

Strategic acquisition of new drug candidates to further myovants pipeline.

**TLDR:**

EU and FDA approvals for drug candidates are expected within the next 2 weeks and could propel this to the moon.

It sounds like an impossibility, but there are simple ways to reading a price chart that enable you to come very close to predicting the direction and turning points of a stock. One of the most important ways is through the identification and marking of channel line patterns.

&#x200B;

[ Prices respect the channel lines ](https://preview.redd.it/fqzpk486qpz61.png?width=1067&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5b02809e77b0f9d4f8162cd558a98154a5aad8e)

Channels lines are one of the most important patterns found on a price chart. They enable you to find the broader trend, or overall direction prices are heading, which is crucial towards choosing the direction of your trade. Sticking with the trend - going long on an uptrend and short on a downtrend - aligns you with the higher probability direction, already setting yourself up for a probable trade.

They also enable you to anticipate and profit from areas where the price has a high likelihood of reversing through a ""bounce"" - where prices hit an upper or lower side of the channel and bounce off of the level like a ball, and heading into the opposite direction. These are key areas because unlike a random point in the chart, a channel line presents a point that has a higher probability of doing one thing over another - *this is an example of where ""edge"" comes from - finding scenarios where one outcome is more likely than the other, and betting on it.*

&#x200B;

[ Channel line pattern with bounces circled ](https://preview.redd.it/f0l668a7qpz61.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=658f753348044acec2cceeaa1dfbf4c6288ae0ff)

## How do you define a channel pattern?

A channel line pattern exists when prices are moving between two parallel trendlines. A trendline is a straight line drawn to connect several major turning points, or swings, in the price chart. When there are two identifiable trendlines that are parallel to each other forming a straight band, prices are *trading within a channel*.

&#x200B;

[ A trendline drawn off of the highs ](https://preview.redd.it/fcfpptc8qpz61.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc81911e78d6e9ee5012760fc53e05f6200513b2)

Trendlines and channels are drawings that highlight the foundational concept of understanding price charts - support and resistance. Support is a level that lies underneath the current price that historically has acted as a cushion for prices, slowing their momentum or causing them to turn right around. Resistance is a level that lies above the current price that historically has acted as a barrier for prices, slowing their momentum or causing a reversal. In this way, support and resistance are one and the same - they are levels that ""support"" or ""resist"", keeping prices within their confines until they lose their power.

&#x200B;

>Prices will often ""test"" support and resistance multiple times and the level will successfully hold, creating areas with a high probability of a bounce - therefore creating trading opportunities.

## How to Draw Channel Lines

So, trendlines connect two or more support or resistance zones, which are areas where prices reversed or showed slowing momentum. Channels are two parallel trendlines. With that, *how can you draw a channel line on a price chart*?

The first consideration is if there is a channel at all. Often, there are ample opportunities to draw trendlines - straight lines connecting s/r. However, it is less often that the chart shows another parallel trendline that price has interacted with. Thus, a textbook ""channel"" with prices neatly filling in the space and bouncing off of the lines is not as easy as it seems to find - **this actually makes the pattern more important, as the discovery of a true channel pattern can lead to very clean bounces and high probability, low risk trades.**

To draw a channel, first find a trendline. Connect important swing lows or highs, and try to find a way to draw a line that connects two or more of the swings, while keeping all of of the other price movement between the swings above the line.

&#x200B;

[ First trendline duplicated and dragged to mark swing lows ](https://preview.redd.it/ss3uggaaqpz61.png?width=561&format=png&auto=webp&s=56e6198235392485a05edaddc3f8d0da4d802d4c)

>A trendline is only as significant as the prices' respect for it - there is no validity to drawing a trendline that connects two swings, while is broken by three other spikes.

Once you've found the trendline, either duplicate the trendline you have just drawn, or if using a channel drawing tool, simply drag the parallel line to see if it can connect two more swings on the opposite side of the price movement.

It takes *a lot* of practice to begin to properly draw channel lines that are valid and are respected by prices. Drawing channel patterns that match historical price charts is hard - and drawing them in a way that can successfully anticipate *future* price movements is even more of a learned skill. This can only be improved by practicing drawing channels on many different charts.

## Types of Channel Lines

The direction of channel lines determine the type of channel pattern. A channel pointed at an upward sloping angle signals an uptrend. A channel pointed at a downward angle signals a downtrend. A channel with a horizontal slope signals a range.

&#x200B;

[ Uptrend ](https://preview.redd.it/s8h4o1xbqpz61.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=1df032e442d4dddf112e30748baedcff16656291)

A concept that is helpful in the identification of a channel's direction is the presence of swing highs and lows. If prices are making higher swings high (peaks) and higher swings low (troughs), chances are they are in an uptrend. If prices are making lower highs and lower lows, they are likely in a downtrend. If there are equal or mismatching swing lows and highs, and prices look more horizontal, a range is likely in play.

&#x200B;

[ Downtrend with channel break ](https://preview.redd.it/wovf3mvcqpz61.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0029bb3d64ea2cb1da1b122a2e477cd0ce827d)

In a trending market, sticking with the direction of the trend can put you on the higher probability side. Combined with an entry identified by the channel lines, this can form the basis of a trading strategy.

In a ranging market, where prices are simply bouncing between two horizontal support and resistance trendlines, any time prices approach or touch the channel lines can be a significant reversal area, where there is a higher probability of a bounce than a breakout through the line.

&#x200B;

[Range](https://preview.redd.it/6z1kj65eqpz61.png?width=1019&format=png&auto=webp&s=3196922b3ddd01cd806ca9f100aa01918bf0b766)

## The Midline and Channel Pattern Breaks

Many channel drawing tools can display a midline, or a line 50% away from both trendlines. This line can serve as an important secondary trendline or support/resistance zone, and often prices react to the midline in a less apparent, but still significant way. Additionally, sometimes prices will break the channel line and form a new high outside of the channel. When this happens, the broken trendline can sometimes become the midline of a wider channel that incorporates the new swing.

&#x200B;

[ Upper channel line turned into midline after breakout ](https://preview.redd.it/wz5gw1peqpz61.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=68d55d124e5799ccc86ac01d5f860786ef24d183)

*When prices break a channel line, it is a sign that the pattern is losing validity.* The trend may be losing steam or accelerating, based on if it breaks the lower or the upper line. A channel line pattern is most valid when there are no price breaks of the trendlines. When prices break the countertrend side (the lower line in an uptrend or the upper line in a downtrend), you can anticipate a reversal soon. When prices break the with-trend side, the trend has accelerated, and you may need to redraw your channel line. This can also be seen as an expenditure of momentum which can bring a trend channel back into a range or a reversal.

## How to Trade With Channel Lines

Because channel line patterns offer areas that have *a higher probability of moving in one direction over the other*, trading strategies can be formed around the pattern. After identifying a valid channel, a strategy may look to buy or sell as price touches the with-trend channel line, setting a stop loss level based on volatility, Fibonacci extensions, or a selection of indicators that can identify momentum and turning points. A take profit level could be determined by a significant support/resistance level, Fibonacci retracements, or indicators similar to those used in stop placement.

&#x200B;

[ A channel bounce trade with \>2:1 risk:reward ](https://preview.redd.it/f24xyxqfqpz61.png?width=1521&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae05a98cdfdfcfb19552fbff3bbb2b5b4331ba7a)

The key advantage to trading channel bounces is the **high risk to reward** offered. A tight stop loss can allow for a high R:R ratio even with a high probability, modest profit target level. Thus, the strategy utilizes *a high probability turning point, a tight stop loss, and a modest profit target* which culminates into a trading plan with a healthy win rate and risk to reward ratio.

Finally, an overlooked aspect of using channels:

&#x200B;

>Channel line patterns have one final key importance to trading - they let you know when to not be in. This helps to reinforce a golden rule of trading - only look to enter trades when there is a higher probability of one thing happening over the other. By watching your channel lines, you'll know when it's there.

&#x200B;

[ Channels force you to be patient and wait for the turning points ](https://preview.redd.it/d3asavogqpz61.png?width=1063&format=png&auto=webp&s=42024fd0d87b9df76edf37e8c33df58b4675684c)

3317,,2021-05-17 17:38:52,t3_nemlpe,,wallstreetbets,"So right now, the mainstream narrative is that inflation is going to run red hot mostly due to a rally in commodity prices. This inflation has the potential to be more than transitory, meaning it lasts more than a couple of quarters at most and will result in forcing the FED to raise rates and crash growth stocks. This is why tech stocks are underperforming while value, or more specifically, manufacturing and mining companies outperform (look at XME for example).

My question is if that is the case, then why are steel futures for U.S. Midwest Domestic Hot-Rolled Coil Steel going down [CME Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/ferrous/hrc-steel_quotes_globex.html)? Right now they peak in June at $1,520 a tonne before steadily going down for the foreseeable future.

Similar things can be said about other commodities such as copper, which remains relatively steady before gradually going down going into next year [Copper Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/base/copper_quotes_globex.html).

On the agriculture side, major commodities like corn appear to be peaking in the near future as well [Corn Futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/grain-and-oilseed/corn_quotes_globex.html).

So taking all of this into account, it would appear that the shape of the futures curves would indicate that commodity prices would peak in near future before gradually going down as supply meets demand. Shouldn't this mean that inflation is indeed transitory as the FED predicts? What am I missing here?

**Tl;Dr:** Futures are showing commodity prices going down in the near future which should drag down inflation rates. Are inflation fears misplaced?",nemlpe,Are Commodity Futures Going Against The Mainstream Inflation Narrative?

It's no secret that companies hire teams of people to brainstorm, draft, and send tweets, but even with the millions of dollars spent on this process it is rare for corporate twitter accounts to have big spikes in followers. Wendy's can obviously tweet some witty stuff that will get lots of likes and retweets, but this usually doesn't motivate most people to sign up for extra ads on their timeline by actually following these accounts.

Wingstop, however, cracked the code on Wednesday by denying the presence of ejaculate in their special white sauce. On Wednesday, one customer tweeted ""wingstop ranch gotta have nut in it no way it‚Äôs just that good"" to which Wingstop replied ""it's a special white sauce but it does not contain \[nut\]""

The rest of the conversation did not contain any more trade secrets on the Wingstop recipe, but it was notable in its own way.

[Twitter screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/2rmwspravqz61.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=090ca925fe321799a1934ea2edfc746480922449)

I rarely ever see companies with hundreds of thousands of followers (Wingstop has over 200k) receive over a 5% increase in Twitter followers over a week. Wingstop had a 10% gain in a matter of days.

The market seemingly reacted with disappointment to the lack of bodily fluids in the secret recipe as $WING fell 2% in the day following the exchange.",nerobc,"Wingstop ($WING) has 11% growth in Twitter followers, 3% drop in stock price after denying that their special white sauce contains human ejaculate"

3345,,2021-05-17 21:46:48,t3_nesw0u,,wallstreetbets,"Hey Guys, it's me again. I think you guys may remember me, after all I wrote an extensive series of DD over a month on UWMC through its trials and tribulations, in anticipation of it's breakout moment. You might even remember my YOLO, and remembered I continuously added to it. And that I eventually upped my margin to 13.5k on it. Well, I'm here to tell you that I'm not out. I bought more calls to average down, on earnings day, and I held them when they tanked to ten cents a pop. My only regret is that I didn't buy more then. Though I threw a bit more cash into shares!

Back then, I said the Theta Beta's would regret selling those calls, and it was one of the few plays where there wouldn't be IV Crush. I was right. Their probably a little sour. Sorry chaps, you usually are the one's making money at our expense. This time it's going to have to be the other way around....

Today, I had the chance to exit my options for a 47% profit roughly. Sell calls for a chunky profit after that. I said no. You know why? Because fuck the people who shorted an extremely profitable company to 6.26 dollars, that's why. The Fear, the Uncertainty, and the Doubt people expressed to me regarding this company espoused to me because of the actions of those people gave me an aneurysm. So fuck them. We're playing Pac Man people. The CEO of UWMC is reducing the float, and increasing the percentage of the float that is sold short while increasing buying pressure. We're buying up the stock to get the price to 9-10 because people bought options for 5-10 cents and they'll be in the money quite easily. And because of the rising volume, every day the CEO is able to buy more and more shares thanks to Rule 10B. The delta on the options is low, and they will need to hedge as the price heads steadily upward on Friday. Then the Shorts are going to be squeezed even further as the market makers hedge.

So no, I won't sell my options for a 10 or a 50% profit. I'm going to sell my options at a price I damn well want to. One that compensates me for the trouble that these people have given me. And so should you.

I understand people have taken profits, but honestly, at the price point they were selling at the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. Good for them though. Next time, could you at least sell deep ITM covered calls though lmao.

And for those people on the fucking fence. You jumped onto MVIS, you jumped into GME, and AMC, and all manners of companies that are either unprofitable or make very little money. But the fucking BOOMER stock is where you hesitate the fence?! The fucking (Eyy Lmaooo) Boomer stock, giving you a 4.87% dividend? The one that, if you somehow baghold can give you 10-15% cash returns through divitendies and covered calls until you get assigned at a strike that is profitable to you? The 10-15% backboard cash that can fund all your yolo's? That's the fucking stock you hesitate on? El LMAO. The companies margins will expand hard in a few months, and it's still hugely profitable at a less than 1 percent margin so yeah. Now if you were buying at 14 fucking bucks, you're a dumb ape, but yeah.

I'm fucking going to ride my options to a fucking profit margin that compensates me for the shit they pulled, or to a GUH. No in between. The Stock Buyback middle finger is just the fucking sweetener.

Matt Daddy, and I, and all the people who everyone called bag holders are going to skull fuck the shorters harder than they skull fucked UWMC's share price. They're going to fucking Guh their way into a fucking shoebox. Fuck em. I want me tendies well cooked, a side of fries, and a foot massage. And their going to give it to me. And to all of you who bought, and are buying UWMC.

This is not financial advice, this is a layup. But seriously, i'm not a financial advisor, and you do you with your money.

They did it with blockbuster but they were more vocal about it, and in turn their stock price plummeted for 4 years because the people found out what they did after they went under and hiked prices by 60%. *but that was soon forgotten*

\-Netflix still has a mail out service, it would be lucrative if they put GME out of business and take over

\- It would be great if Netflix could take over in person movie theaters..

The financial advisors whom I have spoken with have advised me to stay away from oil and coal and to start putting more and more money into renewable energy ETFs and companies. The two stocks that they projected would gain the most are listed below. 
- FuelCell Energy (FCEL) 
- iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN) 
These two are predicted to skyrocket under the Biden administration due to his push for renewable energy, especially if the Green New Deal is passed.

3354,,2021-05-18 01:34:15,t3_nexq9s,,wallstreetbets,"I don't normally play meme stocks - but I thought the GME technical setup was especially intriguing recently.

[GME TA](https://preview.redd.it/1tmj448o6sz61.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=1de6593bb253ff2a102250d3e4a97d521e0b3455)

The setup is a symmetrical triangle. Normally when continuation patterns come from downside - they have a bearish bias. However - we broke that red trendline  with an uptick in volume - this was a hint we were ready for an actual reversal. That trendline kept us in a downtrend for about 4 months. Not only that but...

**TODAY WE BROKE THE SYMMETRICAL TRIANGLE UP - WHICH MEANS ITS FULL SPEED AHEAD!**

Confluence between technicals generate the best signals.

This is the best the setup has looked since GME was at 10. Price target for this is 231.52 resistance initially, followed by 348.50. Breakout is invalid and play is dead if we get a daily close back under 158.11.

And... that's it.

I've been trading for a long time and only use patterns, trendlines & volume. Keep it simple. You don't need to waste 100 hours doing 15 paragraphs of DD for one swing trade - or look at 100 different indicators cherry picking the ones that say your position will go up.

***TL;DR*** \- GME actually looks good for once from an **unbiased** technical standpoint

***EDIT:*** Clarification - I wasn't speaking for GME as a whole when I said it was dead under 158.11 - I simply meant this setup in particular was no longer valid. It could always form a new one. I chose that level because it's the most significant one below the breakout point.",nexq9s,$GME TA - BIG BREAKOUT TODAY - SETUP LOOKS BETTER THAN IT EVER HAS

$CNK is AMCs largest competitor and is in the great business we know as movie theaters. When AMC last went crazy, CNK ran up over 56% in a few days from 22-27 of January to $27+. In the past month, AMC is up over 50%. CNK is roughly even. It is lagging behind and is due for a major pop on this AMC craze. It is a classically more boring stock that takes a big nudge to move.

Breaking out similar to AMC. Insanely strong volume shelf in low 20s (high demand) and above 1D 21MA. RSI has lots of room to run. 

**MARGIN**

CNK has a much lower implied volatility and actually allows for margin borrowing. This could be attractive depending on your risk appetite

**DILUTION/FINANCIALS**

CNK has almost no share dilution since the pandemic started, and it has been historically stronger than AMC from a traditional (retarded) financial perspective. AMCs market value growth has passed CNKs by many multiples over the past year. No reason she can't get some love.

Don't overthink it. We love this guy. Fuck you and lets make some money:

I know RKT guidance is down but

- They have a great current ratio

- They are profitable which is great during inflation times like now. Revenue and earnings are steady in guidance for the next two years 

- Possible addition to S&P 500

His $TSLA puts are generating the most interest from the media, but the position that stuck out most to me is his puts on $TLT, the 20-year treasury bond etf. It makes sense, if inflation really is upon us, the fed will have to raise rates soon. Higher rates = lower price per bond = lower $TLT. This seems way too intuitive and I feel like an idiot for not thinking of it a month ago, but obviously that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not Dr. Burry. I‚Äôm sure he got in a while ago and is already up a bunch of money, but I feel like there are still gains to be made in this trade in the months ahead.

The reason I‚Äôm posting is that $TLT has already come down a fair amount in the past month, but this still seems like an easy money play on inflation. Is there something I‚Äôm missing or is it really that simple? The 13F for Scion Asset Management doesn‚Äôt detail the strike price or expiration for the puts, but I‚Äôm thinking about going in for a few 1/21/22 $125 puts on $TLT.

They've even written some insightful pieces which panned out as per the analyses; CVNA (link below) performed well in the short-term as predicted, but the majority shareholder and CEO sold practically all of his shares four days ago, al in line with their poor long-term outlook.

A lot of the theorising focuses on the founding year of the company. Look... the profile on Bloomberg is for a different Glacier Capital LLC. There appear to be quite a few Glacier Capital LLCs. In the US, LLC names are not unique on a federal level. Unrelated companies in different states can have exactly the same name.

When we consider that the CEO of *the* Glacier Capital was still a university student in 2005, we can safely conclude this isn't a smoking gun and it's likely we're tripping up over unrelated companies.

Look at the dates. When the whole GME surge was first kicking off, Glacier Capital filed to register for a 'Legal Entity Identifier' (LEI) in order to comply with 'Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II' (MiFID II), which was a tightening of regulations within the EU in 2008. LEIs are required in order to comply with MiFID II, and MiFID II needs to be complied with in order to carry out certain high risk activities, including forms/scales of derivatives.

I am not a European financial services lawyer but considering the timing of everything, it seems reasonable to assume that the short positions may be real - and if new certs were put in place just for one series of positions, then it isn't crazy to think they might be especially large.

Again, *I am not saying* that this isn't an incestuous industry or that the capital isn't coming from known players. I am specifically begging you not to be a fucking dumbfuck because of one Reddit-cum-Sherlock post so that whatever dumbass decision you make next is at least a little less erratic.

The first known instance of the word ""meme stocks"" in the legal lexicon. Consolidated on April Fool's day, 2021.

What does this mean? It means that so many people filed lawsuits, including class actions, that they had to be consolidated into a single court as to avoid duplicitous litigation; very normal these days, but also indicative that this is a big deal legally speaking. Receiving an MDL assignment is considered very prestigious for a federal judge because it takes so much personal involvement and the cases often affect many, *many* people plus the state of the law more generally.

If you read those footnotes, you can see that some judges on the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (which is 7 very qualified federal judges) have recused themselves and others have had to renounce their claims (normal for judges) against the defendants to even participate, as they would have been members of the several putative actions.

UWMC is obviously picking up some steam here on Reddit with spillover into many other stock-related platforms (yahoo, twits, alpha, etc). That chatter will certainly help continue the push.

Up some change in Pre-market for what it's worth but should only get better throughout the day.  


This is a powder keg ready to go as soon as the 9c's go in the money. If we can exercise at 7.50 and 9 (EXERCISE FRIDAY 5/21 IF YOU CAN FRONT THE Cash!!!).   


I suggest exercising even if you are 0.01$ ITM.   


The Volume 05/17 was impressive at 17M (8M average) so there is certainly upwards pressure due to buying volume.   


Another 2 days like yesterday and those 9c start printing, then it is really off the races and not messing with 8,10% and instead watching a serious gap UP.  


Hopes some powder was saved for the push to 9c . I will be buying a few more shares today once some other options are sold for liquidity.   


Position:   
I am loaded up on 6/18 8c and LEAPS. I still really like UWMC long-term but this short-term profit potential is simply staggering.   


UWMC looks really good for breaking 9 by Thursday, we already have the 7.50c's ready to print from the push last week, then it's TO THE MOON as those options are exercised. 9c needs to hit this week to hit 12-14 (minimum) next week.

1.**The Fed will cap yields and do whatever it takes to support the economy and markets‚Äîi.e., much more dollar printing.**

**Let me dig in !**

The recent NFIB survey suggests we are only in an economic recovery, not an expansion.

NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

üì∑

https://preview.redd.it/bs5wfwf09vz61.png?width=907&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4fa466c127933694132c00e2b903ff01c5f2102

Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *‚Äúactually‚Äù* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *‚Äúdemand‚Äù* meets its operating cash flows.

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ew6w5tu19vz61.png?width=804&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bba4677ec15d513e78d6d19644722b133068a48

Businesses understand that the stimulus [***‚Äúpulled forward‚Äù***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)

much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***‚Äúcosts‚Äù*** **of** ***‚Äúlong-term employment‚Äù*** **for a** ***‚Äúshort-term‚Äù*** **artificial economic boost.**

The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.**¬†Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0bcfon349vz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=89b498f76db582407f08e593e10dc5692e6005f2

 

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive. Therefore **Fed will cap yields and do whatever it takes to support the economy , employment and markets.**

At the risk of repeating myself, the risk to the upside in the 30-Year yield is capped somewhere between 2.75-3.00%,

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w1cuikh69vz61.png?width=836&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b01f66a5badd3fc80e79abecd97096e309324a5

 

2. **Inflation will rise dramatically, and the risk is that it‚Äôll be worse than expected:**

We finally got ‚Äúofficial‚Äù confirmation in May that inflation has already begun to take off:

The headline CPI year-over-year increase at 4.2% was the highest since 2008. Energy prices rose 25% and gas prices 50%. Rising energy prices filter through to almost everything. Used car and truck prices were up 21%. Rents rose 2.1%. If you substitute home prices for rents, that number more than doubled.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1qccmij89vz61.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7c72ce894c8a9cddbf6a739715174d69d093229

 On top of all that, the CPI is widely understood to dramatically understate inflation, so the increases are much worse than the headline numbers. As I like to say, one just has to look at the performance of commodity futures over the past year, or go to Home Depot or the grocery store. It‚Äôs not rocket science. This will continue until the monetary and fiscal stimulus stops, small and medium-sized businesses return, and employment rises significantly. Don‚Äôt hold your breath, 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fjw00bba9vz61.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=a09d8f5b80ba4ea16d4fe02b812aa64a15ff8c3c

 

The month-over-month increases were far higher than expected, double in the case of the headline PPI. These are the prices that filter through to consumer prices over time‚Äîi.e., the CPI is likely going even higher.¬†

If that were not enough, wage inflation is on the rise, too, as employers struggle to get people off the couch who can otherwise live on their stimulus checks. Checks that are unlikely to be inflation indexed. Several States have already begun or are considering a ‚Äúreturn to work bonus‚Äù in order to get people to go back to work.

""Therefore I assume inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside .""

Conclusion and Goals :

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

The scenario to play out in weeks in precious Metals ;

 

Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and Gold and the metals soar.Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields.I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks.

Gold & silver's monthly defined 2021 road map still intact. Q2 and Q4 belong to silver, while gold will shine in Q3. For Silver q2 /2021 my targets are 42 Usd /ozz while gold 1.900 Usd/ozz .

I  have shared my thoughts on UWMC in past. The company announced Q1  earnings and while they look like they are below expectations it was  explained by the CEO that because of the speed of their execution, their  results are reflective of the higher rate environment already while  competitors are lagged.

During    the Q4 2020 earnings call he  had mused about options that would be on    the stable, special dividend,  buyback or raising the dividend.

**Feb Q4 Earnings Quote:**

The     Board did approve a dividend, a $0.10 quarterly dividend to be  paid    on  April 6 for all shareholders of record as of March 10. **We expect  this to be a regular quarterly dividend**.

And     so you guys know how we're thinking about this. Our balance sheet   is  a   fortress. And our current liquidity position is very strong, and    we   have access to the capital markets as well. The way we think  about   this   going forward is we're producing a lot of cash. We're  going to   maybe   be more profitable than some expected and be very  successful in   2021.   And **if we have excess cash that I and the Board deem is too much,  we will be delivering that back**. And whether we have to **change     the  dividend in the future, as in raise it or a special dividend,     those  things are definitely on the table or even buying back shares**.

**May Q1 Earnings Quote:**

As     you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of      $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a      record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I always  **explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special  dividend or a share buyback program**. As you guys have seen, we **concluded      share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward   shareholders.    We announced the authorization of $300 million share   buyback over the    next 24 months**.  And **quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that**.

**Then in answering a question from an analyst**

Doug    Harter -  Great. And then just in terms of capital return, you    mentioned sort of  the float. I  guess just how are you thinking about    kind of **how much of  the float  you'd be willing to take out and pacing around share  repurchase**?

Mat Ishbia -  Yes, Doug. So I'm learning these rules as we go **because at this stock  price, I'm a buyer, right**?    And so we'll buy shares as soon as tomorrow, I  think, as our legal    teams say we're allowed to do. And so I don't know  how many I can buy    and what I can do, but I'm very conscientious of the  float.  If the    float was not a concern, **we'd be more aggressive**. However,  **we     have authorization from the Board to buy up to $300 million, and I'm      going to take advantage of that opportunity while being  conscientious     of our partners in the float.**

TL/DR:     UWMC and their board have been looking at ways to give back to     shareholders. Instead of a short term cash out, they decided on a     buyback that they are planning to exercise immediately on so that they     can retire shares while the SP is low. They will NOT buy so much that   it   will ruin their float % for Russell. The CEO is aggressive, has    approval to spend $300 and he's going to take FULL advantage.  The CEO has stated he is a BUYER! They are  not   waiting, it's being deployed now.

Step 1 for me is zooming out. Despite the current market WELL actually held up quite strong - Beautiful Weekly close wicked just above the 20day SMA forming a nice support (Double bottom) in this 6.20 -8.20 channel. If we can snap this losing streak I think that might be our immediate next stop.

Stochastic's oversold and the RSI is closely following. On a shorter time frame we can see that bulls finished the Friday session off strong positioning us in a nice spot technically as we are sitting on the 20day SMA.

If we can open above 6.9 (50day SMA) I think we can close around that 7.14 (200day SMA) level which should line us up for that move out of the $6-$8 range and into the $10s and beyond.

Now funny enough what actually has me the most bullish this morning is looking at Friday alone. Selling pressure was suppressed by the bulls and it closed right near HOD above all major resistances.

UWMC is ready to pop!

I was in UWMC for the value play. It is a STEAL at 10$ on fundamentals anything below that is an insane deal. Even above 10 has a strong long-term argument.

Here is UWMC in a nutshell: heavily shorted, borrow costs skyrocketing, mortgage industry hit overly hard on fears of rising interest rates, the CEO Ishiba announces a 300M stock buyback, and shorts are QUAKING. UP 6% in premarket following being up 1-2% Friday. This puts at starting at $8 Monday with $9 being a CRITICAL Friday target for us.

All UWMC needs is a little unexpected retail buying pressure and it POPS! In truth this is not just a short squeeze, its multiple plays rolled into one. We have retail buying hype train going (obviously, look at all the WSB posts here posted below), short-squeeze due to high cost of borrow, Gamma squeeze due to the MASSIVE options interest, 300M stock buyback by CEO to scare off the shorts, an unfair post-earnings plunge, plus good-ole\` company doing good things (making money).

We coming back for some of our loyal bagholders that have been holding UWMC since the last train to $14, hey guys remember to take profit this time ;)

It is now cost-prohibitive to use more shorts to keep the price low. The normal dirty tricks triple in price so become less-used. Shorts use this borrow price to determine feasibility and 93% is obviously unfeasible, THEY WILL COVER. Once one group starts covering and causes a spike, other shorts will rush to do the same.

It's a prisoner's dilemma and HF's want to cut each other's throats just as much as ours. Let's let them!!!

Many of these 7.50,9. 10, and 12 are OTM or barely ITM. and an early week spike to put 9c ITM would force MM's to hedge to delta-neutral...further pushing 10c and 12.50 c into hedge territory. This can quickly cause things to spiral out of control for shorts.

Stock BuyBack,

Ishbia is going to war with the shorts and his weapon of choice is a 300M stock buyback (similar to RKT's special dividend for the same purpose). The buyback could have started happening as early as May 11th.

Most of the float is owned by institutions and insiders so this buyback puts increased pressure of a heavily shorted (13%+) and heavily held float pool.

Retail is gorging on the float, institutions are holding the float, and Ishbia is buying the free float up. This is a recipe for ROCKET FUEL. WIth shorts paying 93%, they will stop shorting so the shares we are buying are REAL, not synthetic.

Make them buy real shares, from us, at 20$ each.

I am in UWMC for the long-term VALUE-PLAY and like the stock. I like the company., I like the CEO. I like the market position. I like the value. I ilke the stock.

I am loading up on 6/18 8c options. Options are important as we move up to force MM's to buy to remain market neutral.

Options do not pay unless we buy shares, so I suggest splitting half/half to each. options can cause MM's to balance risk and lead to large upswings but this cannot happen without buying pressure and the underlying spiking to necessitate balancing risk, which means we need to buy stocks as well.

Options are good for Gamma Squeeze/MM's balance buys (and profit) but shares are needed to keep the underlying JOOSED and keep those options deep ITM.

MIX IT UP!

This is the final call for the UWMC tendie train so get your fucking tickets and remember; Gravy costs extra,

3908,,2021-05-17 13:20:55,t3_neg3ey,,wallstreetbets,"$UWMC has become one of the most hyped stocks in the online investment community. Online activity appears to be ramping up after earnings and heading into May 21st option expiries. Since UWM is getting a lot of new eyes, it seemed like an appropriate time to share why some investors may consider UWM as a long term hold. 

UWM is a mortgage company that focuses exclusively on the broker channel. It‚Äôs the largest wholesale mortgage provider in the US and the second largest mortgage originator, behind Rocket Companies. 

It‚Äôs CEO is Mat Ishbia, who started as it‚Äôs 12th employee and who‚Äôs dad, Jeff, started the company as a side hustle. Mat and his brother own 94% of the company in Class D shares. The rest of the public float, \~100m Class A shares, are what is available for the public to purchase. 

# What trends are pushing $UWMC‚Äôs stock down? 

**The largest threat UWM is facing is raising interest rates**: 

About 75% of UWM income is related to refinance activity. The pandemic pushed rates to historic lows so most consumers were better off refinancing. Millions have done that, leading to record profit for mortgage providers like UWM and Rocket. 

**The strength of the broker channel:**

UWM is completely dependent on brokers finding business and closing loans. It doesn‚Äôt have any direct-to-consumer lending operations like Rocket does. 

**Short Interest:** 

Sophisticated investors are seeing 75% of income potentially attached to rate sensitive products (not all refi‚Äôs are rate sensitive like cash out), and are salivating. They think the market is under appreciating this headwind and shorting the stock. They have basically shorted all the shares they can. Friday the stock ended with 200 shares available and an insane 93% borrow rate. 

**SPAC:**

It is true that the SPAC market has softened recently. It is very reasonable to assume $UWMC is a part of that softening. It may not attract institutional investors because of the SPAC situation and the short period it has been publicly traded. Lots of other nice places to put institutional money.

**Competitors:** Mortgages are a mature market and competition is fierce. Rocket, LoanDepot and UWM mentioned a pricing war in their earnings. (LD statement). This will compress loan sale margins in the short term. 

**What trends are pushing $UWMC stock up?** 

**Short term retail pressure:**

there is a lot of retail attention on the potential short squeeze/gamma squeeze you could see this week in UWMC. My post is about UWM‚Äôs long term perspective, so I‚Äôll let [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ndcm0p/uwmc_is_a_powderkeg_low_float_high_short_huge/) take you further down that rabbit hole. Additionally, smart money is now tracking online sentiment, which can lead to increased institutional purchases. 

**Broker Channel Growth:** Mat has claimed two reasons for taking UWM public. He wanted access to the liquidity market and marketing exposure for the broker channel. For UWM to become the largest mortgage originator, Mat has targeted ‚Öì mortgages to be originated by brokers and UWM to own 50% of that channel by 2025/26. Currently UWM owns 36% of the broker channel with brokers originating 20% of all mortgages. Before the housing crisis in 2008, brokers were 58% of mortgage originations (Per Mat & Q1 2021 Earnings call), so it isn‚Äôt crazy to think they could get back to ‚Öì as it is growing: [https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum](https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum)

I had a loan with Rocket and tried to refinance with them. I then went through a mortgage broker and got the same loan for $4.5k cheaper in closing costs. This is because Rocket‚Äôs retail channel has 4% margins and it‚Äôs partnership network (includes wholesale, realtors, etc.) has 1% margins. 

**New Product Offerings:** 

UWM recently released new products like their jumbo loan. In earnings, Mat said he expects $2b in volume from Jumbo. They also added ARM‚Äôs, manufactured homes and expanded government programs. 

**Wholesale mortgage provider consolidation:** 

Mat said 3 of the top 25 wholesale lenders have been purchased in the last 90 days. This type of consolidation happens in mature markets by companies that are reaching for market share. THis could be a sign companies are under pressure to grow but cannot organically get market share from UWM. 

**UWM ‚ÄúAll In‚Äù Ultimatum:** 

Rocket and Fairway are priortizing other channels (cause the margins are so much higher) and trying to squeeze out brokers. UWM said if you work with those two, don‚Äôt work for us. The goal was to stand up for the broker channel WHILE putting some pressure on Rocket and Fairway‚Äôs partnership channel. This may have kickstarted the pricing war. 

**Aggressive Capital returns:** 

UWM pays an annual .40 dividend on its class A shares. That only costs them \~$42m/year. Remember their Q1 net income was $800m+. So their dividends hardly affect the balance sheet. The board just approved a $300/million share buyback as well that will reduce share count. Mat knows a thing or two about shorting stocks. He just sold at $10 and has authority to buy back with the current price under $8. The man successfully shorted his own company. What a legend. 

**Long Term Prediction:** 

I‚Äôm invested in UWM because I believe the capital returns will be aggressive during the upswing and the company will remain profitable in a downturn. With a 5%+ dividend return, share buyback, and \*potentially\* growing market share, UWM could be primed to overtake Rocket within the next few years.

Large social media sites take in a tremendous amount of data each day. This storage must not only be stored, but stored with redundancy as well as backups. Major sites such as Facebook and YouTube keep content that is over a decade old. Over time, the drives holding this content will fail and need to be replaced, leading to growing recurring demand as the size of the platform grows.

The need for storage has been growing for decades, but innovation in storage density and intense competition has limited profitability in the market in the past. That being said, there is reason to believe that the growth in storage density may stop keeping up with the growth in storage needs.

There is also reason to believe that transient growth in storage demand may drive higher Q2 earnings. A new digital currency, Chia, has gobbled up about 6 Exabytes worth of storage in the past 3 weeks, now growing at a rate of about 0.4 EiB per day(and rising). https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/netspace

For reference, about 288 Exabytes worth of hard drives were shipped in Q1 2021 https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hdd-shipments-in-q1-2021

Chia network size can be considered a lagging indicator for unexpected drive shipments. Generally, it can take a few weeks between when a drive is purchased and when it's actually accounted for on the network, as it takes time for it to be shipped, set up, and plotted. Chia wasn't even listed on exchanges until a couple weeks ago, so most of the growth seen is prior to Chia even having a price. At current prices, mining is incredibly profitable, with a $500 14 TB drive estimated to produce about $26 per day, and using very little power. So even if the network grows 10x to 60 Exabytes, it's still producing $3/day at current prices. So expect the surge in demand to continue.

I have seen many anecdotes of drive shortages over the past couple weeks. Reviewing sites like Amazon, I have also seen high capacity drives go out of stock or require lead times of a few weeks.

This may be a bit reminiscent of GPU shortages among Nvidia and AMD as miners seek to buy up anything they can.

If we project continued growth at 0.4 Exabytes a day in unexpected demand from proof of storage over the next 40 days, plus the 6 Exabytes added since April 20(leaving out first 3 weeks in quarter as they were likely logged last quarter), that's about 22 Exabytes to be added in Q2 that are not part of normal usage, or about an extra ~8% of Q1 demand.

What's perhaps most interesting is the impact this could have on margins. Unlike the GPUs used to mine which are consumer devices, the devices used for mining Chia includes enterprise grade hardware. Prices in the drive market are more flexible at the manufacturer level, and currently have much lower margins. If proof of storage currencies cause a drive shortage, it could have a significant impact on margins. Western digital sells about 40% of its drives through distributors, Seagate about 30%. Sales through these channels generally are very responsive to demand trends in terms of prices.

Seagate is also in a position to profit from this, but I'm a bit more worried about them as hard drive shipments have been on a long term decline and they aren't diversified into SSDs/flash like Western Digital is.

The EMA (EU medical agency like FDA) announced Myovant and Relugolix as up for review to be accepted for Marketing approval in the EU this week. This is a huge catalyst in the biotech industry, and due to their Pfizer partnership this could result in a 50m cash payment to Myovant as well.

They also have an FDA PDUFA deadline of June 1 for a second application (their first of three was approved in December). If approved this would result in a 100m cash payment from Pfizer.

Alone, these are major catalysts. Right now they stand to go back to back on these catalysts. The last time the company had one catalyst like this, **they were rocketed past $30 a share and gained a strategic partnership from Pfizer.**

Now those are two major catalysts within two weeks, **if FDA decides early, both could happen this week.**

Due to the triple threat data put up in clinical trials and the fact that they had this data peer reviewed and published in the New England journal of medicine, there is strong confidence of approval on the company‚Äôs end.

Last but not least, they have additional catalysts still inbound after. Including Part D and Medicare coverage expected by July 1. All encompassed with a possible buyout from sumitomo.

If you're looking for a good article that covers the basics, you can search the below. Theres also some great posts on reddit and stock twits. I am also happy to answer any questions.

*Why The Misunderstood Pfizer Deal Makes Myovant A Great Low-Risk Investment*

**Quick list of upcoming catalysts:**

THIS WEEK: EMA meets to possibly approve sale of orgovyx in Europe

By June 1: Deadline for FDA approval for a second use case (this could come early and will result in another 100m cash payment from Pfizer)

By July 1: Part d and Medicare coverage: also supposed to be obtained before July 1 for prostate cancer application

Pfizer optionality: Pfizer can opt in to have the rights to sell this in some markets, resulting in a 50m cash payment and royalties paid to myovant. Submission of relugolix for the treatment of endometriosis to the FDA

Catalysts that could happen at any time:  **BUYOUT** from Sumitomo ( aka Sumitovant) or other interested partner (See Urovant history. Sumi has a patent cliff in 2023 they are trying to patch with acquisitions, has purchased 4 of movants sister companies and already owns 53.5% of myovant).

Strategic acquisition of new drug candidates to further myovants pipeline.

It sounds like an impossibility, but there are simple ways to reading a price chart that enable you to come very close to predicting the direction and turning points of a stock. One of the most important ways is through the identification and marking of channel line patterns.

&#x200B;

[ Prices respect the channel lines ](https://preview.redd.it/fqzpk486qpz61.png?width=1067&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5b02809e77b0f9d4f8162cd558a98154a5aad8e)

Channels lines are one of the most important patterns found on a price chart. They enable you to find the broader trend, or overall direction prices are heading, which is crucial towards choosing the direction of your trade. Sticking with the trend - going long on an uptrend and short on a downtrend - aligns you with the higher probability direction, already setting yourself up for a probable trade.

They also enable you to anticipate and profit from areas where the price has a high likelihood of reversing through a ""bounce"" - where prices hit an upper or lower side of the channel and bounce off of the level like a ball, and heading into the opposite direction. These are key areas because unlike a random point in the chart, a channel line presents a point that has a higher probability of doing one thing over another - *this is an example of where ""edge"" comes from - finding scenarios where one outcome is more likely than the other, and betting on it.*

&#x200B;

[ Channel line pattern with bounces circled ](https://preview.redd.it/f0l668a7qpz61.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=658f753348044acec2cceeaa1dfbf4c6288ae0ff)

## How do you define a channel pattern?

A channel line pattern exists when prices are moving between two parallel trendlines. A trendline is a straight line drawn to connect several major turning points, or swings, in the price chart. When there are two identifiable trendlines that are parallel to each other forming a straight band, prices are *trading within a channel*.

&#x200B;

[ A trendline drawn off of the highs ](https://preview.redd.it/fcfpptc8qpz61.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc81911e78d6e9ee5012760fc53e05f6200513b2)

Trendlines and channels are drawings that highlight the foundational concept of understanding price charts - support and resistance. Support is a level that lies underneath the current price that historically has acted as a cushion for prices, slowing their momentum or causing them to turn right around. Resistance is a level that lies above the current price that historically has acted as a barrier for prices, slowing their momentum or causing a reversal. In this way, support and resistance are one and the same - they are levels that ""support"" or ""resist"", keeping prices within their confines until they lose their power.

&#x200B;

>Prices will often ""test"" support and resistance multiple times and the level will successfully hold, creating areas with a high probability of a bounce - therefore creating trading opportunities.

## How to Draw Channel Lines

So, trendlines connect two or more support or resistance zones, which are areas where prices reversed or showed slowing momentum. Channels are two parallel trendlines. With that, *how can you draw a channel line on a price chart*?

The first consideration is if there is a channel at all. Often, there are ample opportunities to draw trendlines - straight lines connecting s/r. However, it is less often that the chart shows another parallel trendline that price has interacted with. Thus, a textbook ""channel"" with prices neatly filling in the space and bouncing off of the lines is not as easy as it seems to find - **this actually makes the pattern more important, as the discovery of a true channel pattern can lead to very clean bounces and high probability, low risk trades.**

To draw a channel, first find a trendline. Connect important swing lows or highs, and try to find a way to draw a line that connects two or more of the swings, while keeping all of of the other price movement between the swings above the line.

&#x200B;

[ First trendline duplicated and dragged to mark swing lows ](https://preview.redd.it/ss3uggaaqpz61.png?width=561&format=png&auto=webp&s=56e6198235392485a05edaddc3f8d0da4d802d4c)

>A trendline is only as significant as the prices' respect for it - there is no validity to drawing a trendline that connects two swings, while is broken by three other spikes.

Once you've found the trendline, either duplicate the trendline you have just drawn, or if using a channel drawing tool, simply drag the parallel line to see if it can connect two more swings on the opposite side of the price movement.

It takes *a lot* of practice to begin to properly draw channel lines that are valid and are respected by prices. Drawing channel patterns that match historical price charts is hard - and drawing them in a way that can successfully anticipate *future* price movements is even more of a learned skill. This can only be improved by practicing drawing channels on many different charts.

## Types of Channel Lines

The direction of channel lines determine the type of channel pattern. A channel pointed at an upward sloping angle signals an uptrend. A channel pointed at a downward angle signals a downtrend. A channel with a horizontal slope signals a range.

&#x200B;

[ Uptrend ](https://preview.redd.it/s8h4o1xbqpz61.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=1df032e442d4dddf112e30748baedcff16656291)

A concept that is helpful in the identification of a channel's direction is the presence of swing highs and lows. If prices are making higher swings high (peaks) and higher swings low (troughs), chances are they are in an uptrend. If prices are making lower highs and lower lows, they are likely in a downtrend. If there are equal or mismatching swing lows and highs, and prices look more horizontal, a range is likely in play.

&#x200B;

[ Downtrend with channel break ](https://preview.redd.it/wovf3mvcqpz61.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0029bb3d64ea2cb1da1b122a2e477cd0ce827d)

In a trending market, sticking with the direction of the trend can put you on the higher probability side. Combined with an entry identified by the channel lines, this can form the basis of a trading strategy.

In a ranging market, where prices are simply bouncing between two horizontal support and resistance trendlines, any time prices approach or touch the channel lines can be a significant reversal area, where there is a higher probability of a bounce than a breakout through the line.

&#x200B;

[Range](https://preview.redd.it/6z1kj65eqpz61.png?width=1019&format=png&auto=webp&s=3196922b3ddd01cd806ca9f100aa01918bf0b766)

## The Midline and Channel Pattern Breaks

Many channel drawing tools can display a midline, or a line 50% away from both trendlines. This line can serve as an important secondary trendline or support/resistance zone, and often prices react to the midline in a less apparent, but still significant way. Additionally, sometimes prices will break the channel line and form a new high outside of the channel. When this happens, the broken trendline can sometimes become the midline of a wider channel that incorporates the new swing.

&#x200B;

[ Upper channel line turned into midline after breakout ](https://preview.redd.it/wz5gw1peqpz61.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=68d55d124e5799ccc86ac01d5f860786ef24d183)

*When prices break a channel line, it is a sign that the pattern is losing validity.* The trend may be losing steam or accelerating, based on if it breaks the lower or the upper line. A channel line pattern is most valid when there are no price breaks of the trendlines. When prices break the countertrend side (the lower line in an uptrend or the upper line in a downtrend), you can anticipate a reversal soon. When prices break the with-trend side, the trend has accelerated, and you may need to redraw your channel line. This can also be seen as an expenditure of momentum which can bring a trend channel back into a range or a reversal.

## How to Trade With Channel Lines

Because channel line patterns offer areas that have *a higher probability of moving in one direction over the other*, trading strategies can be formed around the pattern. After identifying a valid channel, a strategy may look to buy or sell as price touches the with-trend channel line, setting a stop loss level based on volatility, Fibonacci extensions, or a selection of indicators that can identify momentum and turning points. A take profit level could be determined by a significant support/resistance level, Fibonacci retracements, or indicators similar to those used in stop placement.

&#x200B;

[ A channel bounce trade with \>2:1 risk:reward ](https://preview.redd.it/f24xyxqfqpz61.png?width=1521&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae05a98cdfdfcfb19552fbff3bbb2b5b4331ba7a)

The key advantage to trading channel bounces is the **high risk to reward** offered. A tight stop loss can allow for a high R:R ratio even with a high probability, modest profit target level. Thus, the strategy utilizes *a high probability turning point, a tight stop loss, and a modest profit target* which culminates into a trading plan with a healthy win rate and risk to reward ratio.

Finally, an overlooked aspect of using channels:

&#x200B;

>Channel line patterns have one final key importance to trading - they let you know when to not be in. This helps to reinforce a golden rule of trading - only look to enter trades when there is a higher probability of one thing happening over the other. By watching your channel lines, you'll know when it's there.

&#x200B;

[ Channels force you to be patient and wait for the turning points ](https://preview.redd.it/d3asavogqpz61.png?width=1063&format=png&auto=webp&s=42024fd0d87b9df76edf37e8c33df58b4675684c)

3924,,2021-05-17 17:38:52,t3_nemlpe,,wallstreetbets,"So right now, the mainstream narrative is that inflation is going to run red hot mostly due to a rally in commodity prices. This inflation has the potential to be more than transitory, meaning it lasts more than a couple of quarters at most and will result in forcing the FED to raise rates and crash growth stocks. This is why tech stocks are underperforming while value, or more specifically, manufacturing and mining companies outperform (look at XME for example).

My question is if that is the case, then why are steel futures for U.S. Midwest Domestic Hot-Rolled Coil Steel going down [CME Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/ferrous/hrc-steel_quotes_globex.html)? Right now they peak in June at $1,520 a tonne before steadily going down for the foreseeable future.

Similar things can be said about other commodities such as copper, which remains relatively steady before gradually going down going into next year [Copper Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/base/copper_quotes_globex.html).

On the agriculture side, major commodities like corn appear to be peaking in the near future as well [Corn Futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/grain-and-oilseed/corn_quotes_globex.html).

So taking all of this into account, it would appear that the shape of the futures curves would indicate that commodity prices would peak in near future before gradually going down as supply meets demand. Shouldn't this mean that inflation is indeed transitory as the FED predicts? What am I missing here?

**Tl;Dr:** Futures are showing commodity prices going down in the near future which should drag down inflation rates. Are inflation fears misplaced?",nemlpe,Are Commodity Futures Going Against The Mainstream Inflation Narrative?

‚ñ™ The economic re-opening driving omni-channel growth in digital ad spend  (see [this article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ad-spending-jumps-as-companies-ride-economic-rebound-11619784459) and [this](https://digiday.com/marketing/how-the-worlds-biggest-advertisers-are-spending-or-not-as-industries-adapt-to-the-coronavirus-pandemic-2/))

‚ñ™ Continued growth and evolution of the connected TV and over-the-top streaming ad markets . US CTV ad spending has a total of $8.11 billion and expected to increase to $11.36 billion in 2021 (up\~40%) and continue to grow (see [this](https://www.emarketer.com/content/us-connected-tv-advertising-2020) and [this](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1048897/connected-tv-ad-spend-usa/))

‚ñ™ Continued ad spend consolidation by agencies and advertisers.

The company provided guidance that ""We expect to deliver outsized revenue growth in 2021 as well ... due to convergence of three key trends. ""\[paraphrased\]

There are more exciting details in their SEC fillings if you want more data.

&#x200B;

The company stock is currently heavily shorted and stock price has been on a landslide lately. I believe the risk-reward ratio here deserves a mention and it's time to build a position and reap the reward later. Of course I might miss some details and would appreciate a callout if you see it.

Recently been looking at stock named $ANAT. American National Insurance. They took a large hit at the beginning of covid for obvious reasons... they have a diverse portfolio of insurance policies which is counter to what other insurance companies are going for. Down below I will link some information about this company. I like doing a form of DD that lets people make their own conclusions. Fuck confirmation bias.

It's no secret that companies hire teams of people to brainstorm, draft, and send tweets, but even with the millions of dollars spent on this process it is rare for corporate twitter accounts to have big spikes in followers. Wendy's can obviously tweet some witty stuff that will get lots of likes and retweets, but this usually doesn't motivate most people to sign up for extra ads on their timeline by actually following these accounts.

Wingstop, however, cracked the code on Wednesday by denying the presence of ejaculate in their special white sauce. On Wednesday, one customer tweeted ""wingstop ranch gotta have nut in it no way it‚Äôs just that good"" to which Wingstop replied ""it's a special white sauce but it does not contain \[nut\]""

The rest of the conversation did not contain any more trade secrets on the Wingstop recipe, but it was notable in its own way.

[Twitter screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/2rmwspravqz61.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=090ca925fe321799a1934ea2edfc746480922449)

I rarely ever see companies with hundreds of thousands of followers (Wingstop has over 200k) receive over a 5% increase in Twitter followers over a week. Wingstop had a 10% gain in a matter of days.

The market seemingly reacted with disappointment to the lack of bodily fluids in the secret recipe as $WING fell 2% in the day following the exchange.",nerobc,"Wingstop ($WING) has 11% growth in Twitter followers, 3% drop in stock price after denying that their special white sauce contains human ejaculate"

I think you guys may remember me, after all I wrote an extensive series of DD over a month on UWMC through its trials and tribulations, in anticipation of it's breakout moment. You might even remember my YOLO, and remembered I continuously added to it. And that I eventually upped my margin to 13.5k on it. Well, I'm here to tell you that I'm not out. I bought more calls to average down, on earnings day, and I held them when they tanked to ten cents a pop. My only regret is that I didn't buy more then. Though I threw a bit more cash into shares!

Back then, I said the Theta Beta's would regret selling those calls, and it was one of the few plays where there wouldn't be IV Crush. I was right. Their probably a little sour. Sorry chaps, you usually are the one's making money at our expense. This time it's going to have to be the other way around....

Today, I had the chance to exit my options for a 47% profit roughly. Sell calls for a chunky profit after that. I said no. You know why? Because fuck the people who shorted an extremely profitable company to 6.26 dollars, that's why. The Fear, the Uncertainty, and the Doubt people expressed to me regarding this company espoused to me because of the actions of those people gave me an aneurysm. So fuck them. We're playing Pac Man people. The CEO of UWMC is reducing the float, and increasing the percentage of the float that is sold short while increasing buying pressure. We're buying up the stock to get the price to 9-10 because people bought options for 5-10 cents and they'll be in the money quite easily. And because of the rising volume, every day the CEO is able to buy more and more shares thanks to Rule 10B. The delta on the options is low, and they will need to hedge as the price heads steadily upward on Friday. Then the Shorts are going to be squeezed even further as the market makers hedge.

So no, I won't sell my options for a 10 or a 50% profit. I'm going to sell my options at a price I damn well want to. One that compensates me for the trouble that these people have given me. And so should you.

I understand people have taken profits, but honestly, at the price point they were selling at the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. Good for them though. Next time, could you at least sell deep ITM covered calls though lmao.

And for those people on the fucking fence. You jumped onto MVIS, you jumped into GME, and AMC, and all manners of companies that are either unprofitable or make very little money. But the fucking BOOMER stock is where you hesitate the fence?! The fucking (Eyy Lmaooo) Boomer stock, giving you a 4.87% dividend? The one that, if you somehow baghold can give you 10-15% cash returns through divitendies and covered calls until you get assigned at a strike that is profitable to you? The 10-15% backboard cash that can fund all your yolo's? That's the fucking stock you hesitate on? El LMAO. The companies margins will expand hard in a few months, and it's still hugely profitable at a less than 1 percent margin so yeah. Now if you were buying at 14 fucking bucks, you're a dumb ape, but yeah.

I'm fucking going to ride my options to a fucking profit margin that compensates me for the shit they pulled, or to a GUH. No in between. The Stock Buyback middle finger is just the fucking sweetener.

Matt Daddy, and I, and all the people who everyone called bag holders are going to skull fuck the shorters harder than they skull fucked UWMC's share price. They're going to fucking Guh their way into a fucking shoebox. Fuck em. I want me tendies well cooked, a side of fries, and a foot massage. And their going to give it to me. And to all of you who bought, and are buying UWMC.

3961,,2021-05-18 01:34:15,t3_nexq9s,,wallstreetbets,"I don't normally play meme stocks - but I thought the GME technical setup was especially intriguing recently.

The setup is a symmetrical triangle. Normally when continuation patterns come from downside - they have a bearish bias. However - we broke that red trendline  with an uptick in volume - this was a hint we were ready for an actual reversal. That trendline kept us in a downtrend for about 4 months. Not only that but...

**TODAY WE BROKE THE SYMMETRICAL TRIANGLE UP - WHICH MEANS ITS FULL SPEED AHEAD!**

Confluence between technicals generate the best signals.

This is the best the setup has looked since GME was at 10. Price target for this is 231.52 resistance initially, followed by 348.50. Breakout is invalid and play is dead if we get a daily close back under 158.11.

And... that's it.

I've been trading for a long time and only use patterns, trendlines & volume. Keep it simple. You don't need to waste 100 hours doing 15 paragraphs of DD for one swing trade - or look at 100 different indicators cherry picking the ones that say your position will go up.

***TL;DR*** \- GME actually looks good for once from an **unbiased** technical standpoint

***EDIT:*** Clarification - I wasn't speaking for GME as a whole when I said it was dead under 158.11 - I simply meant this setup in particular was no longer valid. It could always form a new one. I chose that level because it's the most significant one below the breakout point.",nexq9s,$GME TA - BIG BREAKOUT TODAY - SETUP LOOKS BETTER THAN IT EVER HAS

$CNK is AMCs largest competitor and is in the great business we know as movie theaters. When AMC last went crazy, CNK ran up over 56% in a few days from 22-27 of January to $27+. In the past month, AMC is up over 50%. CNK is roughly even. It is lagging behind and is due for a major pop on this AMC craze. It is a classically more boring stock that takes a big nudge to move.

Breaking out similar to AMC. Insanely strong volume shelf in low 20s (high demand) and above 1D 21MA. RSI has lots of room to run. 

**MARGIN**

CNK has a much lower implied volatility and actually allows for margin borrowing. This could be attractive depending on your risk appetite

**DILUTION/FINANCIALS**

CNK has almost no share dilution since the pandemic started, and it has been historically stronger than AMC from a traditional (retarded) financial perspective. AMCs market value growth has passed CNKs by many multiples over the past year. No reason she can't get some love.

I know RKT guidance is down but 


- the P/E ratio of under 7 is extremely cheap

- They have a great current ratio

- They are profitable which is great during inflation times like now. Revenue and earnings are steady in guidance for the next two years 

- Possible addition to S&P 500

His $TSLA puts are generating the most interest from the media, but the position that stuck out most to me is his puts on $TLT, the 20-year treasury bond etf. It makes sense, if inflation really is upon us, the fed will have to raise rates soon. Higher rates = lower price per bond = lower $TLT. This seems way too intuitive and I feel like an idiot for not thinking of it a month ago, but obviously that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not Dr. Burry. I‚Äôm sure he got in a while ago and is already up a bunch of money, but I feel like there are still gains to be made in this trade in the months ahead.

The reason I‚Äôm posting is that $TLT has already come down a fair amount in the past month, but this still seems like an easy money play on inflation. Is there something I‚Äôm missing or is it really that simple? The 13F for Scion Asset Management doesn‚Äôt detail the strike price or expiration for the puts, but I‚Äôm thinking about going in for a few 1/21/22 $125 puts on $TLT. The fed claims this inflation is transitory, but I don‚Äôt think anyone on the street buys it. I think rates have to come up at least a little bit sometime between now and next January.

Glacier Capital exists. That sentence isn't going to make me any friends, but your wallet needs to hear it. They've even written some insightful pieces which panned out as per the analyses; CVNA (link below) performed well in the short-term as predicted, but the majority shareholder and CEO sold practically all of his shares four days ago, al in line with their poor long-term outlook.

A lot of the theorising focuses on the founding year of the company. Look... the profile on Bloomberg is for a different Glacier Capital LLC. There appear to be quite a few Glacier Capital LLCs. In the US, LLC names are not unique on a federal level. Unrelated companies in different states can have exactly the same name.

When we consider that the CEO of *the* Glacier Capital was still a university student in 2005, we can safely conclude this isn't a smoking gun and it's likely we're tripping up over unrelated companies.

Look at the dates. When the whole GME surge was first kicking off, Glacier Capital filed to register for a 'Legal Entity Identifier' (LEI) in order to comply with 'Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II' (MiFID II), which was a tightening of regulations within the EU in 2008. LEIs are required in order to comply with MiFID II, and MiFID II needs to be complied with in order to carry out certain high risk activities, including forms/scales of derivatives.

I am not a European financial services lawyer but considering the timing of everything, it seems reasonable to assume that the short positions may be real - and if new certs were put in place just for one series of positions, then it isn't crazy to think they might be especially large.

Again, *I am not saying* that this isn't an incestuous industry or that the capital isn't coming from known players.

1.**The Fed will cap yields and do whatever it takes to support the economy and markets‚Äîi.e., much more dollar printing.**

**Let me dig in !**

The recent NFIB survey suggests we are only in an economic recovery, not an expansion.

NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *‚Äúactually‚Äù* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *‚Äúdemand‚Äù* meets its operating cash flows.

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ew6w5tu19vz61.png?width=804&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bba4677ec15d513e78d6d19644722b133068a48

Businesses understand that the stimulus [***‚Äúpulled forward‚Äù***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)

much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***‚Äúcosts‚Äù*** **of** ***‚Äúlong-term employment‚Äù*** **for a** ***‚Äúshort-term‚Äù*** **artificial economic boost.**

The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.**¬†Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0bcfon349vz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=89b498f76db582407f08e593e10dc5692e6005f2

 

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive. Therefore **Fed will cap yields and do whatever it takes to support the economy , employment and markets.**

At the risk of repeating myself, the risk to the upside in the 30-Year yield is capped somewhere between 2.75-3.00%,

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w1cuikh69vz61.png?width=836&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b01f66a5badd3fc80e79abecd97096e309324a5

 

2. **Inflation will rise dramatically, and the risk is that it‚Äôll be worse than expected:**

We finally got ‚Äúofficial‚Äù confirmation in May that inflation has already begun to take off:

The headline CPI year-over-year increase at 4.2% was the highest since 2008. Energy prices rose 25% and gas prices 50%. Rising energy prices filter through to almost everything. Used car and truck prices were up 21%. Rents rose 2.1%. If you substitute home prices for rents, that number more than doubled.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1qccmij89vz61.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7c72ce894c8a9cddbf6a739715174d69d093229

 On top of all that, the CPI is widely understood to dramatically understate inflation, so the increases are much worse than the headline numbers. As I like to say, one just has to look at the performance of commodity futures over the past year, or go to Home Depot or the grocery store. It‚Äôs not rocket science. This will continue until the monetary and fiscal stimulus stops, small and medium-sized businesses return, and employment rises significantly. Don‚Äôt hold your breath, 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fjw00bba9vz61.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=a09d8f5b80ba4ea16d4fe02b812aa64a15ff8c3c

 

The month-over-month increases were far higher than expected, double in the case of the headline PPI. These are the prices that filter through to consumer prices over time‚Äîi.e., the CPI is likely going even higher.¬†

If that were not enough, wage inflation is on the rise, too, as employers struggle to get people off the couch who can otherwise live on their stimulus checks. Checks that are unlikely to be inflation indexed. Several States have already begun or are considering a ‚Äúreturn to work bonus‚Äù in order to get people to go back to work.

""Therefore I assume inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside .""

Conclusion and Goals :

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

The scenario to play out in weeks in precious Metals ;

 

Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and Gold and the metals soar.Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields.I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks.

Gold & silver's monthly defined 2021 road map still intact. Q2 and Q4 belong to silver, while gold will shine in Q3. For Silver q2 /2021 my targets are 42 Usd /ozz while gold 1.900 Usd/ozz .

Step 1 for me is zooming out. Despite the current market WELL actually held up quite strong - Beautiful Weekly close wicked just above the 20day SMA forming a nice support (Double bottom) in this 6.20 -8.20 channel. If we can snap this losing streak I think that might be our immediate next stop.

Stochastic's oversold and the RSI is closely following. On a shorter time frame we can see that bulls finished the Friday session off strong positioning us in a nice spot technically as we are sitting on the 20day SMA.

If we can open above 6.9 (50day SMA) I think we can close around that 7.14 (200day SMA) level which should line us up for that move out of the $6-$8 range and into the $10s and beyond.

Now funny enough what actually has me the most bullish this morning is looking at Friday alone. Selling pressure was suppressed by the bulls and it closed right near HOD above all major resistances.

UWMC is ready to pop!

I was in UWMC for the value play. It is a STEAL at 10$ on fundamentals anything below that is an insane deal. Even above 10 has a strong long-term argument.

Here is UWMC in a nutshell: heavily shorted, borrow costs skyrocketing, mortgage industry hit overly hard on fears of rising interest rates, the CEO Ishiba announces a 300M stock buyback, and shorts are QUAKING. UP 6% in premarket following being up 1-2% Friday. This puts at starting at $8 Monday with $9 being a CRITICAL Friday target for us.

All UWMC needs is a little unexpected retail buying pressure and it POPS! In truth this is not just a short squeeze, its multiple plays rolled into one. We have retail buying hype train going (obviously, look at all the WSB posts here posted below), short-squeeze due to high cost of borrow, Gamma squeeze due to the MASSIVE options interest, 300M stock buyback by CEO to scare off the shorts, an unfair post-earnings plunge, plus good-ole\` company doing good things (making money).

We coming back for some of our loyal bagholders that have been holding UWMC since the last train to $14, hey guys remember to take profit this time ;)

It is now cost-prohibitive to use more shorts to keep the price low. The normal dirty tricks triple in price so become less-used. Shorts use this borrow price to determine feasibility and 93% is obviously unfeasible, THEY WILL COVER. Once one group starts covering and causes a spike, other shorts will rush to do the same.

It's a prisoner's dilemma and HF's want to cut each other's throats just as much as ours. Let's let them!!!

Many of these 7.50,9. 10, and 12 are OTM or barely ITM. and an early week spike to put 9c ITM would force MM's to hedge to delta-neutral...further pushing 10c and 12.50 c into hedge territory. This can quickly cause things to spiral out of control for shorts.

Stock BuyBack,

Ishbia is going to war with the shorts and his weapon of choice is a 300M stock buyback (similar to RKT's special dividend for the same purpose). The buyback could have started happening as early as May 11th.

Most of the float is owned by institutions and insiders so this buyback puts increased pressure of a heavily shorted (13%+) and heavily held float pool.

Retail is gorging on the float, institutions are holding the float, and Ishbia is buying the free float up. This is a recipe for ROCKET FUEL. WIth shorts paying 93%, they will stop shorting so the shares we are buying are REAL, not synthetic.

Make them buy real shares, from us, at 20$ each.

I am in UWMC for the long-term VALUE-PLAY and like the stock. I like the company., I like the CEO. I like the market position. I like the value. I ilke the stock.

I am loading up on 6/18 8c options. Options are important as we move up to force MM's to buy to remain market neutral.

Options do not pay unless we buy shares, so I suggest splitting half/half to each. options can cause MM's to balance risk and lead to large upswings but this cannot happen without buying pressure and the underlying spiking to necessitate balancing risk, which means we need to buy stocks as well.

Options are good for Gamma Squeeze/MM's balance buys (and profit) but shares are needed to keep the underlying JOOSED and keep those options deep ITM.

MIX IT UP!

This is the final call for the UWMC tendie train so get your fucking tickets and remember; Gravy costs extra,

4315,,2021-05-17 13:20:55,t3_neg3ey,,wallstreetbets,"$UWMC has become one of the most hyped stocks in the online investment community. Online activity appears to be ramping up after earnings and heading into May 21st option expiries. Since UWM is getting a lot of new eyes, it seemed like an appropriate time to share why some investors may consider UWM as a long term hold. 

UWM is a mortgage company that focuses exclusively on the broker channel. It‚Äôs the largest wholesale mortgage provider in the US and the second largest mortgage originator, behind Rocket Companies. 

It‚Äôs CEO is Mat Ishbia, who started as it‚Äôs 12th employee and who‚Äôs dad, Jeff, started the company as a side hustle. Mat and his brother own 94% of the company in Class D shares. The rest of the public float, \~100m Class A shares, are what is available for the public to purchase. 

# What trends are pushing $UWMC‚Äôs stock down? 

**The largest threat UWM is facing is raising interest rates**: 

About 75% of UWM income is related to refinance activity. The pandemic pushed rates to historic lows so most consumers were better off refinancing. Millions have done that, leading to record profit for mortgage providers like UWM and Rocket. 

**The strength of the broker channel:**

UWM is completely dependent on brokers finding business and closing loans. It doesn‚Äôt have any direct-to-consumer lending operations like Rocket does. 

**Short Interest:** 

Sophisticated investors are seeing 75% of income potentially attached to rate sensitive products (not all refi‚Äôs are rate sensitive like cash out), and are salivating. They think the market is under appreciating this headwind and shorting the stock. They have basically shorted all the shares they can. Friday the stock ended with 200 shares available and an insane 93% borrow rate. 

**SPAC:**

It is true that the SPAC market has softened recently. It is very reasonable to assume $UWMC is a part of that softening. It may not attract institutional investors because of the SPAC situation and the short period it has been publicly traded. Lots of other nice places to put institutional money.

**Competitors:** Mortgages are a mature market and competition is fierce. Rocket, LoanDepot and UWM mentioned a pricing war in their earnings. (LD statement). This will compress loan sale margins in the short term. 

**What trends are pushing $UWMC stock up?** 

**Short term retail pressure:**

there is a lot of retail attention on the potential short squeeze/gamma squeeze you could see this week in UWMC. My post is about UWM‚Äôs long term perspective, so I‚Äôll let [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ndcm0p/uwmc_is_a_powderkeg_low_float_high_short_huge/) take you further down that rabbit hole. Additionally, smart money is now tracking online sentiment, which can lead to increased institutional purchases. 

**Broker Channel Growth:** Mat has claimed two reasons for taking UWM public. He wanted access to the liquidity market and marketing exposure for the broker channel. For UWM to become the largest mortgage originator, Mat has targeted ‚Öì mortgages to be originated by brokers and UWM to own 50% of that channel by 2025/26. Currently UWM owns 36% of the broker channel with brokers originating 20% of all mortgages. Before the housing crisis in 2008, brokers were 58% of mortgage originations (Per Mat & Q1 2021 Earnings call), so it isn‚Äôt crazy to think they could get back to ‚Öì as it is growing: [https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum](https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum)

I had a loan with Rocket and tried to refinance with them. I then went through a mortgage broker and got the same loan for $4.5k cheaper in closing costs. This is because Rocket‚Äôs retail channel has 4% margins and it‚Äôs partnership network (includes wholesale, realtors, etc.) has 1% margins. 

**New Product Offerings:** 

UWM recently released new products like their jumbo loan. In earnings, Mat said he expects $2b in volume from Jumbo. They also added ARM‚Äôs, manufactured homes and expanded government programs. 

**Wholesale mortgage provider consolidation:** 

Mat said 3 of the top 25 wholesale lenders have been purchased in the last 90 days. This type of consolidation happens in mature markets by companies that are reaching for market share. THis could be a sign companies are under pressure to grow but cannot organically get market share from UWM. 

**UWM ‚ÄúAll In‚Äù Ultimatum:** 

Rocket and Fairway are priortizing other channels (cause the margins are so much higher) and trying to squeeze out brokers. UWM said if you work with those two, don‚Äôt work for us. The goal was to stand up for the broker channel WHILE putting some pressure on Rocket and Fairway‚Äôs partnership channel. This may have kickstarted the pricing war. 

**Aggressive Capital returns:** 

UWM pays an annual .40 dividend on its class A shares. That only costs them \~$42m/year. Remember their Q1 net income was $800m+. So their dividends hardly affect the balance sheet. The board just approved a $300/million share buyback as well that will reduce share count. Mat knows a thing or two about shorting stocks. He just sold at $10 and has authority to buy back with the current price under $8. The man successfully shorted his own company. What a legend. 

**Long Term Prediction:** 

I‚Äôm invested in UWM because I believe the capital returns will be aggressive during the upswing and the company will remain profitable in a downturn. With a 5%+ dividend return, share buyback, and \*potentially\* growing market share, UWM could be primed to overtake Rocket within the next few years.

4319,,2021-05-17 14:45:52,t3_nei5qk,,wallstreetbets,"As the cloud & big data continues to grow, as well as social media & 4k/8k video, data storage is becoming more important than ever.

Large social media sites take in a tremendous amount of data each day. This storage must not only be stored, but stored with redundancy as well as backups. Major sites such as Facebook and YouTube keep content that is over a decade old. Over time, the drives holding this content will fail and need to be replaced, leading to growing recurring demand as the size of the platform grows.

The need for storage has been growing for decades, but innovation in storage density and intense competition has limited profitability in the market in the past. That being said, there is reason to believe that the growth in storage density may stop keeping up with the growth in storage needs.

There is also reason to believe that transient growth in storage demand may drive higher Q2 earnings. A new digital currency, Chia, has gobbled up about 6 Exabytes worth of storage in the past 3 weeks, now growing at a rate of about 0.4 EiB per day(and rising). https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/netspace

For reference, about 288 Exabytes worth of hard drives were shipped in Q1 2021 https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hdd-shipments-in-q1-2021

Chia network size can be considered a lagging indicator for unexpected drive shipments. Generally, it can take a few weeks between when a drive is purchased and when it's actually accounted for on the network, as it takes time for it to be shipped, set up, and plotted. Chia wasn't even listed on exchanges until a couple weeks ago, so most of the growth seen is prior to Chia even having a price. At current prices, mining is incredibly profitable, with a $500 14 TB drive estimated to produce about $26 per day, and using very little power. So even if the network grows 10x to 60 Exabytes, it's still producing $3/day at current prices. So expect the surge in demand to continue.

I have seen many anecdotes of drive shortages over the past couple weeks. Reviewing sites like Amazon, I have also seen high capacity drives go out of stock or require lead times of a few weeks.

This may be a bit reminiscent of GPU shortages among Nvidia and AMD as miners seek to buy up anything they can.

If we project continued growth at 0.4 Exabytes a day in unexpected demand from proof of storage over the next 40 days, plus the 6 Exabytes added since April 20(leaving out first 3 weeks in quarter as they were likely logged last quarter), that's about 22 Exabytes to be added in Q2 that are not part of normal usage, or about an extra ~8% of Q1 demand.

What's perhaps most interesting is the impact this could have on margins. Unlike the GPUs used to mine which are consumer devices, the devices used for mining Chia includes enterprise grade hardware. Prices in the drive market are more flexible at the manufacturer level, and currently have much lower margins. If proof of storage currencies cause a drive shortage, it could have a significant impact on margins. Western digital sells about 40% of its drives through distributors, Seagate about 30%. Sales through these channels generally are very responsive to demand trends in terms of prices.

Seagate is also in a position to profit from this, but I'm a bit more worried about them as hard drive shipments have been on a long term decline and they aren't diversified into SSDs/flash like Western Digital is.

4324,,2021-05-17 16:06:02,t3_nek6rk,,wallstreetbets,"Hi all, going to keep this short as there is already some great DD on Myovant Sciences out there on Reddit and some recent articles, plus I‚Äôm not a financial advisor.

The EMA (EU medical agency like FDA) announced Myovant and Relugolix as up for review to be accepted for Marketing approval in the EU this week. This is a huge catalyst in the biotech industry, and due to their Pfizer partnership this could result in a 50m cash payment to Myovant as well.

They also have an FDA PDUFA deadline of June 1 for a second application (their first of three was approved in December). If approved this would result in a 100m cash payment from Pfizer.

Alone, these are major catalysts. Right now they stand to go back to back on these catalysts. The last time the company had one catalyst like this, **they were rocketed past $30 a share and gained a strategic partnership from Pfizer.**

Now those are two major catalysts within two weeks, **if FDA decides early, both could happen this week.**

Due to the triple threat data put up in clinical trials and the fact that they had this data peer reviewed and published in the New England journal of medicine, there is strong confidence of approval on the company‚Äôs end.

Last but not least, they have additional catalysts still inbound after. Including Part D and Medicare coverage expected by July 1. All encompassed with a possible buyout from sumitomo.

If you're looking for a good article that covers the basics, you can search the below. Theres also some great posts on reddit and stock twits. I am also happy to answer any questions.

*Why The Misunderstood Pfizer Deal Makes Myovant A Great Low-Risk Investment*

**Quick list of upcoming catalysts:**

THIS WEEK: EMA meets to possibly approve sale of orgovyx in Europe

By June 1: Deadline for FDA approval for a second use case (this could come early and will result in another 100m cash payment from Pfizer)

By July 1: Part d and Medicare coverage: also supposed to be obtained before July 1 for prostate cancer application

Pfizer optionality: Pfizer can opt in to have the rights to sell this in some markets, resulting in a 50m cash payment and royalties paid to myovant. Submission of relugolix for the treatment of endometriosis to the FDA

Catalysts that could happen at any time:  **BUYOUT** from Sumitomo ( aka Sumitovant) or other interested partner (See Urovant history. Sumi has a patent cliff in 2023 they are trying to patch with acquisitions, has purchased 4 of movants sister companies and already owns 53.5% of myovant).

Strategic acquisition of new drug candidates to further myovants pipeline.

It sounds like an impossibility, but there are simple ways to reading a price chart that enable you to come very close to predicting the direction and turning points of a stock. One of the most important ways is through the identification and marking of channel line patterns.

&#x200B;

[ Prices respect the channel lines ](https://preview.redd.it/fqzpk486qpz61.png?width=1067&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5b02809e77b0f9d4f8162cd558a98154a5aad8e)

Channels lines are one of the most important patterns found on a price chart. They enable you to find the broader trend, or overall direction prices are heading, which is crucial towards choosing the direction of your trade. Sticking with the trend - going long on an uptrend and short on a downtrend - aligns you with the higher probability direction, already setting yourself up for a probable trade.

They also enable you to anticipate and profit from areas where the price has a high likelihood of reversing through a ""bounce"" - where prices hit an upper or lower side of the channel and bounce off of the level like a ball, and heading into the opposite direction. These are key areas because unlike a random point in the chart, a channel line presents a point that has a higher probability of doing one thing over another - *this is an example of where ""edge"" comes from - finding scenarios where one outcome is more likely than the other, and betting on it.*

&#x200B;

[ Channel line pattern with bounces circled ](https://preview.redd.it/f0l668a7qpz61.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=658f753348044acec2cceeaa1dfbf4c6288ae0ff)

## How do you define a channel pattern?

A channel line pattern exists when prices are moving between two parallel trendlines. A trendline is a straight line drawn to connect several major turning points, or swings, in the price chart. When there are two identifiable trendlines that are parallel to each other forming a straight band, prices are *trading within a channel*.

&#x200B;

[ A trendline drawn off of the highs ](https://preview.redd.it/fcfpptc8qpz61.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc81911e78d6e9ee5012760fc53e05f6200513b2)

Trendlines and channels are drawings that highlight the foundational concept of understanding price charts - support and resistance. Support is a level that lies underneath the current price that historically has acted as a cushion for prices, slowing their momentum or causing them to turn right around. Resistance is a level that lies above the current price that historically has acted as a barrier for prices, slowing their momentum or causing a reversal. In this way, support and resistance are one and the same - they are levels that ""support"" or ""resist"", keeping prices within their confines until they lose their power.

&#x200B;

>Prices will often ""test"" support and resistance multiple times and the level will successfully hold, creating areas with a high probability of a bounce - therefore creating trading opportunities.

## How to Draw Channel Lines

So, trendlines connect two or more support or resistance zones, which are areas where prices reversed or showed slowing momentum. Channels are two parallel trendlines. With that, *how can you draw a channel line on a price chart*?

The first consideration is if there is a channel at all. Often, there are ample opportunities to draw trendlines - straight lines connecting s/r. However, it is less often that the chart shows another parallel trendline that price has interacted with. Thus, a textbook ""channel"" with prices neatly filling in the space and bouncing off of the lines is not as easy as it seems to find - **this actually makes the pattern more important, as the discovery of a true channel pattern can lead to very clean bounces and high probability, low risk trades.**

To draw a channel, first find a trendline. Connect important swing lows or highs, and try to find a way to draw a line that connects two or more of the swings, while keeping all of of the other price movement between the swings above the line.

&#x200B;

[ First trendline duplicated and dragged to mark swing lows ](https://preview.redd.it/ss3uggaaqpz61.png?width=561&format=png&auto=webp&s=56e6198235392485a05edaddc3f8d0da4d802d4c)

>A trendline is only as significant as the prices' respect for it - there is no validity to drawing a trendline that connects two swings, while is broken by three other spikes.

Once you've found the trendline, either duplicate the trendline you have just drawn, or if using a channel drawing tool, simply drag the parallel line to see if it can connect two more swings on the opposite side of the price movement.

It takes *a lot* of practice to begin to properly draw channel lines that are valid and are respected by prices. Drawing channel patterns that match historical price charts is hard - and drawing them in a way that can successfully anticipate *future* price movements is even more of a learned skill. This can only be improved by practicing drawing channels on many different charts.

## Types of Channel Lines

The direction of channel lines determine the type of channel pattern. A channel pointed at an upward sloping angle signals an uptrend. A channel pointed at a downward angle signals a downtrend. A channel with a horizontal slope signals a range.

&#x200B;

[ Uptrend ](https://preview.redd.it/s8h4o1xbqpz61.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=1df032e442d4dddf112e30748baedcff16656291)

A concept that is helpful in the identification of a channel's direction is the presence of swing highs and lows. If prices are making higher swings high (peaks) and higher swings low (troughs), chances are they are in an uptrend. If prices are making lower highs and lower lows, they are likely in a downtrend. If there are equal or mismatching swing lows and highs, and prices look more horizontal, a range is likely in play.

&#x200B;

[ Downtrend with channel break ](https://preview.redd.it/wovf3mvcqpz61.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0029bb3d64ea2cb1da1b122a2e477cd0ce827d)

In a trending market, sticking with the direction of the trend can put you on the higher probability side. Combined with an entry identified by the channel lines, this can form the basis of a trading strategy.

In a ranging market, where prices are simply bouncing between two horizontal support and resistance trendlines, any time prices approach or touch the channel lines can be a significant reversal area, where there is a higher probability of a bounce than a breakout through the line.

&#x200B;

[Range](https://preview.redd.it/6z1kj65eqpz61.png?width=1019&format=png&auto=webp&s=3196922b3ddd01cd806ca9f100aa01918bf0b766)

## The Midline and Channel Pattern Breaks

Many channel drawing tools can display a midline, or a line 50% away from both trendlines. This line can serve as an important secondary trendline or support/resistance zone, and often prices react to the midline in a less apparent, but still significant way. Additionally, sometimes prices will break the channel line and form a new high outside of the channel. When this happens, the broken trendline can sometimes become the midline of a wider channel that incorporates the new swing.

&#x200B;

[ Upper channel line turned into midline after breakout ](https://preview.redd.it/wz5gw1peqpz61.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=68d55d124e5799ccc86ac01d5f860786ef24d183)

*When prices break a channel line, it is a sign that the pattern is losing validity.* The trend may be losing steam or accelerating, based on if it breaks the lower or the upper line. A channel line pattern is most valid when there are no price breaks of the trendlines. When prices break the countertrend side (the lower line in an uptrend or the upper line in a downtrend), you can anticipate a reversal soon. When prices break the with-trend side, the trend has accelerated, and you may need to redraw your channel line. This can also be seen as an expenditure of momentum which can bring a trend channel back into a range or a reversal.

## How to Trade With Channel Lines

Because channel line patterns offer areas that have *a higher probability of moving in one direction over the other*, trading strategies can be formed around the pattern. After identifying a valid channel, a strategy may look to buy or sell as price touches the with-trend channel line, setting a stop loss level based on volatility, Fibonacci extensions, or a selection of indicators that can identify momentum and turning points. A take profit level could be determined by a significant support/resistance level, Fibonacci retracements, or indicators similar to those used in stop placement.

&#x200B;

[ A channel bounce trade with \>2:1 risk:reward ](https://preview.redd.it/f24xyxqfqpz61.png?width=1521&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae05a98cdfdfcfb19552fbff3bbb2b5b4331ba7a)

The key advantage to trading channel bounces is the **high risk to reward** offered. A tight stop loss can allow for a high R:R ratio even with a high probability, modest profit target level. Thus, the strategy utilizes *a high probability turning point, a tight stop loss, and a modest profit target* which culminates into a trading plan with a healthy win rate and risk to reward ratio.

Finally, an overlooked aspect of using channels:

&#x200B;

>Channel line patterns have one final key importance to trading - they let you know when to not be in. This helps to reinforce a golden rule of trading - only look to enter trades when there is a higher probability of one thing happening over the other. By watching your channel lines, you'll know when it's there.

&#x200B;

[ Channels force you to be patient and wait for the turning points ](https://preview.redd.it/d3asavogqpz61.png?width=1063&format=png&auto=webp&s=42024fd0d87b9df76edf37e8c33df58b4675684c)

4331,,2021-05-17 17:38:52,t3_nemlpe,,wallstreetbets,"So right now, the mainstream narrative is that inflation is going to run red hot mostly due to a rally in commodity prices. This inflation has the potential to be more than transitory, meaning it lasts more than a couple of quarters at most and will result in forcing the FED to raise rates and crash growth stocks. This is why tech stocks are underperforming while value, or more specifically, manufacturing and mining companies outperform (look at XME for example).

My question is if that is the case, then why are steel futures for U.S. Midwest Domestic Hot-Rolled Coil Steel going down [CME Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/ferrous/hrc-steel_quotes_globex.html)? Right now they peak in June at $1,520 a tonne before steadily going down for the foreseeable future.

Similar things can be said about other commodities such as copper, which remains relatively steady before gradually going down going into next year [Copper Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/base/copper_quotes_globex.html).

On the agriculture side, major commodities like corn appear to be peaking in the near future as well [Corn Futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/grain-and-oilseed/corn_quotes_globex.html).

So taking all of this into account, it would appear that the shape of the futures curves would indicate that commodity prices would peak in near future before gradually going down as supply meets demand. Shouldn't this mean that inflation is indeed transitory as the FED predicts? What am I missing here?

**Tl;Dr:** Futures are showing commodity prices going down in the near future which should drag down inflation rates. Are inflation fears misplaced?",nemlpe,Are Commodity Futures Going Against The Mainstream Inflation Narrative?

It's no secret that companies hire teams of people to brainstorm, draft, and send tweets, but even with the millions of dollars spent on this process it is rare for corporate twitter accounts to have big spikes in followers. Wendy's can obviously tweet some witty stuff that will get lots of likes and retweets, but this usually doesn't motivate most people to sign up for extra ads on their timeline by actually following these accounts.

Wingstop, however, cracked the code on Wednesday by denying the presence of ejaculate in their special white sauce. On Wednesday, one customer tweeted ""wingstop ranch gotta have nut in it no way it‚Äôs just that good"" to which Wingstop replied ""it's a special white sauce but it does not contain \[nut\]""

The rest of the conversation did not contain any more trade secrets on the Wingstop recipe, but it was notable in its own way.

[Twitter screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/2rmwspravqz61.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=090ca925fe321799a1934ea2edfc746480922449)

I rarely ever see companies with hundreds of thousands of followers (Wingstop has over 200k) receive over a 5% increase in Twitter followers over a week. Wingstop had a 10% gain in a matter of days.

The market seemingly reacted with disappointment to the lack of bodily fluids in the secret recipe as $WING fell 2% in the day following the exchange.",nerobc,"Wingstop ($WING) has 11% growth in Twitter followers, 3% drop in stock price after denying that their special white sauce contains human ejaculate"

4359,,2021-05-17 21:46:48,t3_nesw0u,,wallstreetbets,"Hey Guys, it's me again. I think you guys may remember me, after all I wrote an extensive series of DD over a month on UWMC through its trials and tribulations, in anticipation of it's breakout moment. You might even remember my YOLO, and remembered I continuously added to it. And that I eventually upped my margin to 13.5k on it. Well, I'm here to tell you that I'm not out. I bought more calls to average down, on earnings day, and I held them when they tanked to ten cents a pop. My only regret is that I didn't buy more then. Though I threw a bit more cash into shares!

Back then, I said the Theta Beta's would regret selling those calls, and it was one of the few plays where there wouldn't be IV Crush. I was right. Their probably a little sour. Sorry chaps, you usually are the one's making money at our expense. This time it's going to have to be the other way around....

Today, I had the chance to exit my options for a 47% profit roughly. Sell calls for a chunky profit after that. I said no. You know why? Because fuck the people who shorted an extremely profitable company to 6.26 dollars, that's why. The Fear, the Uncertainty, and the Doubt people expressed to me regarding this company espoused to me because of the actions of those people gave me an aneurysm. So fuck them. We're playing Pac Man people. The CEO of UWMC is reducing the float, and increasing the percentage of the float that is sold short while increasing buying pressure. We're buying up the stock to get the price to 9-10 because people bought options for 5-10 cents and they'll be in the money quite easily. And because of the rising volume, every day the CEO is able to buy more and more shares thanks to Rule 10B. The delta on the options is low, and they will need to hedge as the price heads steadily upward on Friday. Then the Shorts are going to be squeezed even further as the market makers hedge.

So no, I won't sell my options for a 10 or a 50% profit. I'm going to sell my options at a price I damn well want to. One that compensates me for the trouble that these people have given me. And so should you.

I understand people have taken profits, but honestly, at the price point they were selling at the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. Good for them though. Next time, could you at least sell deep ITM covered calls though lmao.

And for those people on the fucking fence. You jumped onto MVIS, you jumped into GME, and AMC, and all manners of companies that are either unprofitable or make very little money. But the fucking BOOMER stock is where you hesitate the fence?! The fucking (Eyy Lmaooo) Boomer stock, giving you a 4.87% dividend? The one that, if you somehow baghold can give you 10-15% cash returns through divitendies and covered calls until you get assigned at a strike that is profitable to you? The 10-15% backboard cash that can fund all your yolo's? That's the fucking stock you hesitate on? El LMAO. The companies margins will expand hard in a few months, and it's still hugely profitable at a less than 1 percent margin so yeah. Now if you were buying at 14 fucking bucks, you're a dumb ape, but yeah.

I'm fucking going to ride my options to a fucking profit margin that compensates me for the shit they pulled, or to a GUH. No in between. The Stock Buyback middle finger is just the fucking sweetener.

Matt Daddy, and I, and all the people who everyone called bag holders are going to skull fuck the shorters harder than they skull fucked UWMC's share price. They're going to fucking Guh their way into a fucking shoebox. Fuck em. I want me tendies well cooked, a side of fries, and a foot massage. And their going to give it to me. And to all of you who bought, and are buying UWMC.

4368,,2021-05-18 01:34:15,t3_nexq9s,,wallstreetbets,"I don't normally play meme stocks - but I thought the GME technical setup was especially intriguing recently.

[GME TA](https://preview.redd.it/1tmj448o6sz61.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=1de6593bb253ff2a102250d3e4a97d521e0b3455)

The setup is a symmetrical triangle. Normally when continuation patterns come from downside - they have a bearish bias. However - we broke that red trendline  with an uptick in volume - this was a hint we were ready for an actual reversal. That trendline kept us in a downtrend for about 4 months. Not only that but...

**TODAY WE BROKE THE SYMMETRICAL TRIANGLE UP - WHICH MEANS ITS FULL SPEED AHEAD!**

Confluence between technicals generate the best signals.

This is the best the setup has looked since GME was at 10. Price target for this is 231.52 resistance initially, followed by 348.50. Breakout is invalid and play is dead if we get a daily close back under 158.11.

And... that's it.

I've been trading for a long time and only use patterns, trendlines & volume. Keep it simple. You don't need to waste 100 hours doing 15 paragraphs of DD for one swing trade - or look at 100 different indicators cherry picking the ones that say your position will go up.

***TL;DR*** \- GME actually looks good for once from an **unbiased** technical standpoint

***EDIT:*** Clarification - I wasn't speaking for GME as a whole when I said it was dead under 158.11 - I simply meant this setup in particular was no longer valid. It could always form a new one. I chose that level because it's the most significant one below the breakout point.",nexq9s,$GME TA - BIG BREAKOUT TODAY - SETUP LOOKS BETTER THAN IT EVER HAS

$CNK is AMCs largest competitor and is in the great business we know as movie theaters. When AMC last went crazy, CNK ran up over 56% in a few days from 22-27 of January to $27+. In the past month, AMC is up over 50%. CNK is roughly even. It is lagging behind and is due for a major pop on this AMC craze. It is a classically more boring stock that takes a big nudge to move.

Breaking out similar to AMC. Insanely strong volume shelf in low 20s (high demand) and above 1D 21MA. RSI has lots of room to run. 

**MARGIN**

CNK has a much lower implied volatility and actually allows for margin borrowing. This could be attractive depending on your risk appetite

**DILUTION/FINANCIALS**

CNK has almost no share dilution since the pandemic started, and it has been historically stronger than AMC from a traditional (retarded) financial perspective. AMCs market value growth has passed CNKs by many multiples over the past year. No reason she can't get some love.

I‚Äôm sure he got in a while ago and is already up a bunch of money, but I feel like there are still gains to be made in this trade in the months ahead.

The reason I‚Äôm posting is that $TLT has already come down a fair amount in the past month, but this still seems like an easy money play on inflation.

Glacier Capital exists. That sentence isn't going to make me any friends, but your wallet needs to hear it. They've even written some insightful pieces which panned out as per the analyses; CVNA (link below) performed well in the short-term as predicted, but the majority shareholder and CEO sold practically all of his shares four days ago, al in line with their poor long-term outlook.

[http://glaciercapital.lu/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/This-Time-is-not-Different-LP-August-2019.pdf](http://glaciercapital.lu/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/This-Time-is-not-Different-LP-August-2019.pdf)

A lot of the theorising focuses on the founding year of the company. Look... the profile on Bloomberg is for a different Glacier Capital LLC. There appear to be quite a few Glacier Capital LLCs. In the US, LLC names are not unique on a federal level. Unrelated companies in different states can have exactly the same name.

When we consider that the CEO of *the* Glacier Capital was still a university student in 2005, we can safely conclude this isn't a smoking gun and it's likely we're tripping up over unrelated companies.

Look at the dates. When the whole GME surge was first kicking off, Glacier Capital filed to register for a 'Legal Entity Identifier' (LEI) in order to comply with 'Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II' (MiFID II), which was a tightening of regulations within the EU in 2008. LEIs are required in order to comply with MiFID II, and MiFID II needs to be complied with in order to carry out certain high risk activities, including forms/scales of derivatives.

I am not a European financial services lawyer but considering the timing of everything, it seems reasonable to assume that the short positions may be real - and if new certs were put in place just for one series of positions, then it isn't crazy to think they might be especially large.

Again, *I am not saying* that this isn't an incestuous industry or that the capital isn't coming from known players. I am specifically begging you not to be a fucking dumbfuck because of one Reddit-cum-Sherlock post so that whatever dumbass decision you make next is at least a little less erratic. I've been holding since January, I'm not telling you not to buy GME, this is not FUD. Just don't be allergic to facts. Know your risks.",nf5m0v,"""Glacier Capital"" DOES exist.

If you read those footnotes, you can see that some judges on the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (which is 7 very qualified federal judges) have recused themselves and others have had to renounce their claims (normal for judges) against the defendants to even participate, as they would have been members of the several putative actions.

1.**The Fed will cap yields and do whatever it takes to support the economy and markets‚Äîi.e., much more dollar printing.**

**Let me dig in !**

The recent NFIB survey suggests we are only in an economic recovery, not an expansion.

NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

üì∑

Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *‚Äúactually‚Äù* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *‚Äúdemand‚Äù* meets its operating cash flows.

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ew6w5tu19vz61.png?width=804&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bba4677ec15d513e78d6d19644722b133068a48

Businesses understand that the stimulus [***‚Äúpulled forward‚Äù***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)

much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***‚Äúcosts‚Äù*** **of** ***‚Äúlong-term employment‚Äù*** **for a** ***‚Äúshort-term‚Äù*** **artificial economic boost.**

The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.**¬†Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0bcfon349vz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=89b498f76db582407f08e593e10dc5692e6005f2

 

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive. Therefore **Fed will cap yields and do whatever it takes to support the economy , employment and markets.**

At the risk of repeating myself, the risk to the upside in the 30-Year yield is capped somewhere between 2.75-3.00%,

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w1cuikh69vz61.png?width=836&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b01f66a5badd3fc80e79abecd97096e309324a5

 

2. **Inflation will rise dramatically, and the risk is that it‚Äôll be worse than expected:**

We finally got ‚Äúofficial‚Äù confirmation in May that inflation has already begun to take off:

The headline CPI year-over-year increase at 4.2% was the highest since 2008. Energy prices rose 25% and gas prices 50%. Rising energy prices filter through to almost everything. Used car and truck prices were up 21%. Rents rose 2.1%. If you substitute home prices for rents, that number more than doubled.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1qccmij89vz61.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7c72ce894c8a9cddbf6a739715174d69d093229

 On top of all that, the CPI is widely understood to dramatically understate inflation, so the increases are much worse than the headline numbers. As I like to say, one just has to look at the performance of commodity futures over the past year, or go to Home Depot or the grocery store. It‚Äôs not rocket science. This will continue until the monetary and fiscal stimulus stops, small and medium-sized businesses return, and employment rises significantly. Don‚Äôt hold your breath, 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fjw00bba9vz61.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=a09d8f5b80ba4ea16d4fe02b812aa64a15ff8c3c

 

The month-over-month increases were far higher than expected, double in the case of the headline PPI. These are the prices that filter through to consumer prices over time‚Äîi.e., the CPI is likely going even higher.¬†

If that were not enough, wage inflation is on the rise, too, as employers struggle to get people off the couch who can otherwise live on their stimulus checks. Checks that are unlikely to be inflation indexed. Several States have already begun or are considering a ‚Äúreturn to work bonus‚Äù in order to get people to go back to work.

""Therefore I assume inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside .""

Conclusion and Goals :

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

The scenario to play out in weeks in precious Metals ;

 

Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and Gold and the metals soar.Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields.I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks.

Gold & silver's monthly defined 2021 road map still intact. Q2 and Q4 belong to silver, while gold will shine in Q3. For Silver q2 /2021 my targets are 42 Usd /ozz while gold 1.900 Usd/ozz .

We also need to take into consideration that the Biden Administration is currently running wide open trying to pass another 1.9T money printing scam.

The new child tax credit payments are getting ready to start going out making it even harder to get people off their asses to go back to work. This administration is also running wide open trying to pass ridiculous tax hikes on businesses which will increase unemployment, prevent expansion, and incentivize companies to move out of the country.

very basic finance accounting & valuation. something like damodaran.

some passive investing like John boggle.

Peter Lynch because very basic, open minded and doing everything.

some cyclical investors.

some longterm thinkers like buffet or munger etc. Philip fisher ! nomad letters ! Thomas William phelps !

pat Dorsey. Michael malboussini! 

outsiders is a good book. I like mc Kinsey valuation as well. 

the most important thing I guess is to gasp the basics of every method, and distil the essentials. at the end of the day it boils down to ROIC, durability of those margins that make the roic, and opportunities to deploy capital at that roic, and the valuation you pay for that roic as an investor.

Step 1 for me is zooming out. Despite the current market WELL actually held up quite strong - Beautiful Weekly close wicked just above the 20day SMA forming a nice support (Double bottom) in this 6.20 -8.20 channel. If we can snap this losing streak I think that might be our immediate next stop.

If we can open above 6.9 (50day SMA) I think we can close around that 7.14 (200day SMA) level which should line us up for that move out of the $6-$8 range and into the $10s and beyond.

Now funny enough what actually has me the most bullish this morning is looking at Friday alone. Selling pressure was suppressed by the bulls and it closed right near HOD above all major resistances.

UWMC is ready to pop!

I was in UWMC for the value play. It is a STEAL at 10$ on fundamentals anything below that is an insane deal. Even above 10 has a strong long-term argument.

Here is UWMC in a nutshell: heavily shorted, borrow costs skyrocketing, mortgage industry hit overly hard on fears of rising interest rates, the CEO Ishiba announces a 300M stock buyback, and shorts are QUAKING. UP 6% in premarket following being up 1-2% Friday. This puts at starting at $8 Monday with $9 being a CRITICAL Friday target for us.

All UWMC needs is a little unexpected retail buying pressure and it POPS! In truth this is not just a short squeeze, its multiple plays rolled into one. We have retail buying hype train going (obviously, look at all the WSB posts here posted below), short-squeeze due to high cost of borrow, Gamma squeeze due to the MASSIVE options interest, 300M stock buyback by CEO to scare off the shorts, an unfair post-earnings plunge, plus good-ole\` company doing good things (making money).

We coming back for some of our loyal bagholders that have been holding UWMC since the last train to $14, hey guys remember to take profit this time ;)

It is now cost-prohibitive to use more shorts to keep the price low. The normal dirty tricks triple in price so become less-used. Shorts use this borrow price to determine feasibility and 93% is obviously unfeasible, THEY WILL COVER. Once one group starts covering and causes a spike, other shorts will rush to do the same.

It's a prisoner's dilemma and HF's want to cut each other's throats just as much as ours. Let's let them!!!

Many of these 7.50,9. 10, and 12 are OTM or barely ITM. and an early week spike to put 9c ITM would force MM's to hedge to delta-neutral...further pushing 10c and 12.50 c into hedge territory. This can quickly cause things to spiral out of control for shorts.

Stock BuyBack,

Ishbia is going to war with the shorts and his weapon of choice is a 300M stock buyback (similar to RKT's special dividend for the same purpose). The buyback could have started happening as early as May 11th.

Most of the float is owned by institutions and insiders so this buyback puts increased pressure of a heavily shorted (13%+) and heavily held float pool.

Retail is gorging on the float, institutions are holding the float, and Ishbia is buying the free float up. This is a recipe for ROCKET FUEL. WIth shorts paying 93%, they will stop shorting so the shares we are buying are REAL, not synthetic.

Make them buy real shares, from us, at 20$ each.

I am in UWMC for the long-term VALUE-PLAY and like the stock. I like the company., I like the CEO. I like the market position. I like the value. I ilke the stock.

I am loading up on 6/18 8c options. Options are important as we move up to force MM's to buy to remain market neutral.

Options do not pay unless we buy shares, so I suggest splitting half/half to each. options can cause MM's to balance risk and lead to large upswings but this cannot happen without buying pressure and the underlying spiking to necessitate balancing risk, which means we need to buy stocks as well.

Options are good for Gamma Squeeze/MM's balance buys (and profit) but shares are needed to keep the underlying JOOSED and keep those options deep ITM.

MIX IT UP!

This is the final call for the UWMC tendie train so get your fucking tickets and remember; Gravy costs extra,

4827,,2021-05-17 13:20:55,t3_neg3ey,,wallstreetbets,"$UWMC has become one of the most hyped stocks in the online investment community. Online activity appears to be ramping up after earnings and heading into May 21st option expiries. Since UWM is getting a lot of new eyes, it seemed like an appropriate time to share why some investors may consider UWM as a long term hold. 

UWM is a mortgage company that focuses exclusively on the broker channel. It‚Äôs the largest wholesale mortgage provider in the US and the second largest mortgage originator, behind Rocket Companies. 

It‚Äôs CEO is Mat Ishbia, who started as it‚Äôs 12th employee and who‚Äôs dad, Jeff, started the company as a side hustle. Mat and his brother own 94% of the company in Class D shares. The rest of the public float, \~100m Class A shares, are what is available for the public to purchase. 

# What trends are pushing $UWMC‚Äôs stock down? 

**The largest threat UWM is facing is raising interest rates**: 

About 75% of UWM income is related to refinance activity. The pandemic pushed rates to historic lows so most consumers were better off refinancing. Millions have done that, leading to record profit for mortgage providers like UWM and Rocket. 

**The strength of the broker channel:**

UWM is completely dependent on brokers finding business and closing loans. It doesn‚Äôt have any direct-to-consumer lending operations like Rocket does. 

**Short Interest:** 

Sophisticated investors are seeing 75% of income potentially attached to rate sensitive products (not all refi‚Äôs are rate sensitive like cash out), and are salivating. They think the market is under appreciating this headwind and shorting the stock. They have basically shorted all the shares they can. Friday the stock ended with 200 shares available and an insane 93% borrow rate. 

**SPAC:**

It is true that the SPAC market has softened recently. It is very reasonable to assume $UWMC is a part of that softening. It may not attract institutional investors because of the SPAC situation and the short period it has been publicly traded. Lots of other nice places to put institutional money.

**Competitors:** Mortgages are a mature market and competition is fierce. Rocket, LoanDepot and UWM mentioned a pricing war in their earnings. (LD statement). This will compress loan sale margins in the short term. 

**What trends are pushing $UWMC stock up?** 

**Short term retail pressure:**

there is a lot of retail attention on the potential short squeeze/gamma squeeze you could see this week in UWMC. My post is about UWM‚Äôs long term perspective, so I‚Äôll let [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ndcm0p/uwmc_is_a_powderkeg_low_float_high_short_huge/) take you further down that rabbit hole. Additionally, smart money is now tracking online sentiment, which can lead to increased institutional purchases. 

**Broker Channel Growth:** Mat has claimed two reasons for taking UWM public. He wanted access to the liquidity market and marketing exposure for the broker channel. For UWM to become the largest mortgage originator, Mat has targeted ‚Öì mortgages to be originated by brokers and UWM to own 50% of that channel by 2025/26. Currently UWM owns 36% of the broker channel with brokers originating 20% of all mortgages. Before the housing crisis in 2008, brokers were 58% of mortgage originations (Per Mat & Q1 2021 Earnings call), so it isn‚Äôt crazy to think they could get back to ‚Öì as it is growing: [https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum](https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum)

I had a loan with Rocket and tried to refinance with them. I then went through a mortgage broker and got the same loan for $4.5k cheaper in closing costs. This is because Rocket‚Äôs retail channel has 4% margins and it‚Äôs partnership network (includes wholesale, realtors, etc.) has 1% margins. 

**New Product Offerings:** 

UWM recently released new products like their jumbo loan. In earnings, Mat said he expects $2b in volume from Jumbo. They also added ARM‚Äôs, manufactured homes and expanded government programs. 

**Wholesale mortgage provider consolidation:** 

Mat said 3 of the top 25 wholesale lenders have been purchased in the last 90 days. This type of consolidation happens in mature markets by companies that are reaching for market share. THis could be a sign companies are under pressure to grow but cannot organically get market share from UWM. 

**UWM ‚ÄúAll In‚Äù Ultimatum:** 

Rocket and Fairway are priortizing other channels (cause the margins are so much higher) and trying to squeeze out brokers. UWM said if you work with those two, don‚Äôt work for us. The goal was to stand up for the broker channel WHILE putting some pressure on Rocket and Fairway‚Äôs partnership channel. This may have kickstarted the pricing war. 

**Aggressive Capital returns:** 

UWM pays an annual .40 dividend on its class A shares. That only costs them \~$42m/year. Remember their Q1 net income was $800m+. So their dividends hardly affect the balance sheet. The board just approved a $300/million share buyback as well that will reduce share count. Mat knows a thing or two about shorting stocks. He just sold at $10 and has authority to buy back with the current price under $8. The man successfully shorted his own company. What a legend. 

**Long Term Prediction:** 

I‚Äôm invested in UWM because I believe the capital returns will be aggressive during the upswing and the company will remain profitable in a downturn. With a 5%+ dividend return, share buyback, and \*potentially\* growing market share, UWM could be primed to overtake Rocket within the next few years.

4831,,2021-05-17 14:45:52,t3_nei5qk,,wallstreetbets,"As the cloud & big data continues to grow, as well as social media & 4k/8k video, data storage is becoming more important than ever.

Large social media sites take in a tremendous amount of data each day. This storage must not only be stored, but stored with redundancy as well as backups. Major sites such as Facebook and YouTube keep content that is over a decade old. Over time, the drives holding this content will fail and need to be replaced, leading to growing recurring demand as the size of the platform grows.

The need for storage has been growing for decades, but innovation in storage density and intense competition has limited profitability in the market in the past. That being said, there is reason to believe that the growth in storage density may stop keeping up with the growth in storage needs.

There is also reason to believe that transient growth in storage demand may drive higher Q2 earnings. A new digital currency, Chia, has gobbled up about 6 Exabytes worth of storage in the past 3 weeks, now growing at a rate of about 0.4 EiB per day(and rising). https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/netspace

For reference, about 288 Exabytes worth of hard drives were shipped in Q1 2021 https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hdd-shipments-in-q1-2021

Chia network size can be considered a lagging indicator for unexpected drive shipments. Generally, it can take a few weeks between when a drive is purchased and when it's actually accounted for on the network, as it takes time for it to be shipped, set up, and plotted. Chia wasn't even listed on exchanges until a couple weeks ago, so most of the growth seen is prior to Chia even having a price. At current prices, mining is incredibly profitable, with a $500 14 TB drive estimated to produce about $26 per day, and using very little power. So even if the network grows 10x to 60 Exabytes, it's still producing $3/day at current prices. So expect the surge in demand to continue.

I have seen many anecdotes of drive shortages over the past couple weeks. Reviewing sites like Amazon, I have also seen high capacity drives go out of stock or require lead times of a few weeks.

This may be a bit reminiscent of GPU shortages among Nvidia and AMD as miners seek to buy up anything they can.

If we project continued growth at 0.4 Exabytes a day in unexpected demand from proof of storage over the next 40 days, plus the 6 Exabytes added since April 20(leaving out first 3 weeks in quarter as they were likely logged last quarter), that's about 22 Exabytes to be added in Q2 that are not part of normal usage, or about an extra ~8% of Q1 demand.

What's perhaps most interesting is the impact this could have on margins. Unlike the GPUs used to mine which are consumer devices, the devices used for mining Chia includes enterprise grade hardware. Prices in the drive market are more flexible at the manufacturer level, and currently have much lower margins. If proof of storage currencies cause a drive shortage, it could have a significant impact on margins. Western digital sells about 40% of its drives through distributors, Seagate about 30%. Sales through these channels generally are very responsive to demand trends in terms of prices.

Seagate is also in a position to profit from this, but I'm a bit more worried about them as hard drive shipments have been on a long term decline and they aren't diversified into SSDs/flash like Western Digital is.

4836,,2021-05-17 16:06:02,t3_nek6rk,,wallstreetbets,"Hi all, going to keep this short as there is already some great DD on Myovant Sciences out there on Reddit and some recent articles, plus I‚Äôm not a financial advisor.

The EMA (EU medical agency like FDA) announced Myovant and Relugolix as up for review to be accepted for Marketing approval in the EU this week. This is a huge catalyst in the biotech industry, and due to their Pfizer partnership this could result in a 50m cash payment to Myovant as well.

They also have an FDA PDUFA deadline of June 1 for a second application (their first of three was approved in December). If approved this would result in a 100m cash payment from Pfizer.

Alone, these are major catalysts. Right now they stand to go back to back on these catalysts. The last time the company had one catalyst like this, **they were rocketed past $30 a share and gained a strategic partnership from Pfizer.**

Now those are two major catalysts within two weeks, **if FDA decides early, both could happen this week.**

Due to the triple threat data put up in clinical trials and the fact that they had this data peer reviewed and published in the New England journal of medicine, there is strong confidence of approval on the company‚Äôs end.

Last but not least, they have additional catalysts still inbound after. Including Part D and Medicare coverage expected by July 1. All encompassed with a possible buyout from sumitomo.

If you're looking for a good article that covers the basics, you can search the below. Theres also some great posts on reddit and stock twits. I am also happy to answer any questions.

*Why The Misunderstood Pfizer Deal Makes Myovant A Great Low-Risk Investment*

**Quick list of upcoming catalysts:**

THIS WEEK: EMA meets to possibly approve sale of orgovyx in Europe

By June 1: Deadline for FDA approval for a second use case (this could come early and will result in another 100m cash payment from Pfizer)

By July 1: Part d and Medicare coverage: also supposed to be obtained before July 1 for prostate cancer application

It sounds like an impossibility, but there are simple ways to reading a price chart that enable you to come very close to predicting the direction and turning points of a stock. One of the most important ways is through the identification and marking of channel line patterns.

&#x200B;

[ Prices respect the channel lines ](https://preview.redd.it/fqzpk486qpz61.png?width=1067&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5b02809e77b0f9d4f8162cd558a98154a5aad8e)

Channels lines are one of the most important patterns found on a price chart. They enable you to find the broader trend, or overall direction prices are heading, which is crucial towards choosing the direction of your trade. Sticking with the trend - going long on an uptrend and short on a downtrend - aligns you with the higher probability direction, already setting yourself up for a probable trade.

They also enable you to anticipate and profit from areas where the price has a high likelihood of reversing through a ""bounce"" - where prices hit an upper or lower side of the channel and bounce off of the level like a ball, and heading into the opposite direction. These are key areas because unlike a random point in the chart, a channel line presents a point that has a higher probability of doing one thing over another - *this is an example of where ""edge"" comes from - finding scenarios where one outcome is more likely than the other, and betting on it.*

&#x200B;

[ Channel line pattern with bounces circled ](https://preview.redd.it/f0l668a7qpz61.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=658f753348044acec2cceeaa1dfbf4c6288ae0ff)

## How do you define a channel pattern?

A channel line pattern exists when prices are moving between two parallel trendlines. A trendline is a straight line drawn to connect several major turning points, or swings, in the price chart. When there are two identifiable trendlines that are parallel to each other forming a straight band, prices are *trading within a channel*.

&#x200B;

[ A trendline drawn off of the highs ](https://preview.redd.it/fcfpptc8qpz61.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc81911e78d6e9ee5012760fc53e05f6200513b2)

Trendlines and channels are drawings that highlight the foundational concept of understanding price charts - support and resistance. Support is a level that lies underneath the current price that historically has acted as a cushion for prices, slowing their momentum or causing them to turn right around. Resistance is a level that lies above the current price that historically has acted as a barrier for prices, slowing their momentum or causing a reversal. In this way, support and resistance are one and the same - they are levels that ""support"" or ""resist"", keeping prices within their confines until they lose their power.

&#x200B;

>Prices will often ""test"" support and resistance multiple times and the level will successfully hold, creating areas with a high probability of a bounce - therefore creating trading opportunities.

## How to Draw Channel Lines

So, trendlines connect two or more support or resistance zones, which are areas where prices reversed or showed slowing momentum. Channels are two parallel trendlines. With that, *how can you draw a channel line on a price chart*?

The first consideration is if there is a channel at all. Often, there are ample opportunities to draw trendlines - straight lines connecting s/r. However, it is less often that the chart shows another parallel trendline that price has interacted with. Thus, a textbook ""channel"" with prices neatly filling in the space and bouncing off of the lines is not as easy as it seems to find - **this actually makes the pattern more important, as the discovery of a true channel pattern can lead to very clean bounces and high probability, low risk trades.**

To draw a channel, first find a trendline. Connect important swing lows or highs, and try to find a way to draw a line that connects two or more of the swings, while keeping all of of the other price movement between the swings above the line.

&#x200B;

[ First trendline duplicated and dragged to mark swing lows ](https://preview.redd.it/ss3uggaaqpz61.png?width=561&format=png&auto=webp&s=56e6198235392485a05edaddc3f8d0da4d802d4c)

>A trendline is only as significant as the prices' respect for it - there is no validity to drawing a trendline that connects two swings, while is broken by three other spikes.

Once you've found the trendline, either duplicate the trendline you have just drawn, or if using a channel drawing tool, simply drag the parallel line to see if it can connect two more swings on the opposite side of the price movement.

It takes *a lot* of practice to begin to properly draw channel lines that are valid and are respected by prices. Drawing channel patterns that match historical price charts is hard - and drawing them in a way that can successfully anticipate *future* price movements is even more of a learned skill. This can only be improved by practicing drawing channels on many different charts.

## Types of Channel Lines

The direction of channel lines determine the type of channel pattern. A channel pointed at an upward sloping angle signals an uptrend. A channel pointed at a downward angle signals a downtrend. A channel with a horizontal slope signals a range.

&#x200B;

[ Uptrend ](https://preview.redd.it/s8h4o1xbqpz61.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=1df032e442d4dddf112e30748baedcff16656291)

A concept that is helpful in the identification of a channel's direction is the presence of swing highs and lows. If prices are making higher swings high (peaks) and higher swings low (troughs), chances are they are in an uptrend. If prices are making lower highs and lower lows, they are likely in a downtrend. If there are equal or mismatching swing lows and highs, and prices look more horizontal, a range is likely in play.

&#x200B;

[ Downtrend with channel break ](https://preview.redd.it/wovf3mvcqpz61.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0029bb3d64ea2cb1da1b122a2e477cd0ce827d)

In a trending market, sticking with the direction of the trend can put you on the higher probability side. Combined with an entry identified by the channel lines, this can form the basis of a trading strategy.

In a ranging market, where prices are simply bouncing between two horizontal support and resistance trendlines, any time prices approach or touch the channel lines can be a significant reversal area, where there is a higher probability of a bounce than a breakout through the line.

&#x200B;

[Range](https://preview.redd.it/6z1kj65eqpz61.png?width=1019&format=png&auto=webp&s=3196922b3ddd01cd806ca9f100aa01918bf0b766)

## The Midline and Channel Pattern Breaks

Many channel drawing tools can display a midline, or a line 50% away from both trendlines. This line can serve as an important secondary trendline or support/resistance zone, and often prices react to the midline in a less apparent, but still significant way. Additionally, sometimes prices will break the channel line and form a new high outside of the channel. When this happens, the broken trendline can sometimes become the midline of a wider channel that incorporates the new swing.

&#x200B;

[ Upper channel line turned into midline after breakout ](https://preview.redd.it/wz5gw1peqpz61.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=68d55d124e5799ccc86ac01d5f860786ef24d183)

*When prices break a channel line, it is a sign that the pattern is losing validity.* The trend may be losing steam or accelerating, based on if it breaks the lower or the upper line. A channel line pattern is most valid when there are no price breaks of the trendlines. When prices break the countertrend side (the lower line in an uptrend or the upper line in a downtrend), you can anticipate a reversal soon. When prices break the with-trend side, the trend has accelerated, and you may need to redraw your channel line. This can also be seen as an expenditure of momentum which can bring a trend channel back into a range or a reversal.

## How to Trade With Channel Lines

Because channel line patterns offer areas that have *a higher probability of moving in one direction over the other*, trading strategies can be formed around the pattern. After identifying a valid channel, a strategy may look to buy or sell as price touches the with-trend channel line, setting a stop loss level based on volatility, Fibonacci extensions, or a selection of indicators that can identify momentum and turning points. A take profit level could be determined by a significant support/resistance level, Fibonacci retracements, or indicators similar to those used in stop placement.

&#x200B;

[ A channel bounce trade with \>2:1 risk:reward ](https://preview.redd.it/f24xyxqfqpz61.png?width=1521&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae05a98cdfdfcfb19552fbff3bbb2b5b4331ba7a)

The key advantage to trading channel bounces is the **high risk to reward** offered. A tight stop loss can allow for a high R:R ratio even with a high probability, modest profit target level. Thus, the strategy utilizes *a high probability turning point, a tight stop loss, and a modest profit target* which culminates into a trading plan with a healthy win rate and risk to reward ratio.

Finally, an overlooked aspect of using channels:

&#x200B;

>Channel line patterns have one final key importance to trading - they let you know when to not be in. This helps to reinforce a golden rule of trading - only look to enter trades when there is a higher probability of one thing happening over the other. By watching your channel lines, you'll know when it's there.

&#x200B;

[ Channels force you to be patient and wait for the turning points ](https://preview.redd.it/d3asavogqpz61.png?width=1063&format=png&auto=webp&s=42024fd0d87b9df76edf37e8c33df58b4675684c)

4843,,2021-05-17 17:38:52,t3_nemlpe,,wallstreetbets,"So right now, the mainstream narrative is that inflation is going to run red hot mostly due to a rally in commodity prices. This inflation has the potential to be more than transitory, meaning it lasts more than a couple of quarters at most and will result in forcing the FED to raise rates and crash growth stocks. This is why tech stocks are underperforming while value, or more specifically, manufacturing and mining companies outperform (look at XME for example).

My question is if that is the case, then why are steel futures for U.S. Midwest Domestic Hot-Rolled Coil Steel going down [CME Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/ferrous/hrc-steel_quotes_globex.html)? Right now they peak in June at $1,520 a tonne before steadily going down for the foreseeable future.

Similar things can be said about other commodities such as copper, which remains relatively steady before gradually going down going into next year [Copper Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/base/copper_quotes_globex.html).

On the agriculture side, major commodities like corn appear to be peaking in the near future as well [Corn Futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/grain-and-oilseed/corn_quotes_globex.html).

So taking all of this into account, it would appear that the shape of the futures curves would indicate that commodity prices would peak in near future before gradually going down as supply meets demand. Shouldn't this mean that inflation is indeed transitory as the FED predicts? What am I missing here?

**Tl;Dr:** Futures are showing commodity prices going down in the near future which should drag down inflation rates. Are inflation fears misplaced?",nemlpe,Are Commodity Futures Going Against The Mainstream Inflation Narrative?

It's no secret that companies hire teams of people to brainstorm, draft, and send tweets, but even with the millions of dollars spent on this process it is rare for corporate twitter accounts to have big spikes in followers. Wendy's can obviously tweet some witty stuff that will get lots of likes and retweets, but this usually doesn't motivate most people to sign up for extra ads on their timeline by actually following these accounts.

Wingstop, however, cracked the code on Wednesday by denying the presence of ejaculate in their special white sauce. On Wednesday, one customer tweeted ""wingstop ranch gotta have nut in it no way it‚Äôs just that good"" to which Wingstop replied ""it's a special white sauce but it does not contain \[nut\]""

The rest of the conversation did not contain any more trade secrets on the Wingstop recipe, but it was notable in its own way.

[Twitter screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/2rmwspravqz61.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=090ca925fe321799a1934ea2edfc746480922449)

I rarely ever see companies with hundreds of thousands of followers (Wingstop has over 200k) receive over a 5% increase in Twitter followers over a week. Wingstop had a 10% gain in a matter of days.

The market seemingly reacted with disappointment to the lack of bodily fluids in the secret recipe as $WING fell 2% in the day following the exchange.",nerobc,"Wingstop ($WING) has 11% growth in Twitter followers, 3% drop in stock price after denying that their special white sauce contains human ejaculate"

4871,,2021-05-17 21:46:48,t3_nesw0u,,wallstreetbets,"Hey Guys, it's me again. I think you guys may remember me, after all I wrote an extensive series of DD over a month on UWMC through its trials and tribulations, in anticipation of it's breakout moment. You might even remember my YOLO, and remembered I continuously added to it. And that I eventually upped my margin to 13.5k on it. Well, I'm here to tell you that I'm not out. I bought more calls to average down, on earnings day, and I held them when they tanked to ten cents a pop. My only regret is that I didn't buy more then. Though I threw a bit more cash into shares!

Back then, I said the Theta Beta's would regret selling those calls, and it was one of the few plays where there wouldn't be IV Crush. I was right. Their probably a little sour. Sorry chaps, you usually are the one's making money at our expense. This time it's going to have to be the other way around....

Today, I had the chance to exit my options for a 47% profit roughly. Sell calls for a chunky profit after that. I said no. You know why? Because fuck the people who shorted an extremely profitable company to 6.26 dollars, that's why. The Fear, the Uncertainty, and the Doubt people expressed to me regarding this company espoused to me because of the actions of those people gave me an aneurysm. So fuck them. We're playing Pac Man people. The CEO of UWMC is reducing the float, and increasing the percentage of the float that is sold short while increasing buying pressure. We're buying up the stock to get the price to 9-10 because people bought options for 5-10 cents and they'll be in the money quite easily. And because of the rising volume, every day the CEO is able to buy more and more shares thanks to Rule 10B. The delta on the options is low, and they will need to hedge as the price heads steadily upward on Friday. Then the Shorts are going to be squeezed even further as the market makers hedge.

So no, I won't sell my options for a 10 or a 50% profit. I'm going to sell my options at a price I damn well want to. One that compensates me for the trouble that these people have given me. And so should you.

I understand people have taken profits, but honestly, at the price point they were selling at the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. Good for them though. Next time, could you at least sell deep ITM covered calls though lmao.

And for those people on the fucking fence. You jumped onto MVIS, you jumped into GME, and AMC, and all manners of companies that are either unprofitable or make very little money. But the fucking BOOMER stock is where you hesitate the fence?! The fucking (Eyy Lmaooo) Boomer stock, giving you a 4.87% dividend? The one that, if you somehow baghold can give you 10-15% cash returns through divitendies and covered calls until you get assigned at a strike that is profitable to you? The 10-15% backboard cash that can fund all your yolo's? That's the fucking stock you hesitate on? El LMAO. The companies margins will expand hard in a few months, and it's still hugely profitable at a less than 1 percent margin so yeah. Now if you were buying at 14 fucking bucks, you're a dumb ape, but yeah.

I'm fucking going to ride my options to a fucking profit margin that compensates me for the shit they pulled, or to a GUH. No in between. The Stock Buyback middle finger is just the fucking sweetener.

Matt Daddy, and I, and all the people who everyone called bag holders are going to skull fuck the shorters harder than they skull fucked UWMC's share price. They're going to fucking Guh their way into a fucking shoebox. Fuck em. I want me tendies well cooked, a side of fries, and a foot massage. And their going to give it to me. And to all of you who bought, and are buying UWMC.

The setup is a symmetrical triangle. Normally when continuation patterns come from downside - they have a bearish bias. However - we broke that red trendline  with an uptick in volume - this was a hint we were ready for an actual reversal. That trendline kept us in a downtrend for about 4 months. Not only that but...

**TODAY WE BROKE THE SYMMETRICAL TRIANGLE UP - WHICH MEANS ITS FULL SPEED AHEAD!**

Confluence between technicals generate the best signals.

This is the best the setup has looked since GME was at 10. Price target for this is 231.52 resistance initially, followed by 348.50. Breakout is invalid and play is dead if we get a daily close back under 158.11.

And... that's it.

I've been trading for a long time and only use patterns, trendlines & volume. Keep it simple. You don't need to waste 100 hours doing 15 paragraphs of DD for one swing trade - or look at 100 different indicators cherry picking the ones that say your position will go up.

***TL;DR*** \- GME actually looks good for once from an **unbiased** technical standpoint

***EDIT:*** Clarification - I wasn't speaking for GME as a whole when I said it was dead under 158.11 - I simply meant this setup in particular was no longer valid. It could always form a new one. I chose that level because it's the most significant one below the breakout point.",nexq9s,$GME TA - BIG BREAKOUT TODAY - SETUP LOOKS BETTER THAN IT EVER HAS

$CNK is AMCs largest competitor and is in the great business we know as movie theaters. When AMC last went crazy, CNK ran up over 56% in a few days from 22-27 of January to $27+. In the past month, AMC is up over 50%. CNK is roughly even. It is lagging behind and is due for a major pop on this AMC craze. It is a classically more boring stock that takes a big nudge to move.

Breaking out similar to AMC. Insanely strong volume shelf in low 20s (high demand) and above 1D 21MA. RSI has lots of room to run. 

**MARGIN**

CNK has a much lower implied volatility and actually allows for margin borrowing. This could be attractive depending on your risk appetite

**DILUTION/FINANCIALS**

CNK has almost no share dilution since the pandemic started, and it has been historically stronger than AMC from a traditional (retarded) financial perspective. AMCs market value growth has passed CNKs by many multiples over the past year. No reason she can't get some love.

Glacier Capital exists. That sentence isn't going to make me any friends, but your wallet needs to hear it. They've even written some insightful pieces which panned out as per the analyses; CVNA (link below) performed well in the short-term as predicted, but the majority shareholder and CEO sold practically all of his shares four days ago, al in line with their poor long-term outlook.

A lot of the theorising focuses on the founding year of the company. Look... the profile on Bloomberg is for a different Glacier Capital LLC. There appear to be quite a few Glacier Capital LLCs. In the US, LLC names are not unique on a federal level. Unrelated companies in different states can have exactly the same name.

When we consider that the CEO of *the* Glacier Capital was still a university student in 2005, we can safely conclude this isn't a smoking gun and it's likely we're tripping up over unrelated companies.

What does this mean for the short. Is it a bluff? Are billionaires phoning each other and bribing journos to falsify the existence of hedge funds? Idk, I'm just a sleep-deprived dickhead on stimmies who is concerned that someone on his second sunrise in one sleep cycle is exercising more calm and reason than people with 100x my net worth.

Look at the dates. When the whole GME surge was first kicking off, Glacier Capital filed to register for a 'Legal Entity Identifier' (LEI) in order to comply with 'Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II' (MiFID II), which was a tightening of regulations within the EU in 2008. LEIs are required in order to comply with MiFID II, and MiFID II needs to be complied with in order to carry out certain high risk activities, including forms/scales of derivatives.

I am not a European financial services lawyer but considering the timing of everything, it seems reasonable to assume that the short positions may be real - and if new certs were put in place just for one series of positions, then it isn't crazy to think they might be especially large.

Again, *I am not saying* that this isn't an incestuous industry or that the capital isn't coming from known players. I am specifically begging you not to be a fucking dumbfuck because of one Reddit-cum-Sherlock post so that whatever dumbass decision you make next is at least a little less erratic. I've been holding since January, I'm not telling you not to buy GME, this is not FUD. Just don't be allergic to facts. Know your risks.",nf5m0v,"""Glacier Capital"" DOES exist.

If you read those footnotes, you can see that some judges on the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (which is 7 very qualified federal judges) have recused themselves and others have had to renounce their claims (normal for judges) against the defendants to even participate, as they would have been members of the several putative actions.

1.**The Fed will cap yields and do whatever it takes to support the economy and markets‚Äîi.e., much more dollar printing.**

**Let me dig in !**

The recent NFIB survey suggests we are only in an economic recovery, not an expansion.

NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

üì∑

Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *‚Äúactually‚Äù* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *‚Äúdemand‚Äù* meets its operating cash flows.

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ew6w5tu19vz61.png?width=804&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bba4677ec15d513e78d6d19644722b133068a48

Businesses understand that the stimulus [***‚Äúpulled forward‚Äù***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)

much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***‚Äúcosts‚Äù*** **of** ***‚Äúlong-term employment‚Äù*** **for a** ***‚Äúshort-term‚Äù*** **artificial economic boost.**

The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.**¬†Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0bcfon349vz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=89b498f76db582407f08e593e10dc5692e6005f2

 

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive. Therefore **Fed will cap yields and do whatever it takes to support the economy , employment and markets.**

At the risk of repeating myself, the risk to the upside in the 30-Year yield is capped somewhere between 2.75-3.00%,

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w1cuikh69vz61.png?width=836&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b01f66a5badd3fc80e79abecd97096e309324a5

 

2. **Inflation will rise dramatically, and the risk is that it‚Äôll be worse than expected:**

We finally got ‚Äúofficial‚Äù confirmation in May that inflation has already begun to take off:

The headline CPI year-over-year increase at 4.2% was the highest since 2008. Energy prices rose 25% and gas prices 50%. Rising energy prices filter through to almost everything. Used car and truck prices were up 21%. Rents rose 2.1%. If you substitute home prices for rents, that number more than doubled.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1qccmij89vz61.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7c72ce894c8a9cddbf6a739715174d69d093229

 On top of all that, the CPI is widely understood to dramatically understate inflation, so the increases are much worse than the headline numbers. As I like to say, one just has to look at the performance of commodity futures over the past year, or go to Home Depot or the grocery store. It‚Äôs not rocket science. This will continue until the monetary and fiscal stimulus stops, small and medium-sized businesses return, and employment rises significantly. Don‚Äôt hold your breath, 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fjw00bba9vz61.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=a09d8f5b80ba4ea16d4fe02b812aa64a15ff8c3c

 

The month-over-month increases were far higher than expected, double in the case of the headline PPI. These are the prices that filter through to consumer prices over time‚Äîi.e., the CPI is likely going even higher.¬†

If that were not enough, wage inflation is on the rise, too, as employers struggle to get people off the couch who can otherwise live on their stimulus checks. Checks that are unlikely to be inflation indexed. Several States have already begun or are considering a ‚Äúreturn to work bonus‚Äù in order to get people to go back to work.

""Therefore I assume inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside .""

Conclusion and Goals :

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

The scenario to play out in weeks in precious Metals ;

 

Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and Gold and the metals soar.Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields.I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks.

Gold & silver's monthly defined 2021 road map still intact. Q2 and Q4 belong to silver, while gold will shine in Q3. For Silver q2 /2021 my targets are 42 Usd /ozz while gold 1.900 Usd/ozz .

I  have shared my thoughts on UWMC in past. The company announced Q1  earnings and while they look like they are below expectations it was  explained by the CEO that because of the speed of their execution, their  results are reflective of the higher rate environment already while  competitors are lagged.

During    the Q4 2020 earnings call he  had mused about options that would be on    the stable, special dividend,  buyback or raising the dividend.

**Feb Q4 Earnings Quote:**

The     Board did approve a dividend, a $0.10 quarterly dividend to be  paid    on  April 6 for all shareholders of record as of March 10. **We expect  this to be a regular quarterly dividend**.

And     so you guys know how we're thinking about this. Our balance sheet   is  a   fortress. And our current liquidity position is very strong, and    we   have access to the capital markets as well. The way we think  about   this   going forward is we're producing a lot of cash. We're  going to   maybe   be more profitable than some expected and be very  successful in   2021.   And **if we have excess cash that I and the Board deem is too much,  we will be delivering that back**. And whether we have to **change     the  dividend in the future, as in raise it or a special dividend,     those  things are definitely on the table or even buying back shares**.

**May Q1 Earnings Quote:**

As     you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of      $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a      record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I always  **explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special  dividend or a share buyback program**. As you guys have seen, we **concluded      share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward   shareholders.    We announced the authorization of $300 million share   buyback over the    next 24 months**.  And **quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that**.

**Then in answering a question from an analyst**

Doug    Harter -  Great. And then just in terms of capital return, you    mentioned sort of  the float. I  guess just how are you thinking about    kind of **how much of  the float  you'd be willing to take out and pacing around share  repurchase**?

Mat Ishbia -  Yes, Doug. So I'm learning these rules as we go **because at this stock  price, I'm a buyer, right**?    And so we'll buy shares as soon as tomorrow, I  think, as our legal    teams say we're allowed to do. And so I don't know  how many I can buy    and what I can do, but I'm very conscientious of the  float.  If the    float was not a concern, **we'd be more aggressive**. However,  **we     have authorization from the Board to buy up to $300 million, and I'm      going to take advantage of that opportunity while being  conscientious     of our partners in the float.**

TL/DR:     UWMC and their board have been looking at ways to give back to     shareholders. Instead of a short term cash out, they decided on a     buyback that they are planning to exercise immediately on so that they     can retire shares while the SP is low. They will NOT buy so much that   it   will ruin their float % for Russell. The CEO is aggressive, has    approval to spend $300 and he's going to take FULL advantage.  The CEO has stated he is a BUYER! They are  not   waiting, it's being deployed now.

If we can open above 6.9 (50day SMA) I think we can close around that 7.14 (200day SMA) level which should line us up for that move out of the $6-$8 range and into the $10s and beyond.

Now funny enough what actually has me the most bullish this morning is looking at Friday alone. Selling pressure was suppressed by the bulls and it closed right near HOD above all major resistances.

UWMC is ready to pop!

I was in UWMC for the value play. It is a STEAL at 10$ on fundamentals anything below that is an insane deal. Even above 10 has a strong long-term argument.

Here is UWMC in a nutshell: heavily shorted, borrow costs skyrocketing, mortgage industry hit overly hard on fears of rising interest rates, the CEO Ishiba announces a 300M stock buyback, and shorts are QUAKING. UP 6% in premarket following being up 1-2% Friday. This puts at starting at $8 Monday with $9 being a CRITICAL Friday target for us.

All UWMC needs is a little unexpected retail buying pressure and it POPS! In truth this is not just a short squeeze, its multiple plays rolled into one. We have retail buying hype train going (obviously, look at all the WSB posts here posted below), short-squeeze due to high cost of borrow, Gamma squeeze due to the MASSIVE options interest, 300M stock buyback by CEO to scare off the shorts, an unfair post-earnings plunge, plus good-ole\` company doing good things (making money).

We coming back for some of our loyal bagholders that have been holding UWMC since the last train to $14, hey guys remember to take profit this time ;)

It is now cost-prohibitive to use more shorts to keep the price low. The normal dirty tricks triple in price so become less-used. Shorts use this borrow price to determine feasibility and 93% is obviously unfeasible, THEY WILL COVER. Once one group starts covering and causes a spike, other shorts will rush to do the same.

It's a prisoner's dilemma and HF's want to cut each other's throats just as much as ours. Let's let them!!!

Many of these 7.50,9. 10, and 12 are OTM or barely ITM. and an early week spike to put 9c ITM would force MM's to hedge to delta-neutral...further pushing 10c and 12.50 c into hedge territory. This can quickly cause things to spiral out of control for shorts.

Stock BuyBack,

Ishbia is going to war with the shorts and his weapon of choice is a 300M stock buyback (similar to RKT's special dividend for the same purpose). The buyback could have started happening as early as May 11th.

Most of the float is owned by institutions and insiders so this buyback puts increased pressure of a heavily shorted (13%+) and heavily held float pool.

Retail is gorging on the float, institutions are holding the float, and Ishbia is buying the free float up. This is a recipe for ROCKET FUEL. WIth shorts paying 93%, they will stop shorting so the shares we are buying are REAL, not synthetic.

Make them buy real shares, from us, at 20$ each.

I am in UWMC for the long-term VALUE-PLAY and like the stock. I like the company., I like the CEO. I like the market position. I like the value. I ilke the stock.

I am loading up on 6/18 8c options. Options are important as we move up to force MM's to buy to remain market neutral.

Options do not pay unless we buy shares, so I suggest splitting half/half to each. options can cause MM's to balance risk and lead to large upswings but this cannot happen without buying pressure and the underlying spiking to necessitate balancing risk, which means we need to buy stocks as well.

Options are good for Gamma Squeeze/MM's balance buys (and profit) but shares are needed to keep the underlying JOOSED and keep those options deep ITM.

5113,,2021-05-17 13:20:55,t3_neg3ey,,wallstreetbets,"$UWMC has become one of the most hyped stocks in the online investment community. Online activity appears to be ramping up after earnings and heading into May 21st option expiries. Since UWM is getting a lot of new eyes, it seemed like an appropriate time to share why some investors may consider UWM as a long term hold. 

UWM is a mortgage company that focuses exclusively on the broker channel. It‚Äôs the largest wholesale mortgage provider in the US and the second largest mortgage originator, behind Rocket Companies. 

It‚Äôs CEO is Mat Ishbia, who started as it‚Äôs 12th employee and who‚Äôs dad, Jeff, started the company as a side hustle. Mat and his brother own 94% of the company in Class D shares. The rest of the public float, \~100m Class A shares, are what is available for the public to purchase. 

# What trends are pushing $UWMC‚Äôs stock down? 

**The largest threat UWM is facing is raising interest rates**: 

About 75% of UWM income is related to refinance activity. The pandemic pushed rates to historic lows so most consumers were better off refinancing. Millions have done that, leading to record profit for mortgage providers like UWM and Rocket. 

**The strength of the broker channel:**

UWM is completely dependent on brokers finding business and closing loans. It doesn‚Äôt have any direct-to-consumer lending operations like Rocket does. 

**Short Interest:** 

Sophisticated investors are seeing 75% of income potentially attached to rate sensitive products (not all refi‚Äôs are rate sensitive like cash out), and are salivating. They think the market is under appreciating this headwind and shorting the stock. They have basically shorted all the shares they can. Friday the stock ended with 200 shares available and an insane 93% borrow rate. 

**SPAC:**

It is true that the SPAC market has softened recently. It is very reasonable to assume $UWMC is a part of that softening. It may not attract institutional investors because of the SPAC situation and the short period it has been publicly traded. Lots of other nice places to put institutional money.

**Competitors:** Mortgages are a mature market and competition is fierce. Rocket, LoanDepot and UWM mentioned a pricing war in their earnings. (LD statement). This will compress loan sale margins in the short term. 

**What trends are pushing $UWMC stock up?** 

**Short term retail pressure:**

there is a lot of retail attention on the potential short squeeze/gamma squeeze you could see this week in UWMC. My post is about UWM‚Äôs long term perspective, so I‚Äôll let [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ndcm0p/uwmc_is_a_powderkeg_low_float_high_short_huge/) take you further down that rabbit hole. Additionally, smart money is now tracking online sentiment, which can lead to increased institutional purchases. 

**Broker Channel Growth:** Mat has claimed two reasons for taking UWM public. He wanted access to the liquidity market and marketing exposure for the broker channel. For UWM to become the largest mortgage originator, Mat has targeted ‚Öì mortgages to be originated by brokers and UWM to own 50% of that channel by 2025/26. Currently UWM owns 36% of the broker channel with brokers originating 20% of all mortgages. Before the housing crisis in 2008, brokers were 58% of mortgage originations (Per Mat & Q1 2021 Earnings call), so it isn‚Äôt crazy to think they could get back to ‚Öì as it is growing: [https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum](https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum)

I had a loan with Rocket and tried to refinance with them. I then went through a mortgage broker and got the same loan for $4.5k cheaper in closing costs. This is because Rocket‚Äôs retail channel has 4% margins and it‚Äôs partnership network (includes wholesale, realtors, etc.) has 1% margins. 

**New Product Offerings:** 

UWM recently released new products like their jumbo loan. In earnings, Mat said he expects $2b in volume from Jumbo. They also added ARM‚Äôs, manufactured homes and expanded government programs. 

**Wholesale mortgage provider consolidation:** 

Mat said 3 of the top 25 wholesale lenders have been purchased in the last 90 days. This type of consolidation happens in mature markets by companies that are reaching for market share. THis could be a sign companies are under pressure to grow but cannot organically get market share from UWM. 

**UWM ‚ÄúAll In‚Äù Ultimatum:** 

Rocket and Fairway are priortizing other channels (cause the margins are so much higher) and trying to squeeze out brokers. UWM said if you work with those two, don‚Äôt work for us. The goal was to stand up for the broker channel WHILE putting some pressure on Rocket and Fairway‚Äôs partnership channel. This may have kickstarted the pricing war. 

**Aggressive Capital returns:** 

UWM pays an annual .40 dividend on its class A shares. That only costs them \~$42m/year. Remember their Q1 net income was $800m+. So their dividends hardly affect the balance sheet. The board just approved a $300/million share buyback as well that will reduce share count. Mat knows a thing or two about shorting stocks. He just sold at $10 and has authority to buy back with the current price under $8. The man successfully shorted his own company. What a legend. 

**Long Term Prediction:** 

I‚Äôm invested in UWM because I believe the capital returns will be aggressive during the upswing and the company will remain profitable in a downturn. With a 5%+ dividend return, share buyback, and \*potentially\* growing market share, UWM could be primed to overtake Rocket within the next few years.

Large social media sites take in a tremendous amount of data each day. This storage must not only be stored, but stored with redundancy as well as backups. Major sites such as Facebook and YouTube keep content that is over a decade old. Over time, the drives holding this content will fail and need to be replaced, leading to growing recurring demand as the size of the platform grows.

The need for storage has been growing for decades, but innovation in storage density and intense competition has limited profitability in the market in the past. That being said, there is reason to believe that the growth in storage density may stop keeping up with the growth in storage needs.

There is also reason to believe that transient growth in storage demand may drive higher Q2 earnings. A new digital currency, Chia, has gobbled up about 6 Exabytes worth of storage in the past 3 weeks, now growing at a rate of about 0.4 EiB per day(and rising). https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/netspace

For reference, about 288 Exabytes worth of hard drives were shipped in Q1 2021 https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hdd-shipments-in-q1-2021

Chia network size can be considered a lagging indicator for unexpected drive shipments. Generally, it can take a few weeks between when a drive is purchased and when it's actually accounted for on the network, as it takes time for it to be shipped, set up, and plotted. Chia wasn't even listed on exchanges until a couple weeks ago, so most of the growth seen is prior to Chia even having a price. At current prices, mining is incredibly profitable, with a $500 14 TB drive estimated to produce about $26 per day, and using very little power. So even if the network grows 10x to 60 Exabytes, it's still producing $3/day at current prices. So expect the surge in demand to continue.

I have seen many anecdotes of drive shortages over the past couple weeks. Reviewing sites like Amazon, I have also seen high capacity drives go out of stock or require lead times of a few weeks.

This may be a bit reminiscent of GPU shortages among Nvidia and AMD as miners seek to buy up anything they can.

If we project continued growth at 0.4 Exabytes a day in unexpected demand from proof of storage over the next 40 days, plus the 6 Exabytes added since April 20(leaving out first 3 weeks in quarter as they were likely logged last quarter), that's about 22 Exabytes to be added in Q2 that are not part of normal usage, or about an extra ~8% of Q1 demand.

What's perhaps most interesting is the impact this could have on margins. Unlike the GPUs used to mine which are consumer devices, the devices used for mining Chia includes enterprise grade hardware. Prices in the drive market are more flexible at the manufacturer level, and currently have much lower margins. If proof of storage currencies cause a drive shortage, it could have a significant impact on margins. Western digital sells about 40% of its drives through distributors, Seagate about 30%. Sales through these channels generally are very responsive to demand trends in terms of prices.

Seagate is also in a position to profit from this, but I'm a bit more worried about them as hard drive shipments have been on a long term decline and they aren't diversified into SSDs/flash like Western Digital is.

The EMA (EU medical agency like FDA) announced Myovant and Relugolix as up for review to be accepted for Marketing approval in the EU this week. This is a huge catalyst in the biotech industry, and due to their Pfizer partnership this could result in a 50m cash payment to Myovant as well.

They also have an FDA PDUFA deadline of June 1 for a second application (their first of three was approved in December). If approved this would result in a 100m cash payment from Pfizer.

Alone, these are major catalysts. Right now they stand to go back to back on these catalysts. The last time the company had one catalyst like this, **they were rocketed past $30 a share and gained a strategic partnership from Pfizer.**

Now those are two major catalysts within two weeks, **if FDA decides early, both could happen this week.**

Due to the triple threat data put up in clinical trials and the fact that they had this data peer reviewed and published in the New England journal of medicine, there is strong confidence of approval on the company‚Äôs end.

Last but not least, they have additional catalysts still inbound after. Including Part D and Medicare coverage expected by July 1. All encompassed with a possible buyout from sumitomo.

If you're looking for a good article that covers the basics, you can search the below. Theres also some great posts on reddit and stock twits. I am also happy to answer any questions.

*Why The Misunderstood Pfizer Deal Makes Myovant A Great Low-Risk Investment*

**Quick list of upcoming catalysts:**

THIS WEEK: EMA meets to possibly approve sale of orgovyx in Europe

By June 1: Deadline for FDA approval for a second use case (this could come early and will result in another 100m cash payment from Pfizer)

By July 1: Part d and Medicare coverage: also supposed to be obtained before July 1 for prostate cancer application

Pfizer optionality: Pfizer can opt in to have the rights to sell this in some markets, resulting in a 50m cash payment and royalties paid to myovant. Submission of relugolix for the treatment of endometriosis to the FDA

Catalysts that could happen at any time:  **BUYOUT** from Sumitomo ( aka Sumitovant) or other interested partner (See Urovant history. Sumi has a patent cliff in 2023 they are trying to patch with acquisitions, has purchased 4 of movants sister companies and already owns 53.5% of myovant).

It sounds like an impossibility, but there are simple ways to reading a price chart that enable you to come very close to predicting the direction and turning points of a stock. One of the most important ways is through the identification and marking of channel line patterns.

&#x200B;

[ Prices respect the channel lines ](https://preview.redd.it/fqzpk486qpz61.png?width=1067&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5b02809e77b0f9d4f8162cd558a98154a5aad8e)

Channels lines are one of the most important patterns found on a price chart. They enable you to find the broader trend, or overall direction prices are heading, which is crucial towards choosing the direction of your trade. Sticking with the trend - going long on an uptrend and short on a downtrend - aligns you with the higher probability direction, already setting yourself up for a probable trade.

They also enable you to anticipate and profit from areas where the price has a high likelihood of reversing through a ""bounce"" - where prices hit an upper or lower side of the channel and bounce off of the level like a ball, and heading into the opposite direction. These are key areas because unlike a random point in the chart, a channel line presents a point that has a higher probability of doing one thing over another - *this is an example of where ""edge"" comes from - finding scenarios where one outcome is more likely than the other, and betting on it.*

&#x200B;

[ Channel line pattern with bounces circled ](https://preview.redd.it/f0l668a7qpz61.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=658f753348044acec2cceeaa1dfbf4c6288ae0ff)

## How do you define a channel pattern?

A channel line pattern exists when prices are moving between two parallel trendlines. A trendline is a straight line drawn to connect several major turning points, or swings, in the price chart. When there are two identifiable trendlines that are parallel to each other forming a straight band, prices are *trading within a channel*.

&#x200B;

[ A trendline drawn off of the highs ](https://preview.redd.it/fcfpptc8qpz61.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc81911e78d6e9ee5012760fc53e05f6200513b2)

Trendlines and channels are drawings that highlight the foundational concept of understanding price charts - support and resistance. Support is a level that lies underneath the current price that historically has acted as a cushion for prices, slowing their momentum or causing them to turn right around. Resistance is a level that lies above the current price that historically has acted as a barrier for prices, slowing their momentum or causing a reversal. In this way, support and resistance are one and the same - they are levels that ""support"" or ""resist"", keeping prices within their confines until they lose their power.

&#x200B;

>Prices will often ""test"" support and resistance multiple times and the level will successfully hold, creating areas with a high probability of a bounce - therefore creating trading opportunities.

## How to Draw Channel Lines

So, trendlines connect two or more support or resistance zones, which are areas where prices reversed or showed slowing momentum. Channels are two parallel trendlines. With that, *how can you draw a channel line on a price chart*?

The first consideration is if there is a channel at all. Often, there are ample opportunities to draw trendlines - straight lines connecting s/r. However, it is less often that the chart shows another parallel trendline that price has interacted with. Thus, a textbook ""channel"" with prices neatly filling in the space and bouncing off of the lines is not as easy as it seems to find - **this actually makes the pattern more important, as the discovery of a true channel pattern can lead to very clean bounces and high probability, low risk trades.**

To draw a channel, first find a trendline. Connect important swing lows or highs, and try to find a way to draw a line that connects two or more of the swings, while keeping all of of the other price movement between the swings above the line.

&#x200B;

[ First trendline duplicated and dragged to mark swing lows ](https://preview.redd.it/ss3uggaaqpz61.png?width=561&format=png&auto=webp&s=56e6198235392485a05edaddc3f8d0da4d802d4c)

>A trendline is only as significant as the prices' respect for it - there is no validity to drawing a trendline that connects two swings, while is broken by three other spikes.

Once you've found the trendline, either duplicate the trendline you have just drawn, or if using a channel drawing tool, simply drag the parallel line to see if it can connect two more swings on the opposite side of the price movement.

It takes *a lot* of practice to begin to properly draw channel lines that are valid and are respected by prices. Drawing channel patterns that match historical price charts is hard - and drawing them in a way that can successfully anticipate *future* price movements is even more of a learned skill. This can only be improved by practicing drawing channels on many different charts.

## Types of Channel Lines

The direction of channel lines determine the type of channel pattern. A channel pointed at an upward sloping angle signals an uptrend. A channel pointed at a downward angle signals a downtrend. A channel with a horizontal slope signals a range.

&#x200B;

[ Uptrend ](https://preview.redd.it/s8h4o1xbqpz61.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=1df032e442d4dddf112e30748baedcff16656291)

A concept that is helpful in the identification of a channel's direction is the presence of swing highs and lows. If prices are making higher swings high (peaks) and higher swings low (troughs), chances are they are in an uptrend. If prices are making lower highs and lower lows, they are likely in a downtrend. If there are equal or mismatching swing lows and highs, and prices look more horizontal, a range is likely in play.

&#x200B;

[ Downtrend with channel break ](https://preview.redd.it/wovf3mvcqpz61.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0029bb3d64ea2cb1da1b122a2e477cd0ce827d)

In a trending market, sticking with the direction of the trend can put you on the higher probability side. Combined with an entry identified by the channel lines, this can form the basis of a trading strategy.

In a ranging market, where prices are simply bouncing between two horizontal support and resistance trendlines, any time prices approach or touch the channel lines can be a significant reversal area, where there is a higher probability of a bounce than a breakout through the line.

&#x200B;

[Range](https://preview.redd.it/6z1kj65eqpz61.png?width=1019&format=png&auto=webp&s=3196922b3ddd01cd806ca9f100aa01918bf0b766)

## The Midline and Channel Pattern Breaks

Many channel drawing tools can display a midline, or a line 50% away from both trendlines. This line can serve as an important secondary trendline or support/resistance zone, and often prices react to the midline in a less apparent, but still significant way. Additionally, sometimes prices will break the channel line and form a new high outside of the channel. When this happens, the broken trendline can sometimes become the midline of a wider channel that incorporates the new swing.

&#x200B;

[ Upper channel line turned into midline after breakout ](https://preview.redd.it/wz5gw1peqpz61.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=68d55d124e5799ccc86ac01d5f860786ef24d183)

*When prices break a channel line, it is a sign that the pattern is losing validity.* The trend may be losing steam or accelerating, based on if it breaks the lower or the upper line. A channel line pattern is most valid when there are no price breaks of the trendlines. When prices break the countertrend side (the lower line in an uptrend or the upper line in a downtrend), you can anticipate a reversal soon. When prices break the with-trend side, the trend has accelerated, and you may need to redraw your channel line. This can also be seen as an expenditure of momentum which can bring a trend channel back into a range or a reversal.

## How to Trade With Channel Lines

Because channel line patterns offer areas that have *a higher probability of moving in one direction over the other*, trading strategies can be formed around the pattern. After identifying a valid channel, a strategy may look to buy or sell as price touches the with-trend channel line, setting a stop loss level based on volatility, Fibonacci extensions, or a selection of indicators that can identify momentum and turning points. A take profit level could be determined by a significant support/resistance level, Fibonacci retracements, or indicators similar to those used in stop placement.

&#x200B;

The key advantage to trading channel bounces is the **high risk to reward** offered. A tight stop loss can allow for a high R:R ratio even with a high probability, modest profit target level. Thus, the strategy utilizes *a high probability turning point, a tight stop loss, and a modest profit target* which culminates into a trading plan with a healthy win rate and risk to reward ratio.

Finally, an overlooked aspect of using channels:

&#x200B;

>Channel line patterns have one final key importance to trading - they let you know when to not be in. This helps to reinforce a golden rule of trading - only look to enter trades when there is a higher probability of one thing happening over the other. By watching your channel lines, you'll know when it's there.

5129,,2021-05-17 17:38:52,t3_nemlpe,,wallstreetbets,"So right now, the mainstream narrative is that inflation is going to run red hot mostly due to a rally in commodity prices. This inflation has the potential to be more than transitory, meaning it lasts more than a couple of quarters at most and will result in forcing the FED to raise rates and crash growth stocks. This is why tech stocks are underperforming while value, or more specifically, manufacturing and mining companies outperform (look at XME for example).

My question is if that is the case, then why are steel futures for U.S. Midwest Domestic Hot-Rolled Coil Steel going down [CME Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/ferrous/hrc-steel_quotes_globex.html)? Right now they peak in June at $1,520 a tonne before steadily going down for the foreseeable future.

Similar things can be said about other commodities such as copper, which remains relatively steady before gradually going down going into next year [Copper Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/base/copper_quotes_globex.html).

On the agriculture side, major commodities like corn appear to be peaking in the near future as well [Corn Futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/grain-and-oilseed/corn_quotes_globex.html).

So taking all of this into account, it would appear that the shape of the futures curves would indicate that commodity prices would peak in near future before gradually going down as supply meets demand. Shouldn't this mean that inflation is indeed transitory as the FED predicts? What am I missing here?

**Tl;Dr:** Futures are showing commodity prices going down in the near future which should drag down inflation rates. Are inflation fears misplaced?",nemlpe,Are Commodity Futures Going Against The Mainstream Inflation Narrative?

In June, UiPath was named to the CNBC 2020 Disruptor 50 ranking [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/16/uipath-disruptor-50.html].

Last month $path went public with only 23million shares as IPO. In addition, UiPath has granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 3,583,616. All together that's less than 25 million shares. 


ARK already snapped 6.4 million shares of path. Minus the ARK's shares, there are less than 19 million shares available.

Wendy's can obviously tweet some witty stuff that will get lots of likes and retweets, but this usually doesn't motivate most people to sign up for extra ads on their timeline by actually following these accounts.

Wingstop, however, cracked the code on Wednesday by denying the presence of ejaculate in their special white sauce. On Wednesday, one customer tweeted ""wingstop ranch gotta have nut in it no way it‚Äôs just that good"" to which Wingstop replied ""it's a special white sauce but it does not contain \[nut\]""

I think you guys may remember me, after all I wrote an extensive series of DD over a month on UWMC through its trials and tribulations, in anticipation of it's breakout moment. You might even remember my YOLO, and remembered I continuously added to it. And that I eventually upped my margin to 13.5k on it. Well, I'm here to tell you that I'm not out. I bought more calls to average down, on earnings day, and I held them when they tanked to ten cents a pop. My only regret is that I didn't buy more then. Though I threw a bit more cash into shares!

Back then, I said the Theta Beta's would regret selling those calls, and it was one of the few plays where there wouldn't be IV Crush. I was right. Their probably a little sour. Sorry chaps, you usually are the one's making money at our expense. This time it's going to have to be the other way around....

Today, I had the chance to exit my options for a 47% profit roughly. Sell calls for a chunky profit after that. I said no. You know why? Because fuck the people who shorted an extremely profitable company to 6.26 dollars, that's why. The Fear, the Uncertainty, and the Doubt people expressed to me regarding this company espoused to me because of the actions of those people gave me an aneurysm. So fuck them. We're playing Pac Man people. The CEO of UWMC is reducing the float, and increasing the percentage of the float that is sold short while increasing buying pressure. We're buying up the stock to get the price to 9-10 because people bought options for 5-10 cents and they'll be in the money quite easily. And because of the rising volume, every day the CEO is able to buy more and more shares thanks to Rule 10B. The delta on the options is low, and they will need to hedge as the price heads steadily upward on Friday. Then the Shorts are going to be squeezed even further as the market makers hedge.

So no, I won't sell my options for a 10 or a 50% profit. I'm going to sell my options at a price I damn well want to. One that compensates me for the trouble that these people have given me. And so should you.

I understand people have taken profits, but honestly, at the price point they were selling at the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. Good for them though. Next time, could you at least sell deep ITM covered calls though lmao.

And for those people on the fucking fence. You jumped onto MVIS, you jumped into GME, and AMC, and all manners of companies that are either unprofitable or make very little money. But the fucking BOOMER stock is where you hesitate the fence?! The fucking (Eyy Lmaooo) Boomer stock, giving you a 4.87% dividend? The one that, if you somehow baghold can give you 10-15% cash returns through divitendies and covered calls until you get assigned at a strike that is profitable to you? The 10-15% backboard cash that can fund all your yolo's? That's the fucking stock you hesitate on? El LMAO. The companies margins will expand hard in a few months, and it's still hugely profitable at a less than 1 percent margin so yeah. Now if you were buying at 14 fucking bucks, you're a dumb ape, but yeah.

I'm fucking going to ride my options to a fucking profit margin that compensates me for the shit they pulled, or to a GUH. No in between. The Stock Buyback middle finger is just the fucking sweetener.

Matt Daddy, and I, and all the people who everyone called bag holders are going to skull fuck the shorters harder than they skull fucked UWMC's share price. They're going to fucking Guh their way into a fucking shoebox. Fuck em. I want me tendies well cooked, a side of fries, and a foot massage. And their going to give it to me.

They did it with blockbuster but they were more vocal about it, and in turn their stock price plummeted for 4 years because the people found out what they did after they went under and hiked prices by 60%. *but that was soon forgotten*

\-Netflix still has a mail out service, it would be lucrative if they put GME out of business and take over

\- It would be great if Netflix could take over in person movie theaters..

5166,,2021-05-18 01:34:15,t3_nexq9s,,wallstreetbets,"I don't normally play meme stocks - but I thought the GME technical setup was especially intriguing recently.

[GME TA](https://preview.redd.it/1tmj448o6sz61.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=1de6593bb253ff2a102250d3e4a97d521e0b3455)

The setup is a symmetrical triangle. Normally when continuation patterns come from downside - they have a bearish bias. However - we broke that red trendline  with an uptick in volume - this was a hint we were ready for an actual reversal. That trendline kept us in a downtrend for about 4 months. Not only that but...

**TODAY WE BROKE THE SYMMETRICAL TRIANGLE UP - WHICH MEANS ITS FULL SPEED AHEAD!**

Confluence between technicals generate the best signals.

This is the best the setup has looked since GME was at 10. Price target for this is 231.52 resistance initially, followed by 348.50. Breakout is invalid and play is dead if we get a daily close back under 158.11.

And... that's it.

I've been trading for a long time and only use patterns, trendlines & volume. Keep it simple. You don't need to waste 100 hours doing 15 paragraphs of DD for one swing trade - or look at 100 different indicators cherry picking the ones that say your position will go up.

***TL;DR*** \- GME actually looks good for once from an **unbiased** technical standpoint

***EDIT:*** Clarification - I wasn't speaking for GME as a whole when I said it was dead under 158.11 - I simply meant this setup in particular was no longer valid. It could always form a new one. I chose that level because it's the most significant one below the breakout point.",nexq9s,$GME TA - BIG BREAKOUT TODAY - SETUP LOOKS BETTER THAN IT EVER HAS

AMC READY TO FLY.

Plenty of DD has been done on AMC and why its going to take off - I'm not here to talk about that. It is coiled, has popped, and is ready to rip a new butthole in the sky.

$CNK is AMCs largest competitor and is in the great business we know as movie theaters. When AMC last went crazy, CNK ran up over 56% in a few days from 22-27 of January to $27+. In the past month, AMC is up over 50%. CNK is roughly even. It is lagging behind and is due for a major pop on this AMC craze. It is a classically more boring stock that takes a big nudge to move.

Breaking out similar to AMC. Insanely strong volume shelf in low 20s (high demand) and above 1D 21MA. RSI has lots of room to run. 

**MARGIN**

CNK has a much lower implied volatility and actually allows for margin borrowing. This could be attractive depending on your risk appetite

**DILUTION/FINANCIALS**

CNK has almost no share dilution since the pandemic started, and it has been historically stronger than AMC from a traditional (retarded) financial perspective. AMCs market value growth has passed CNKs by many multiples over the past year. No reason she can't get some love.

Don't overthink it. We love this guy. Fuck you and lets make some money:

His $TSLA puts are generating the most interest from the media, but the position that stuck out most to me is his puts on $TLT, the 20-year treasury bond etf. It makes sense, if inflation really is upon us, the fed will have to raise rates soon. Higher rates = lower price per bond = lower $TLT. This seems way too intuitive and I feel like an idiot for not thinking of it a month ago, but obviously that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not Dr. Burry. I‚Äôm sure he got in a while ago and is already up a bunch of money, but I feel like there are still gains to be made in this trade in the months ahead.

The reason I‚Äôm posting is that $TLT has already come down a fair amount in the past month, but this still seems like an easy money play on inflation. Is there something I‚Äôm missing or is it really that simple? The 13F for Scion Asset Management doesn‚Äôt detail the strike price or expiration for the puts, but I‚Äôm thinking about going in for a few 1/21/22 $125 puts on $TLT.

Glacier Capital exists. That sentence isn't going to make me any friends, but your wallet needs to hear it. They've even written some insightful pieces which panned out as per the analyses; CVNA (link below) performed well in the short-term as predicted, but the majority shareholder and CEO sold practically all of his shares four days ago, al in line with their poor long-term outlook.

A lot of the theorising focuses on the founding year of the company. Look... the profile on Bloomberg is for a different Glacier Capital LLC. There appear to be quite a few Glacier Capital LLCs. In the US, LLC names are not unique on a federal level. Unrelated companies in different states can have exactly the same name.

When we consider that the CEO of *the* Glacier Capital was still a university student in 2005, we can safely conclude this isn't a smoking gun and it's likely we're tripping up over unrelated companies.

Look at the dates. When the whole GME surge was first kicking off, Glacier Capital filed to register for a 'Legal Entity Identifier' (LEI) in order to comply with 'Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II' (MiFID II), which was a tightening of regulations within the EU in 2008. LEIs are required in order to comply with MiFID II, and MiFID II needs to be complied with in order to carry out certain high risk activities, including forms/scales of derivatives.

I am not a European financial services lawyer but considering the timing of everything, it seems reasonable to assume that the short positions may be real - and if new certs were put in place just for one series of positions, then it isn't crazy to think they might be especially large.

Again, *I am not saying* that this isn't an incestuous industry or that the capital isn't coming from known players. I am specifically begging you not to be a fucking dumbfuck because of one Reddit-cum-Sherlock post so that whatever dumbass decision you make next is at least a little less erratic.

The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *‚Äúactually‚Äù* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *‚Äúdemand‚Äù* meets its operating cash flows.

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

Businesses understand that the stimulus [***‚Äúpulled forward‚Äù***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)

much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***‚Äúcosts‚Äù*** **of** ***‚Äúlong-term employment‚Äù*** **for a** ***‚Äúshort-term‚Äù*** **artificial economic boost.**

The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.**¬†Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive. Therefore **Fed will cap yields and do whatever it takes to support the economy , employment and markets.**

At the risk of repeating myself, the risk to the upside in the 30-Year yield is capped somewhere between 2.75-3.00%,

2. **Inflation will rise dramatically, and the risk is that it‚Äôll be worse than expected:**

We finally got ‚Äúofficial‚Äù confirmation in May that inflation has already begun to take off:

The headline CPI year-over-year increase at 4.2% was the highest since 2008. Energy prices rose 25% and gas prices 50%. Rising energy prices filter through to almost everything. Used car and truck prices were up 21%. Rents rose 2.1%. If you substitute home prices for rents, that number more than doubled.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1qccmij89vz61.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7c72ce894c8a9cddbf6a739715174d69d093229

 On top of all that, the CPI is widely understood to dramatically understate inflation, so the increases are much worse than the headline numbers. As I like to say, one just has to look at the performance of commodity futures over the past year, or go to Home Depot or the grocery store. It‚Äôs not rocket science. This will continue until the monetary and fiscal stimulus stops, small and medium-sized businesses return, and employment rises significantly. Don‚Äôt hold your breath, 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fjw00bba9vz61.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=a09d8f5b80ba4ea16d4fe02b812aa64a15ff8c3c

 

The month-over-month increases were far higher than expected, double in the case of the headline PPI. These are the prices that filter through to consumer prices over time‚Äîi.e., the CPI is likely going even higher.¬†

If that were not enough, wage inflation is on the rise, too, as employers struggle to get people off the couch who can otherwise live on their stimulus checks. Checks that are unlikely to be inflation indexed. Several States have already begun or are considering a ‚Äúreturn to work bonus‚Äù in order to get people to go back to work.

""Therefore I assume inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside .""

Conclusion and Goals :

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

The scenario to play out in weeks in precious Metals ;

 

Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and Gold and the metals soar.Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields.I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks.

Gold & silver's monthly defined 2021 road map still intact. Q2 and Q4 belong to silver, while gold will shine in Q3. For Silver q2 /2021 my targets are 42 Usd /ozz while gold 1.900 Usd/ozz .

Example:

Lets say I like AMC.  Today it costs 13.95.  I buy 100 shares of AMC stock from a brokerage.  Cost of 100 shares will be $1,395.

On Fidelity, you can buy the stock and sell a covered call on the stock you just bought in one transaction.

So I buy 100 shares AMC and sell May 21 strike 16 call option for $66 (its listed as .66, but all options contracts are 100 shares so multiple by 100).  You would have gotten more for this, but one day expired already (Monday).  The transaction appears as buy 100 shares AMC and sell 1 options contract (might be referred to as buy/write), but Fidelity has a video on this as does YouTube.  It is a covered call.  You cover the call option with your shares that can be recalled if the strike price of AMC reaches 16 before the end of trading on May 21.  Your shares will automatically be sold, but if this happens, you already gained the $2.05 on each AMC share plus you keep the $66 covered call premium.

Lets look at the put option to hedge against a big loss to the value of the 100 AMC shares. The put for Sep 17 is a good value at strike 12.  It costs 3.38 or $338, but I could go longer term and further out of the money to save initial cost.  I could do I Jan 21 2022 str 10 put for 3.15 or $315.  My opinion is the longer, further out option would be a better value but you risk the stock either going very high to negate the put or the volume dropping enough so your call premiums go down because no one is buying them as much as before.

Total cost for set up...

100 shares AMC $1,395

Jan 21 2022 str 10 put $315

Total $1,710

I then sell $2 out one week covered calls every Monday or Tuesday for roughly $65 to $85",,

So, actually he‚Äòs betting either on (very‚Ä¶?) high inflation, increasing interest rates, default (S&P threatening the US government to take away the AAA bond rating), demand declining. Wtf‚Ä¶ easy short. Also he is betting on private prisons (or was betting)‚Ä¶ bc higher inflation = more crime‚Ä¶ alcohol going up. His bet is against the US economy. 

Ofc you would be fucking afraid to pull off the ‚Äûbig short squeeze‚Äú that wrecks havoc the entire financial/economic system. 

FTDs in May 2020 were 60% when his brokers searched for his shares. 

Rehypothecation was probably maxed out at 140% SI, lmao. Just need the answer: are counterfeit shares without rehypothecation visible to the market as a short position? 

Probably not :p actually I‚Äòll look for that.

And again: IF HE IS THE REASON TO FUCK THE ENTIRE SYSTEM HE HAS GOT A MUCH BIGGER PROBLEM. It was fucking him to convince the GME board/execs to purchase their stock back‚Ä¶ that‚Äòs where they were about to get raped. 

People here are underestimating the crisis here‚Ä¶ we could see the market crashing 80%‚Ä¶ and having a bear market for multiple years lmao. There were far worse times than 2007-2009 and now (economically) 

Equity premium risk & margin debt at astronomical height, retail not willing to sell and still buying the dip (metrics are weird now, lol) 

Don‚Äòt worry about GME‚Ä¶ there was by for not enough liquidity for them to cover their position, also just take a look at the borrowing rate while AMC is rising. Lmao, there is no mathematical model for setting up a borrowing rate, the clearing will asses/set up the borrowing rate. Stocks that have an lower SI and higher available float have even a higher borrowing fee. Lmao‚Ä¶

GME is weird, one of its kind. 

Btw: if retail pulls it off and Cohen doesn‚Äòt fuck w/ the legal reported short interest‚Ä¶ nothing bad will happen to GameStop after the squeeze. 
So if he squeezes it like Overstock but offers the official short positions to buy themselves back without forcing them to get squeezed (even the legal naked short positions)‚Ä¶ nothing bad will happen.",,

5395,,2021-05-17 12:23:47,t3_neetnp,,wallstreetbets," 

I  have shared my thoughts on UWMC in past. The company announced Q1  earnings and while they look like they are below expectations it was  explained by the CEO that because of the speed of their execution, their  results are reflective of the higher rate environment already while  competitors are lagged.

During    the Q4 2020 earnings call he  had mused about options that would be on    the stable, special dividend,  buyback or raising the dividend.

**Feb Q4 Earnings Quote:**

The     Board did approve a dividend, a $0.10 quarterly dividend to be  paid    on  April 6 for all shareholders of record as of March 10. **We expect  this to be a regular quarterly dividend**.

And     so you guys know how we're thinking about this. Our balance sheet   is  a   fortress. And our current liquidity position is very strong, and    we   have access to the capital markets as well. The way we think  about   this   going forward is we're producing a lot of cash. We're  going to   maybe   be more profitable than some expected and be very  successful in   2021.   And **if we have excess cash that I and the Board deem is too much,  we will be delivering that back**. And whether we have to **change     the  dividend in the future, as in raise it or a special dividend,     those  things are definitely on the table or even buying back shares**.

**May Q1 Earnings Quote:**

As     you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of      $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a      record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I always  **explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special  dividend or a share buyback program**. As you guys have seen, we **concluded      share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward   shareholders.    We announced the authorization of $300 million share   buyback over the    next 24 months**.  And **quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that**.

**Then in answering a question from an analyst**

Doug    Harter -  Great. And then just in terms of capital return, you    mentioned sort of  the float. I  guess just how are you thinking about    kind of **how much of  the float  you'd be willing to take out and pacing around share  repurchase**?

Mat Ishbia -  Yes, Doug. So I'm learning these rules as we go **because at this stock  price, I'm a buyer, right**?    And so we'll buy shares as soon as tomorrow, I  think, as our legal    teams say we're allowed to do. And so I don't know  how many I can buy    and what I can do, but I'm very conscientious of the  float.  If the    float was not a concern, **we'd be more aggressive**. However,  **we     have authorization from the Board to buy up to $300 million, and I'm      going to take advantage of that opportunity while being  conscientious     of our partners in the float.**

TL/DR:     UWMC and their board have been looking at ways to give back to     shareholders. Instead of a short term cash out, they decided on a     buyback that they are planning to exercise immediately on so that they     can retire shares while the SP is low. They will NOT buy so much that   it   will ruin their float % for Russell. The CEO is aggressive, has    approval to spend $300 and he's going to take FULL advantage.  The CEO has stated he is a BUYER! They are  not   waiting, it's being deployed now.

Stochastic's oversold and the RSI is closely following. On a shorter time frame we can see that bulls finished the Friday session off strong positioning us in a nice spot technically as we are sitting on the 20day SMA.

If we can open above 6.9 (50day SMA) I think we can close around that 7.14 (200day SMA) level which should line us up for that move out of the $6-$8 range and into the $10s and beyond.

Now funny enough what actually has me the most bullish this morning is looking at Friday alone. Selling pressure was suppressed by the bulls and it closed right near HOD above all major resistances.

UWMC is ready to pop!

I was in UWMC for the value play. It is a STEAL at 10$ on fundamentals anything below that is an insane deal. Even above 10 has a strong long-term argument.

Here is UWMC in a nutshell: heavily shorted, borrow costs skyrocketing, mortgage industry hit overly hard on fears of rising interest rates, the CEO Ishiba announces a 300M stock buyback, and shorts are QUAKING. UP 6% in premarket following being up 1-2% Friday. This puts at starting at $8 Monday with $9 being a CRITICAL Friday target for us.

All UWMC needs is a little unexpected retail buying pressure and it POPS! In truth this is not just a short squeeze, its multiple plays rolled into one. We have retail buying hype train going (obviously, look at all the WSB posts here posted below), short-squeeze due to high cost of borrow, Gamma squeeze due to the MASSIVE options interest, 300M stock buyback by CEO to scare off the shorts, an unfair post-earnings plunge, plus good-ole\` company doing good things (making money).

We coming back for some of our loyal bagholders that have been holding UWMC since the last train to $14, hey guys remember to take profit this time ;)

It is now cost-prohibitive to use more shorts to keep the price low. The normal dirty tricks triple in price so become less-used. Shorts use this borrow price to determine feasibility and 93% is obviously unfeasible, THEY WILL COVER. Once one group starts covering and causes a spike, other shorts will rush to do the same.

It's a prisoner's dilemma and HF's want to cut each other's throats just as much as ours. Let's let them!!!

Many of these 7.50,9. 10, and 12 are OTM or barely ITM. and an early week spike to put 9c ITM would force MM's to hedge to delta-neutral...further pushing 10c and 12.50 c into hedge territory. This can quickly cause things to spiral out of control for shorts.

Ishbia is going to war with the shorts and his weapon of choice is a 300M stock buyback (similar to RKT's special dividend for the same purpose). The buyback could have started happening as early as May 11th.

Most of the float is owned by institutions and insiders so this buyback puts increased pressure of a heavily shorted (13%+) and heavily held float pool.

Retail is gorging on the float, institutions are holding the float, and Ishbia is buying the free float up. This is a recipe for ROCKET FUEL. WIth shorts paying 93%, they will stop shorting so the shares we are buying are REAL, not synthetic.

Make them buy real shares, from us, at 20$ each.

I am in UWMC for the long-term VALUE-PLAY and like the stock. I like the company., I like the CEO. I like the market position. I like the value. I ilke the stock.

I am loading up on 6/18 8c options. Options are important as we move up to force MM's to buy to remain market neutral.

Options do not pay unless we buy shares, so I suggest splitting half/half to each. options can cause MM's to balance risk and lead to large upswings but this cannot happen without buying pressure and the underlying spiking to necessitate balancing risk, which means we need to buy stocks as well.

Options are good for Gamma Squeeze/MM's balance buys (and profit) but shares are needed to keep the underlying JOOSED and keep those options deep ITM.

5400,,2021-05-17 13:20:55,t3_neg3ey,,wallstreetbets,"$UWMC has become one of the most hyped stocks in the online investment community. Online activity appears to be ramping up after earnings and heading into May 21st option expiries. Since UWM is getting a lot of new eyes, it seemed like an appropriate time to share why some investors may consider UWM as a long term hold. 

UWM is a mortgage company that focuses exclusively on the broker channel. It‚Äôs the largest wholesale mortgage provider in the US and the second largest mortgage originator, behind Rocket Companies. 

It‚Äôs CEO is Mat Ishbia, who started as it‚Äôs 12th employee and who‚Äôs dad, Jeff, started the company as a side hustle. Mat and his brother own 94% of the company in Class D shares. The rest of the public float, \~100m Class A shares, are what is available for the public to purchase. 

# What trends are pushing $UWMC‚Äôs stock down? 

**The largest threat UWM is facing is raising interest rates**: 

About 75% of UWM income is related to refinance activity. The pandemic pushed rates to historic lows so most consumers were better off refinancing. Millions have done that, leading to record profit for mortgage providers like UWM and Rocket. 

**The strength of the broker channel:**

UWM is completely dependent on brokers finding business and closing loans. It doesn‚Äôt have any direct-to-consumer lending operations like Rocket does. 

**Short Interest:** 

Sophisticated investors are seeing 75% of income potentially attached to rate sensitive products (not all refi‚Äôs are rate sensitive like cash out), and are salivating. They think the market is under appreciating this headwind and shorting the stock. They have basically shorted all the shares they can. Friday the stock ended with 200 shares available and an insane 93% borrow rate. 

**SPAC:**

It is true that the SPAC market has softened recently. It is very reasonable to assume $UWMC is a part of that softening. It may not attract institutional investors because of the SPAC situation and the short period it has been publicly traded. Lots of other nice places to put institutional money.

**Competitors:** Mortgages are a mature market and competition is fierce. Rocket, LoanDepot and UWM mentioned a pricing war in their earnings. (LD statement). This will compress loan sale margins in the short term. 

**What trends are pushing $UWMC stock up?** 

**Short term retail pressure:**

there is a lot of retail attention on the potential short squeeze/gamma squeeze you could see this week in UWMC. My post is about UWM‚Äôs long term perspective, so I‚Äôll let [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ndcm0p/uwmc_is_a_powderkeg_low_float_high_short_huge/) take you further down that rabbit hole. Additionally, smart money is now tracking online sentiment, which can lead to increased institutional purchases. 

**Broker Channel Growth:** Mat has claimed two reasons for taking UWM public. He wanted access to the liquidity market and marketing exposure for the broker channel. For UWM to become the largest mortgage originator, Mat has targeted ‚Öì mortgages to be originated by brokers and UWM to own 50% of that channel by 2025/26. Currently UWM owns 36% of the broker channel with brokers originating 20% of all mortgages. Before the housing crisis in 2008, brokers were 58% of mortgage originations (Per Mat & Q1 2021 Earnings call), so it isn‚Äôt crazy to think they could get back to ‚Öì as it is growing: [https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum](https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum)

I had a loan with Rocket and tried to refinance with them. I then went through a mortgage broker and got the same loan for $4.5k cheaper in closing costs. This is because Rocket‚Äôs retail channel has 4% margins and it‚Äôs partnership network (includes wholesale, realtors, etc.) has 1% margins. 

**New Product Offerings:** 

UWM recently released new products like their jumbo loan. In earnings, Mat said he expects $2b in volume from Jumbo. They also added ARM‚Äôs, manufactured homes and expanded government programs. 

**Wholesale mortgage provider consolidation:** 

Mat said 3 of the top 25 wholesale lenders have been purchased in the last 90 days. This type of consolidation happens in mature markets by companies that are reaching for market share. THis could be a sign companies are under pressure to grow but cannot organically get market share from UWM. 

**UWM ‚ÄúAll In‚Äù Ultimatum:** 

Rocket and Fairway are priortizing other channels (cause the margins are so much higher) and trying to squeeze out brokers. UWM said if you work with those two, don‚Äôt work for us. The goal was to stand up for the broker channel WHILE putting some pressure on Rocket and Fairway‚Äôs partnership channel. This may have kickstarted the pricing war. 

**Aggressive Capital returns:** 

UWM pays an annual .40 dividend on its class A shares. That only costs them \~$42m/year. Remember their Q1 net income was $800m+. So their dividends hardly affect the balance sheet. The board just approved a $300/million share buyback as well that will reduce share count. Mat knows a thing or two about shorting stocks. He just sold at $10 and has authority to buy back with the current price under $8. The man successfully shorted his own company. What a legend. 

**Long Term Prediction:** 

I‚Äôm invested in UWM because I believe the capital returns will be aggressive during the upswing and the company will remain profitable in a downturn. With a 5%+ dividend return, share buyback, and \*potentially\* growing market share, UWM could be primed to overtake Rocket within the next few years.

Large social media sites take in a tremendous amount of data each day. This storage must not only be stored, but stored with redundancy as well as backups. Major sites such as Facebook and YouTube keep content that is over a decade old. Over time, the drives holding this content will fail and need to be replaced, leading to growing recurring demand as the size of the platform grows.

The need for storage has been growing for decades, but innovation in storage density and intense competition has limited profitability in the market in the past. That being said, there is reason to believe that the growth in storage density may stop keeping up with the growth in storage needs.

There is also reason to believe that transient growth in storage demand may drive higher Q2 earnings. A new digital currency, Chia, has gobbled up about 6 Exabytes worth of storage in the past 3 weeks, now growing at a rate of about 0.4 EiB per day(and rising). https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/netspace

For reference, about 288 Exabytes worth of hard drives were shipped in Q1 2021 https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hdd-shipments-in-q1-2021

Chia network size can be considered a lagging indicator for unexpected drive shipments. Generally, it can take a few weeks between when a drive is purchased and when it's actually accounted for on the network, as it takes time for it to be shipped, set up, and plotted. Chia wasn't even listed on exchanges until a couple weeks ago, so most of the growth seen is prior to Chia even having a price. At current prices, mining is incredibly profitable, with a $500 14 TB drive estimated to produce about $26 per day, and using very little power. So even if the network grows 10x to 60 Exabytes, it's still producing $3/day at current prices. So expect the surge in demand to continue.

I have seen many anecdotes of drive shortages over the past couple weeks. Reviewing sites like Amazon, I have also seen high capacity drives go out of stock or require lead times of a few weeks.

This may be a bit reminiscent of GPU shortages among Nvidia and AMD as miners seek to buy up anything they can.

If we project continued growth at 0.4 Exabytes a day in unexpected demand from proof of storage over the next 40 days, plus the 6 Exabytes added since April 20(leaving out first 3 weeks in quarter as they were likely logged last quarter), that's about 22 Exabytes to be added in Q2 that are not part of normal usage, or about an extra ~8% of Q1 demand.

What's perhaps most interesting is the impact this could have on margins. Unlike the GPUs used to mine which are consumer devices, the devices used for mining Chia includes enterprise grade hardware. Prices in the drive market are more flexible at the manufacturer level, and currently have much lower margins. If proof of storage currencies cause a drive shortage, it could have a significant impact on margins. Western digital sells about 40% of its drives through distributors, Seagate about 30%. Sales through these channels generally are very responsive to demand trends in terms of prices.

Seagate is also in a position to profit from this, but I'm a bit more worried about them as hard drive shipments have been on a long term decline and they aren't diversified into SSDs/flash like Western Digital is.

The EMA (EU medical agency like FDA) announced Myovant and Relugolix as up for review to be accepted for Marketing approval in the EU this week. This is a huge catalyst in the biotech industry, and due to their Pfizer partnership this could result in a 50m cash payment to Myovant as well.

They also have an FDA PDUFA deadline of June 1 for a second application (their first of three was approved in December). If approved this would result in a 100m cash payment from Pfizer.

Alone, these are major catalysts. Right now they stand to go back to back on these catalysts. The last time the company had one catalyst like this, **they were rocketed past $30 a share and gained a strategic partnership from Pfizer.**

Now those are two major catalysts within two weeks, **if FDA decides early, both could happen this week.**

Due to the triple threat data put up in clinical trials and the fact that they had this data peer reviewed and published in the New England journal of medicine, there is strong confidence of approval on the company‚Äôs end.

Last but not least, they have additional catalysts still inbound after. Including Part D and Medicare coverage expected by July 1. All encompassed with a possible buyout from sumitomo.

If you're looking for a good article that covers the basics, you can search the below. Theres also some great posts on reddit and stock twits. I am also happy to answer any questions.

**Quick list of upcoming catalysts:**

By June 1: Deadline for FDA approval for a second use case (this could come early and will result in another 100m cash payment from Pfizer)

By July 1: Part d and Medicare coverage: also supposed to be obtained before July 1 for prostate cancer application

Pfizer optionality: Pfizer can opt in to have the rights to sell this in some markets, resulting in a 50m cash payment and royalties paid to myovant. Submission of relugolix for the treatment of endometriosis to the FDA

Catalysts that could happen at any time:  **BUYOUT** from Sumitomo ( aka Sumitovant) or other interested partner (See Urovant history. Sumi has a patent cliff in 2023 they are trying to patch with acquisitions, has purchased 4 of movants sister companies and already owns 53.5% of myovant).

It sounds like an impossibility, but there are simple ways to reading a price chart that enable you to come very close to predicting the direction and turning points of a stock. One of the most important ways is through the identification and marking of channel line patterns.

&#x200B;

[ Prices respect the channel lines ](https://preview.redd.it/fqzpk486qpz61.png?width=1067&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5b02809e77b0f9d4f8162cd558a98154a5aad8e)

Channels lines are one of the most important patterns found on a price chart. They enable you to find the broader trend, or overall direction prices are heading, which is crucial towards choosing the direction of your trade. Sticking with the trend - going long on an uptrend and short on a downtrend - aligns you with the higher probability direction, already setting yourself up for a probable trade.

They also enable you to anticipate and profit from areas where the price has a high likelihood of reversing through a ""bounce"" - where prices hit an upper or lower side of the channel and bounce off of the level like a ball, and heading into the opposite direction. These are key areas because unlike a random point in the chart, a channel line presents a point that has a higher probability of doing one thing over another - *this is an example of where ""edge"" comes from - finding scenarios where one outcome is more likely than the other, and betting on it.*

&#x200B;

[ Channel line pattern with bounces circled ](https://preview.redd.it/f0l668a7qpz61.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=658f753348044acec2cceeaa1dfbf4c6288ae0ff)

## How do you define a channel pattern?

A channel line pattern exists when prices are moving between two parallel trendlines. A trendline is a straight line drawn to connect several major turning points, or swings, in the price chart. When there are two identifiable trendlines that are parallel to each other forming a straight band, prices are *trading within a channel*.

&#x200B;

[ A trendline drawn off of the highs ](https://preview.redd.it/fcfpptc8qpz61.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc81911e78d6e9ee5012760fc53e05f6200513b2)

Trendlines and channels are drawings that highlight the foundational concept of understanding price charts - support and resistance. Support is a level that lies underneath the current price that historically has acted as a cushion for prices, slowing their momentum or causing them to turn right around. Resistance is a level that lies above the current price that historically has acted as a barrier for prices, slowing their momentum or causing a reversal. In this way, support and resistance are one and the same - they are levels that ""support"" or ""resist"", keeping prices within their confines until they lose their power.

&#x200B;

>Prices will often ""test"" support and resistance multiple times and the level will successfully hold, creating areas with a high probability of a bounce - therefore creating trading opportunities.

## How to Draw Channel Lines

So, trendlines connect two or more support or resistance zones, which are areas where prices reversed or showed slowing momentum. Channels are two parallel trendlines. With that, *how can you draw a channel line on a price chart*?

The first consideration is if there is a channel at all. Often, there are ample opportunities to draw trendlines - straight lines connecting s/r. However, it is less often that the chart shows another parallel trendline that price has interacted with. Thus, a textbook ""channel"" with prices neatly filling in the space and bouncing off of the lines is not as easy as it seems to find - **this actually makes the pattern more important, as the discovery of a true channel pattern can lead to very clean bounces and high probability, low risk trades.**

To draw a channel, first find a trendline. Connect important swing lows or highs, and try to find a way to draw a line that connects two or more of the swings, while keeping all of of the other price movement between the swings above the line.

&#x200B;

[ First trendline duplicated and dragged to mark swing lows ](https://preview.redd.it/ss3uggaaqpz61.png?width=561&format=png&auto=webp&s=56e6198235392485a05edaddc3f8d0da4d802d4c)

>A trendline is only as significant as the prices' respect for it - there is no validity to drawing a trendline that connects two swings, while is broken by three other spikes.

Once you've found the trendline, either duplicate the trendline you have just drawn, or if using a channel drawing tool, simply drag the parallel line to see if it can connect two more swings on the opposite side of the price movement.

It takes *a lot* of practice to begin to properly draw channel lines that are valid and are respected by prices. Drawing channel patterns that match historical price charts is hard - and drawing them in a way that can successfully anticipate *future* price movements is even more of a learned skill. This can only be improved by practicing drawing channels on many different charts.

## Types of Channel Lines

The direction of channel lines determine the type of channel pattern. A channel pointed at an upward sloping angle signals an uptrend. A channel pointed at a downward angle signals a downtrend. A channel with a horizontal slope signals a range.

&#x200B;

[ Uptrend ](https://preview.redd.it/s8h4o1xbqpz61.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=1df032e442d4dddf112e30748baedcff16656291)

A concept that is helpful in the identification of a channel's direction is the presence of swing highs and lows. If prices are making higher swings high (peaks) and higher swings low (troughs), chances are they are in an uptrend. If prices are making lower highs and lower lows, they are likely in a downtrend. If there are equal or mismatching swing lows and highs, and prices look more horizontal, a range is likely in play.

&#x200B;

[ Downtrend with channel break ](https://preview.redd.it/wovf3mvcqpz61.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0029bb3d64ea2cb1da1b122a2e477cd0ce827d)

In a trending market, sticking with the direction of the trend can put you on the higher probability side. Combined with an entry identified by the channel lines, this can form the basis of a trading strategy.

In a ranging market, where prices are simply bouncing between two horizontal support and resistance trendlines, any time prices approach or touch the channel lines can be a significant reversal area, where there is a higher probability of a bounce than a breakout through the line.

&#x200B;

[Range](https://preview.redd.it/6z1kj65eqpz61.png?width=1019&format=png&auto=webp&s=3196922b3ddd01cd806ca9f100aa01918bf0b766)

## The Midline and Channel Pattern Breaks

Many channel drawing tools can display a midline, or a line 50% away from both trendlines. This line can serve as an important secondary trendline or support/resistance zone, and often prices react to the midline in a less apparent, but still significant way. Additionally, sometimes prices will break the channel line and form a new high outside of the channel. When this happens, the broken trendline can sometimes become the midline of a wider channel that incorporates the new swing.

&#x200B;

[ Upper channel line turned into midline after breakout ](https://preview.redd.it/wz5gw1peqpz61.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=68d55d124e5799ccc86ac01d5f860786ef24d183)

*When prices break a channel line, it is a sign that the pattern is losing validity.* The trend may be losing steam or accelerating, based on if it breaks the lower or the upper line. A channel line pattern is most valid when there are no price breaks of the trendlines. When prices break the countertrend side (the lower line in an uptrend or the upper line in a downtrend), you can anticipate a reversal soon. When prices break the with-trend side, the trend has accelerated, and you may need to redraw your channel line. This can also be seen as an expenditure of momentum which can bring a trend channel back into a range or a reversal.

## How to Trade With Channel Lines

Because channel line patterns offer areas that have *a higher probability of moving in one direction over the other*, trading strategies can be formed around the pattern. After identifying a valid channel, a strategy may look to buy or sell as price touches the with-trend channel line, setting a stop loss level based on volatility, Fibonacci extensions, or a selection of indicators that can identify momentum and turning points. A take profit level could be determined by a significant support/resistance level, Fibonacci retracements, or indicators similar to those used in stop placement.

&#x200B;

[ A channel bounce trade with \>2:1 risk:reward ](https://preview.redd.it/f24xyxqfqpz61.png?width=1521&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae05a98cdfdfcfb19552fbff3bbb2b5b4331ba7a)

The key advantage to trading channel bounces is the **high risk to reward** offered. A tight stop loss can allow for a high R:R ratio even with a high probability, modest profit target level. Thus, the strategy utilizes *a high probability turning point, a tight stop loss, and a modest profit target* which culminates into a trading plan with a healthy win rate and risk to reward ratio.

Finally, an overlooked aspect of using channels:

This helps to reinforce a golden rule of trading - only look to enter trades when there is a higher probability of one thing happening over the other. By watching your channel lines, you'll know when it's there.

5416,,2021-05-17 17:38:52,t3_nemlpe,,wallstreetbets,"So right now, the mainstream narrative is that inflation is going to run red hot mostly due to a rally in commodity prices. This inflation has the potential to be more than transitory, meaning it lasts more than a couple of quarters at most and will result in forcing the FED to raise rates and crash growth stocks. This is why tech stocks are underperforming while value, or more specifically, manufacturing and mining companies outperform (look at XME for example).

My question is if that is the case, then why are steel futures for U.S. Midwest Domestic Hot-Rolled Coil Steel going down [CME Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/ferrous/hrc-steel_quotes_globex.html)? Right now they peak in June at $1,520 a tonne before steadily going down for the foreseeable future.

Similar things can be said about other commodities such as copper, which remains relatively steady before gradually going down going into next year [Copper Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/base/copper_quotes_globex.html).

On the agriculture side, major commodities like corn appear to be peaking in the near future as well [Corn Futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/grain-and-oilseed/corn_quotes_globex.html).

So taking all of this into account, it would appear that the shape of the futures curves would indicate that commodity prices would peak in near future before gradually going down as supply meets demand. Shouldn't this mean that inflation is indeed transitory as the FED predicts? What am I missing here?

**Tl;Dr:** Futures are showing commodity prices going down in the near future which should drag down inflation rates. Are inflation fears misplaced?",nemlpe,Are Commodity Futures Going Against The Mainstream Inflation Narrative?

Their software monitors user activity to automate repetitive front and back office tasks, including those performed using other business software such as customer relationship management or enterprise resource planning software.

In April 2020, UiPath was named the top tech company and #2 overall in the Financial Times FT1000 ranking of Americas' fastest growing companies 2020[https://www.ft.com/americas-fastest-growing-companies-2020]. In June, UiPath was named to the CNBC 2020 Disruptor 50 ranking [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/16/uipath-disruptor-50.html]. In September, UiPath was ranked #3 on the Forbes Cloud 100 list for the second consecutive year[https://www.forbes.com/consent/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/cloud100/#37c358225f94]



Last month $path went public with only 23million shares as IPO. In addition, UiPath has granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 3,583,616. All together that's less than 25 million shares. 


ARK already snapped 6.4 million shares of path. Minus the ARK's shares, there are less than 19 million shares available. Any bulk call buying can trigger a huge run on shares as just 190k call contracts would require option sellers to buy every single available share from the market (incase they didn't cover their calls yet) .

It's no secret that companies hire teams of people to brainstorm, draft, and send tweets, but even with the millions of dollars spent on this process it is rare for corporate twitter accounts to have big spikes in followers. Wendy's can obviously tweet some witty stuff that will get lots of likes and retweets, but this usually doesn't motivate most people to sign up for extra ads on their timeline by actually following these accounts.

Wingstop, however, cracked the code on Wednesday by denying the presence of ejaculate in their special white sauce. On Wednesday, one customer tweeted ""wingstop ranch gotta have nut in it no way it‚Äôs just that good"" to which Wingstop replied ""it's a special white sauce but it does not contain \[nut\]""

The rest of the conversation did not contain any more trade secrets on the Wingstop recipe, but it was notable in its own way.

I rarely ever see companies with hundreds of thousands of followers (Wingstop has over 200k) receive over a 5% increase in Twitter followers over a week. Wingstop had a 10% gain in a matter of days.

5444,,2021-05-17 21:46:48,t3_nesw0u,,wallstreetbets,"Hey Guys, it's me again. I think you guys may remember me, after all I wrote an extensive series of DD over a month on UWMC through its trials and tribulations, in anticipation of it's breakout moment. You might even remember my YOLO, and remembered I continuously added to it. And that I eventually upped my margin to 13.5k on it. Well, I'm here to tell you that I'm not out. I bought more calls to average down, on earnings day, and I held them when they tanked to ten cents a pop. My only regret is that I didn't buy more then. Though I threw a bit more cash into shares!

Back then, I said the Theta Beta's would regret selling those calls, and it was one of the few plays where there wouldn't be IV Crush. I was right. Their probably a little sour. Sorry chaps, you usually are the one's making money at our expense. This time it's going to have to be the other way around....

Today, I had the chance to exit my options for a 47% profit roughly. Sell calls for a chunky profit after that. I said no. You know why? Because fuck the people who shorted an extremely profitable company to 6.26 dollars, that's why. The Fear, the Uncertainty, and the Doubt people expressed to me regarding this company espoused to me because of the actions of those people gave me an aneurysm. So fuck them. We're playing Pac Man people. The CEO of UWMC is reducing the float, and increasing the percentage of the float that is sold short while increasing buying pressure. We're buying up the stock to get the price to 9-10 because people bought options for 5-10 cents and they'll be in the money quite easily. And because of the rising volume, every day the CEO is able to buy more and more shares thanks to Rule 10B. The delta on the options is low, and they will need to hedge as the price heads steadily upward on Friday. Then the Shorts are going to be squeezed even further as the market makers hedge.

So no, I won't sell my options for a 10 or a 50% profit. I'm going to sell my options at a price I damn well want to. One that compensates me for the trouble that these people have given me. And so should you.

I understand people have taken profits, but honestly, at the price point they were selling at the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. Good for them though. Next time, could you at least sell deep ITM covered calls though lmao.

And for those people on the fucking fence. You jumped onto MVIS, you jumped into GME, and AMC, and all manners of companies that are either unprofitable or make very little money. But the fucking BOOMER stock is where you hesitate the fence?! The fucking (Eyy Lmaooo) Boomer stock, giving you a 4.87% dividend? The one that, if you somehow baghold can give you 10-15% cash returns through divitendies and covered calls until you get assigned at a strike that is profitable to you? The 10-15% backboard cash that can fund all your yolo's? That's the fucking stock you hesitate on? El LMAO. The companies margins will expand hard in a few months, and it's still hugely profitable at a less than 1 percent margin so yeah. Now if you were buying at 14 fucking bucks, you're a dumb ape, but yeah.

I'm fucking going to ride my options to a fucking profit margin that compensates me for the shit they pulled, or to a GUH. No in between. The Stock Buyback middle finger is just the fucking sweetener.

Matt Daddy, and I, and all the people who everyone called bag holders are going to skull fuck the shorters harder than they skull fucked UWMC's share price. They're going to fucking Guh their way into a fucking shoebox. Fuck em. I want me tendies well cooked, a side of fries, and a foot massage. And their going to give it to me.

They did it with blockbuster but they were more vocal about it, and in turn their stock price plummeted for 4 years because the people found out what they did after they went under and hiked prices by 60%. *but that was soon forgotten*

\-Netflix still has a mail out service, it would be lucrative if they put GME out of business and take over

\- It would be great if Netflix could take over in person movie theaters..

The two stocks that they projected would gain the most are listed below. 
- FuelCell Energy (FCEL) 
- iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN) 
These two are predicted to skyrocket under the Biden administration due to his push for renewable energy, especially if the Green New Deal is passed.

5453,,2021-05-18 01:34:15,t3_nexq9s,,wallstreetbets,"I don't normally play meme stocks - but I thought the GME technical setup was especially intriguing recently.

[GME TA](https://preview.redd.it/1tmj448o6sz61.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=1de6593bb253ff2a102250d3e4a97d521e0b3455)

The setup is a symmetrical triangle. Normally when continuation patterns come from downside - they have a bearish bias. However - we broke that red trendline  with an uptick in volume - this was a hint we were ready for an actual reversal. That trendline kept us in a downtrend for about 4 months. Not only that but...

**TODAY WE BROKE THE SYMMETRICAL TRIANGLE UP - WHICH MEANS ITS FULL SPEED AHEAD!**

Confluence between technicals generate the best signals.

This is the best the setup has looked since GME was at 10. Price target for this is 231.52 resistance initially, followed by 348.50. Breakout is invalid and play is dead if we get a daily close back under 158.11.

And... that's it.

I've been trading for a long time and only use patterns, trendlines & volume. Keep it simple. You don't need to waste 100 hours doing 15 paragraphs of DD for one swing trade - or look at 100 different indicators cherry picking the ones that say your position will go up.

***TL;DR*** \- GME actually looks good for once from an **unbiased** technical standpoint

***EDIT:*** Clarification - I wasn't speaking for GME as a whole when I said it was dead under 158.11 - I simply meant this setup in particular was no longer valid. It could always form a new one. I chose that level because it's the most significant one below the breakout point.",nexq9s,$GME TA - BIG BREAKOUT TODAY - SETUP LOOKS BETTER THAN IT EVER HAS

This post isn't intended to draw away from that, just an opportunity that I see and would like to share. This play is based on $AMCs undoubtable liftoff to $30+.

AMC READY TO FLY.

Plenty of DD has been done on AMC and why its going to take off - I'm not here to talk about that. It is coiled, has popped, and is ready to rip a new butthole in the sky.

$CNK is AMCs largest competitor and is in the great business we know as movie theaters. When AMC last went crazy, CNK ran up over 56% in a few days from 22-27 of January to $27+. In the past month, AMC is up over 50%. CNK is roughly even. It is lagging behind and is due for a major pop on this AMC craze. It is a classically more boring stock that takes a big nudge to move.

Breaking out similar to AMC. Insanely strong volume shelf in low 20s (high demand) and above 1D 21MA. RSI has lots of room to run. 

**MARGIN**

CNK has a much lower implied volatility and actually allows for margin borrowing. This could be attractive depending on your risk appetite

**DILUTION/FINANCIALS**

CNK has almost no share dilution since the pandemic started, and it has been historically stronger than AMC from a traditional (retarded) financial perspective. AMCs market value growth has passed CNKs by many multiples over the past year. No reason she can't get some love.

Don't overthink it. We love this guy. Fuck you and lets make some money:

His $TSLA puts are generating the most interest from the media, but the position that stuck out most to me is his puts on $TLT, the 20-year treasury bond etf. It makes sense, if inflation really is upon us, the fed will have to raise rates soon. Higher rates = lower price per bond = lower $TLT. This seems way too intuitive and I feel like an idiot for not thinking of it a month ago, but obviously that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not Dr. Burry. I‚Äôm sure he got in a while ago and is already up a bunch of money, but I feel like there are still gains to be made in this trade in the months ahead.

The reason I‚Äôm posting is that $TLT has already come down a fair amount in the past month, but this still seems like an easy money play on inflation. Is there something I‚Äôm missing or is it really that simple? The 13F for Scion Asset Management doesn‚Äôt detail the strike price or expiration for the puts, but I‚Äôm thinking about going in for a few 1/21/22 $125 puts on $TLT. The fed claims this inflation is transitory, but I don‚Äôt think anyone on the street buys it. I think rates have to come up at least a little bit sometime between now and next January.

Glacier Capital exists. That sentence isn't going to make me any friends, but your wallet needs to hear it. They've even written some insightful pieces which panned out as per the analyses; CVNA (link below) performed well in the short-term as predicted, but the majority shareholder and CEO sold practically all of his shares four days ago, al in line with their poor long-term outlook.

A lot of the theorising focuses on the founding year of the company. Look... the profile on Bloomberg is for a different Glacier Capital LLC. There appear to be quite a few Glacier Capital LLCs. In the US, LLC names are not unique on a federal level. Unrelated companies in different states can have exactly the same name.

When we consider that the CEO of *the* Glacier Capital was still a university student in 2005, we can safely conclude this isn't a smoking gun and it's likely we're tripping up over unrelated companies.

Look at the dates. When the whole GME surge was first kicking off, Glacier Capital filed to register for a 'Legal Entity Identifier' (LEI) in order to comply with 'Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II' (MiFID II), which was a tightening of regulations within the EU in 2008. LEIs are required in order to comply with MiFID II, and MiFID II needs to be complied with in order to carry out certain high risk activities, including forms/scales of derivatives.

I am not a European financial services lawyer but considering the timing of everything, it seems reasonable to assume that the short positions may be real - and if new certs were put in place just for one series of positions, then it isn't crazy to think they might be especially large.

Again, *I am not saying* that this isn't an incestuous industry or that the capital isn't coming from known players. I am specifically begging you not to be a fucking dumbfuck because of one Reddit-cum-Sherlock post so that whatever dumbass decision you make next is at least a little less erratic.

1.**The Fed will cap yields and do whatever it takes to support the economy and markets‚Äîi.e., much more dollar printing.**

**Let me dig in !**

The recent NFIB survey suggests we are only in an economic recovery, not an expansion.

NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *‚Äúactually‚Äù* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *‚Äúdemand‚Äù* meets its operating cash flows.

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

&#x200B;

Businesses understand that the stimulus [***‚Äúpulled forward‚Äù***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)

much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***‚Äúcosts‚Äù*** **of** ***‚Äúlong-term employment‚Äù*** **for a** ***‚Äúshort-term‚Äù*** **artificial economic boost.**

The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.**¬†Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive. Therefore **Fed will cap yields and do whatever it takes to support the economy , employment and markets.**

At the risk of repeating myself, the risk to the upside in the 30-Year yield is capped somewhere between 2.75-3.00%,

We finally got ‚Äúofficial‚Äù confirmation in May that inflation has already begun to take off:

The headline CPI year-over-year increase at 4.2% was the highest since 2008. Energy prices rose 25% and gas prices 50%. Rising energy prices filter through to almost everything. Used car and truck prices were up 21%. Rents rose 2.1%. If you substitute home prices for rents, that number more than doubled.

&#x200B;

 On top of all that, the CPI is widely understood to dramatically understate inflation, so the increases are much worse than the headline numbers. As I like to say, one just has to look at the performance of commodity futures over the past year, or go to Home Depot or the grocery store. It‚Äôs not rocket science. This will continue until the monetary and fiscal stimulus stops, small and medium-sized businesses return, and employment rises significantly. Don‚Äôt hold your breath, 

&#x200B;

The month-over-month increases were far higher than expected, double in the case of the headline PPI. These are the prices that filter through to consumer prices over time‚Äîi.e., the CPI is likely going even higher.¬†

If that were not enough, wage inflation is on the rise, too, as employers struggle to get people off the couch who can otherwise live on their stimulus checks. Checks that are unlikely to be inflation indexed. Several States have already begun or are considering a ‚Äúreturn to work bonus‚Äù in order to get people to go back to work.

""Therefore I assume inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside .""

Conclusion and Goals :

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

The scenario to play out in weeks in precious Metals ;

 

Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and Gold and the metals soar.Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields.I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks.

Gold & silver's monthly defined 2021 road map still intact. Q2 and Q4 belong to silver, while gold will shine in Q3. For Silver q2 /2021 my targets are 42 Usd /ozz while gold 1.900 Usd/ozz .

The last time I checked for AMC, the short interest was around 16% but like I said, there is lots of ways that short interest can be disguised so it may well be much larger.

I  have shared my thoughts on UWMC in past. The company announced Q1  earnings and while they look like they are below expectations it was  explained by the CEO that because of the speed of their execution, their  results are reflective of the higher rate environment already while  competitors are lagged.

During    the Q4 2020 earnings call he  had mused about options that would be on    the stable, special dividend,  buyback or raising the dividend.

**Feb Q4 Earnings Quote:**

The     Board did approve a dividend, a $0.10 quarterly dividend to be  paid    on  April 6 for all shareholders of record as of March 10. **We expect  this to be a regular quarterly dividend**.

And     so you guys know how we're thinking about this. Our balance sheet   is  a   fortress. And our current liquidity position is very strong, and    we   have access to the capital markets as well. The way we think  about   this   going forward is we're producing a lot of cash. We're  going to   maybe   be more profitable than some expected and be very  successful in   2021.   And **if we have excess cash that I and the Board deem is too much,  we will be delivering that back**. And whether we have to **change     the  dividend in the future, as in raise it or a special dividend,     those  things are definitely on the table or even buying back shares**.

**May Q1 Earnings Quote:**

As     you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of      $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a      record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I always  **explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special  dividend or a share buyback program**. As you guys have seen, we **concluded      share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward   shareholders.    We announced the authorization of $300 million share   buyback over the    next 24 months**.  And **quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that**.

**Then in answering a question from an analyst**

Doug    Harter -  Great. And then just in terms of capital return, you    mentioned sort of  the float. I  guess just how are you thinking about    kind of **how much of  the float  you'd be willing to take out and pacing around share  repurchase**?

Mat Ishbia -  Yes, Doug. So I'm learning these rules as we go **because at this stock  price, I'm a buyer, right**?    And so we'll buy shares as soon as tomorrow, I  think, as our legal    teams say we're allowed to do. And so I don't know  how many I can buy    and what I can do, but I'm very conscientious of the  float.  If the    float was not a concern, **we'd be more aggressive**. However,  **we     have authorization from the Board to buy up to $300 million, and I'm      going to take advantage of that opportunity while being  conscientious     of our partners in the float.**

TL/DR:     UWMC and their board have been looking at ways to give back to     shareholders. Instead of a short term cash out, they decided on a     buyback that they are planning to exercise immediately on so that they     can retire shares while the SP is low. They will NOT buy so much that   it   will ruin their float % for Russell. The CEO is aggressive, has    approval to spend $300 and he's going to take FULL advantage.  The CEO has stated he is a BUYER! They are  not   waiting, it's being deployed now.

If we can open above 6.9 (50day SMA) I think we can close around that 7.14 (200day SMA) level which should line us up for that move out of the $6-$8 range and into the $10s and beyond.

UWMC is ready to pop!

I was in UWMC for the value play. It is a STEAL at 10$ on fundamentals anything below that is an insane deal. Even above 10 has a strong long-term argument.

Here is UWMC in a nutshell: heavily shorted, borrow costs skyrocketing, mortgage industry hit overly hard on fears of rising interest rates, the CEO Ishiba announces a 300M stock buyback, and shorts are QUAKING. UP 6% in premarket following being up 1-2% Friday. This puts at starting at $8 Monday with $9 being a CRITICAL Friday target for us.

All UWMC needs is a little unexpected retail buying pressure and it POPS! In truth this is not just a short squeeze, its multiple plays rolled into one. We have retail buying hype train going (obviously, look at all the WSB posts here posted below), short-squeeze due to high cost of borrow, Gamma squeeze due to the MASSIVE options interest, 300M stock buyback by CEO to scare off the shorts, an unfair post-earnings plunge, plus good-ole\` company doing good things (making money).

We coming back for some of our loyal bagholders that have been holding UWMC since the last train to $14, hey guys remember to take profit this time ;)

It is now cost-prohibitive to use more shorts to keep the price low. The normal dirty tricks triple in price so become less-used. Shorts use this borrow price to determine feasibility and 93% is obviously unfeasible, THEY WILL COVER. Once one group starts covering and causes a spike, other shorts will rush to do the same.

It's a prisoner's dilemma and HF's want to cut each other's throats just as much as ours. Let's let them!!!

Many of these 7.50,9. 10, and 12 are OTM or barely ITM. and an early week spike to put 9c ITM would force MM's to hedge to delta-neutral...further pushing 10c and 12.50 c into hedge territory. This can quickly cause things to spiral out of control for shorts.

Stock BuyBack,

Ishbia is going to war with the shorts and his weapon of choice is a 300M stock buyback (similar to RKT's special dividend for the same purpose). The buyback could have started happening as early as May 11th.

Most of the float is owned by institutions and insiders so this buyback puts increased pressure of a heavily shorted (13%+) and heavily held float pool.

Retail is gorging on the float, institutions are holding the float, and Ishbia is buying the free float up. This is a recipe for ROCKET FUEL. WIth shorts paying 93%, they will stop shorting so the shares we are buying are REAL, not synthetic.

Make them buy real shares, from us, at 20$ each.

I am in UWMC for the long-term VALUE-PLAY and like the stock. I like the company., I like the CEO. I like the market position. I like the value. I ilke the stock.

I am loading up on 6/18 8c options. Options are important as we move up to force MM's to buy to remain market neutral.

Options do not pay unless we buy shares, so I suggest splitting half/half to each. options can cause MM's to balance risk and lead to large upswings but this cannot happen without buying pressure and the underlying spiking to necessitate balancing risk, which means we need to buy stocks as well.

Options are good for Gamma Squeeze/MM's balance buys (and profit) but shares are needed to keep the underlying JOOSED and keep those options deep ITM.

MIX IT UP!

This is the final call for the UWMC tendie train so get your fucking tickets and remember; Gravy costs extra,

5857,,2021-05-17 13:20:55,t3_neg3ey,,wallstreetbets,"$UWMC has become one of the most hyped stocks in the online investment community. Online activity appears to be ramping up after earnings and heading into May 21st option expiries. Since UWM is getting a lot of new eyes, it seemed like an appropriate time to share why some investors may consider UWM as a long term hold. 

UWM is a mortgage company that focuses exclusively on the broker channel. It‚Äôs the largest wholesale mortgage provider in the US and the second largest mortgage originator, behind Rocket Companies. 

It‚Äôs CEO is Mat Ishbia, who started as it‚Äôs 12th employee and who‚Äôs dad, Jeff, started the company as a side hustle. Mat and his brother own 94% of the company in Class D shares. The rest of the public float, \~100m Class A shares, are what is available for the public to purchase. 

# What trends are pushing $UWMC‚Äôs stock down? 

**The largest threat UWM is facing is raising interest rates**: 

About 75% of UWM income is related to refinance activity. The pandemic pushed rates to historic lows so most consumers were better off refinancing. Millions have done that, leading to record profit for mortgage providers like UWM and Rocket. 

**The strength of the broker channel:**

UWM is completely dependent on brokers finding business and closing loans. It doesn‚Äôt have any direct-to-consumer lending operations like Rocket does. 

**Short Interest:** 

Sophisticated investors are seeing 75% of income potentially attached to rate sensitive products (not all refi‚Äôs are rate sensitive like cash out), and are salivating. They think the market is under appreciating this headwind and shorting the stock. They have basically shorted all the shares they can. Friday the stock ended with 200 shares available and an insane 93% borrow rate. 

**SPAC:**

It is true that the SPAC market has softened recently. It is very reasonable to assume $UWMC is a part of that softening. It may not attract institutional investors because of the SPAC situation and the short period it has been publicly traded. Lots of other nice places to put institutional money.

**Competitors:** Mortgages are a mature market and competition is fierce. Rocket, LoanDepot and UWM mentioned a pricing war in their earnings. (LD statement). This will compress loan sale margins in the short term. 

**What trends are pushing $UWMC stock up?** 

**Short term retail pressure:**

there is a lot of retail attention on the potential short squeeze/gamma squeeze you could see this week in UWMC. My post is about UWM‚Äôs long term perspective, so I‚Äôll let [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ndcm0p/uwmc_is_a_powderkeg_low_float_high_short_huge/) take you further down that rabbit hole. Additionally, smart money is now tracking online sentiment, which can lead to increased institutional purchases. 

**Broker Channel Growth:** Mat has claimed two reasons for taking UWM public. He wanted access to the liquidity market and marketing exposure for the broker channel. For UWM to become the largest mortgage originator, Mat has targeted ‚Öì mortgages to be originated by brokers and UWM to own 50% of that channel by 2025/26. Currently UWM owns 36% of the broker channel with brokers originating 20% of all mortgages. Before the housing crisis in 2008, brokers were 58% of mortgage originations (Per Mat & Q1 2021 Earnings call), so it isn‚Äôt crazy to think they could get back to ‚Öì as it is growing: [https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum](https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum)

I had a loan with Rocket and tried to refinance with them. I then went through a mortgage broker and got the same loan for $4.5k cheaper in closing costs. This is because Rocket‚Äôs retail channel has 4% margins and it‚Äôs partnership network (includes wholesale, realtors, etc.) has 1% margins. 

**New Product Offerings:** 

UWM recently released new products like their jumbo loan. In earnings, Mat said he expects $2b in volume from Jumbo. They also added ARM‚Äôs, manufactured homes and expanded government programs. 

**Wholesale mortgage provider consolidation:** 

Mat said 3 of the top 25 wholesale lenders have been purchased in the last 90 days. This type of consolidation happens in mature markets by companies that are reaching for market share. THis could be a sign companies are under pressure to grow but cannot organically get market share from UWM. 

**UWM ‚ÄúAll In‚Äù Ultimatum:** 

Rocket and Fairway are priortizing other channels (cause the margins are so much higher) and trying to squeeze out brokers. UWM said if you work with those two, don‚Äôt work for us. The goal was to stand up for the broker channel WHILE putting some pressure on Rocket and Fairway‚Äôs partnership channel. This may have kickstarted the pricing war. 

**Aggressive Capital returns:** 

UWM pays an annual .40 dividend on its class A shares. That only costs them \~$42m/year. Remember their Q1 net income was $800m+. So their dividends hardly affect the balance sheet. The board just approved a $300/million share buyback as well that will reduce share count. Mat knows a thing or two about shorting stocks. He just sold at $10 and has authority to buy back with the current price under $8. The man successfully shorted his own company. What a legend. 

**Long Term Prediction:** 

I‚Äôm invested in UWM because I believe the capital returns will be aggressive during the upswing and the company will remain profitable in a downturn. With a 5%+ dividend return, share buyback, and \*potentially\* growing market share, UWM could be primed to overtake Rocket within the next few years.

5861,,2021-05-17 14:45:52,t3_nei5qk,,wallstreetbets,"As the cloud & big data continues to grow, as well as social media & 4k/8k video, data storage is becoming more important than ever.

Large social media sites take in a tremendous amount of data each day. This storage must not only be stored, but stored with redundancy as well as backups. Major sites such as Facebook and YouTube keep content that is over a decade old. Over time, the drives holding this content will fail and need to be replaced, leading to growing recurring demand as the size of the platform grows.

The need for storage has been growing for decades, but innovation in storage density and intense competition has limited profitability in the market in the past. That being said, there is reason to believe that the growth in storage density may stop keeping up with the growth in storage needs.

There is also reason to believe that transient growth in storage demand may drive higher Q2 earnings. A new digital currency, Chia, has gobbled up about 6 Exabytes worth of storage in the past 3 weeks, now growing at a rate of about 0.4 EiB per day(and rising). https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/netspace

For reference, about 288 Exabytes worth of hard drives were shipped in Q1 2021 https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hdd-shipments-in-q1-2021

Chia network size can be considered a lagging indicator for unexpected drive shipments. Generally, it can take a few weeks between when a drive is purchased and when it's actually accounted for on the network, as it takes time for it to be shipped, set up, and plotted. Chia wasn't even listed on exchanges until a couple weeks ago, so most of the growth seen is prior to Chia even having a price. At current prices, mining is incredibly profitable, with a $500 14 TB drive estimated to produce about $26 per day, and using very little power. So even if the network grows 10x to 60 Exabytes, it's still producing $3/day at current prices. So expect the surge in demand to continue.

I have seen many anecdotes of drive shortages over the past couple weeks. Reviewing sites like Amazon, I have also seen high capacity drives go out of stock or require lead times of a few weeks.

This may be a bit reminiscent of GPU shortages among Nvidia and AMD as miners seek to buy up anything they can.

If we project continued growth at 0.4 Exabytes a day in unexpected demand from proof of storage over the next 40 days, plus the 6 Exabytes added since April 20(leaving out first 3 weeks in quarter as they were likely logged last quarter), that's about 22 Exabytes to be added in Q2 that are not part of normal usage, or about an extra ~8% of Q1 demand.

What's perhaps most interesting is the impact this could have on margins. Unlike the GPUs used to mine which are consumer devices, the devices used for mining Chia includes enterprise grade hardware. Prices in the drive market are more flexible at the manufacturer level, and currently have much lower margins. If proof of storage currencies cause a drive shortage, it could have a significant impact on margins. Western digital sells about 40% of its drives through distributors, Seagate about 30%. Sales through these channels generally are very responsive to demand trends in terms of prices.

Seagate is also in a position to profit from this, but I'm a bit more worried about them as hard drive shipments have been on a long term decline and they aren't diversified into SSDs/flash like Western Digital is.

They also have an FDA PDUFA deadline of June 1 for a second application (their first of three was approved in December). If approved this would result in a 100m cash payment from Pfizer.

Alone, these are major catalysts. Right now they stand to go back to back on these catalysts. The last time the company had one catalyst like this, **they were rocketed past $30 a share and gained a strategic partnership from Pfizer.**

Now those are two major catalysts within two weeks, **if FDA decides early, both could happen this week.**

Due to the triple threat data put up in clinical trials and the fact that they had this data peer reviewed and published in the New England journal of medicine, there is strong confidence of approval on the company‚Äôs end.

Last but not least, they have additional catalysts still inbound after. Including Part D and Medicare coverage expected by July 1. All encompassed with a possible buyout from sumitomo.

If you're looking for a good article that covers the basics, you can search the below. Theres also some great posts on reddit and stock twits. I am also happy to answer any questions.

*Why The Misunderstood Pfizer Deal Makes Myovant A Great Low-Risk Investment*

**Quick list of upcoming catalysts:**

THIS WEEK: EMA meets to possibly approve sale of orgovyx in Europe

By June 1: Deadline for FDA approval for a second use case (this could come early and will result in another 100m cash payment from Pfizer)

By July 1: Part d and Medicare coverage: also supposed to be obtained before July 1 for prostate cancer application

Pfizer optionality: Pfizer can opt in to have the rights to sell this in some markets, resulting in a 50m cash payment and royalties paid to myovant. Submission of relugolix for the treatment of endometriosis to the FDA

Catalysts that could happen at any time:  **BUYOUT** from Sumitomo ( aka Sumitovant) or other interested partner (See Urovant history. Sumi has a patent cliff in 2023 they are trying to patch with acquisitions, has purchased 4 of movants sister companies and already owns 53.5% of myovant).

Strategic acquisition of new drug candidates to further myovants pipeline.

**TLDR:**

EU and FDA approvals for drug candidates are expected within the next 2 weeks and could propel this to the moon.

It sounds like an impossibility, but there are simple ways to reading a price chart that enable you to come very close to predicting the direction and turning points of a stock. One of the most important ways is through the identification and marking of channel line patterns.

&#x200B;

[ Prices respect the channel lines ](https://preview.redd.it/fqzpk486qpz61.png?width=1067&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5b02809e77b0f9d4f8162cd558a98154a5aad8e)

Channels lines are one of the most important patterns found on a price chart. They enable you to find the broader trend, or overall direction prices are heading, which is crucial towards choosing the direction of your trade. Sticking with the trend - going long on an uptrend and short on a downtrend - aligns you with the higher probability direction, already setting yourself up for a probable trade.

They also enable you to anticipate and profit from areas where the price has a high likelihood of reversing through a ""bounce"" - where prices hit an upper or lower side of the channel and bounce off of the level like a ball, and heading into the opposite direction. These are key areas because unlike a random point in the chart, a channel line presents a point that has a higher probability of doing one thing over another - *this is an example of where ""edge"" comes from - finding scenarios where one outcome is more likely than the other, and betting on it.*

&#x200B;

[ Channel line pattern with bounces circled ](https://preview.redd.it/f0l668a7qpz61.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=658f753348044acec2cceeaa1dfbf4c6288ae0ff)

## How do you define a channel pattern?

A channel line pattern exists when prices are moving between two parallel trendlines. A trendline is a straight line drawn to connect several major turning points, or swings, in the price chart. When there are two identifiable trendlines that are parallel to each other forming a straight band, prices are *trading within a channel*.

&#x200B;

[ A trendline drawn off of the highs ](https://preview.redd.it/fcfpptc8qpz61.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc81911e78d6e9ee5012760fc53e05f6200513b2)

Trendlines and channels are drawings that highlight the foundational concept of understanding price charts - support and resistance. Support is a level that lies underneath the current price that historically has acted as a cushion for prices, slowing their momentum or causing them to turn right around. Resistance is a level that lies above the current price that historically has acted as a barrier for prices, slowing their momentum or causing a reversal. In this way, support and resistance are one and the same - they are levels that ""support"" or ""resist"", keeping prices within their confines until they lose their power.

&#x200B;

>Prices will often ""test"" support and resistance multiple times and the level will successfully hold, creating areas with a high probability of a bounce - therefore creating trading opportunities.

## How to Draw Channel Lines

So, trendlines connect two or more support or resistance zones, which are areas where prices reversed or showed slowing momentum. Channels are two parallel trendlines. With that, *how can you draw a channel line on a price chart*?

The first consideration is if there is a channel at all. Often, there are ample opportunities to draw trendlines - straight lines connecting s/r. However, it is less often that the chart shows another parallel trendline that price has interacted with. Thus, a textbook ""channel"" with prices neatly filling in the space and bouncing off of the lines is not as easy as it seems to find - **this actually makes the pattern more important, as the discovery of a true channel pattern can lead to very clean bounces and high probability, low risk trades.**

To draw a channel, first find a trendline. Connect important swing lows or highs, and try to find a way to draw a line that connects two or more of the swings, while keeping all of of the other price movement between the swings above the line.

&#x200B;

[ First trendline duplicated and dragged to mark swing lows ](https://preview.redd.it/ss3uggaaqpz61.png?width=561&format=png&auto=webp&s=56e6198235392485a05edaddc3f8d0da4d802d4c)

>A trendline is only as significant as the prices' respect for it - there is no validity to drawing a trendline that connects two swings, while is broken by three other spikes.

Once you've found the trendline, either duplicate the trendline you have just drawn, or if using a channel drawing tool, simply drag the parallel line to see if it can connect two more swings on the opposite side of the price movement.

It takes *a lot* of practice to begin to properly draw channel lines that are valid and are respected by prices. Drawing channel patterns that match historical price charts is hard - and drawing them in a way that can successfully anticipate *future* price movements is even more of a learned skill. This can only be improved by practicing drawing channels on many different charts.

## Types of Channel Lines

The direction of channel lines determine the type of channel pattern. A channel pointed at an upward sloping angle signals an uptrend. A channel pointed at a downward angle signals a downtrend. A channel with a horizontal slope signals a range.

&#x200B;

[ Uptrend ](https://preview.redd.it/s8h4o1xbqpz61.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=1df032e442d4dddf112e30748baedcff16656291)

A concept that is helpful in the identification of a channel's direction is the presence of swing highs and lows. If prices are making higher swings high (peaks) and higher swings low (troughs), chances are they are in an uptrend. If prices are making lower highs and lower lows, they are likely in a downtrend. If there are equal or mismatching swing lows and highs, and prices look more horizontal, a range is likely in play.

&#x200B;

[ Downtrend with channel break ](https://preview.redd.it/wovf3mvcqpz61.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0029bb3d64ea2cb1da1b122a2e477cd0ce827d)

In a trending market, sticking with the direction of the trend can put you on the higher probability side. Combined with an entry identified by the channel lines, this can form the basis of a trading strategy.

In a ranging market, where prices are simply bouncing between two horizontal support and resistance trendlines, any time prices approach or touch the channel lines can be a significant reversal area, where there is a higher probability of a bounce than a breakout through the line.

&#x200B;

[Range](https://preview.redd.it/6z1kj65eqpz61.png?width=1019&format=png&auto=webp&s=3196922b3ddd01cd806ca9f100aa01918bf0b766)

## The Midline and Channel Pattern Breaks

Many channel drawing tools can display a midline, or a line 50% away from both trendlines. This line can serve as an important secondary trendline or support/resistance zone, and often prices react to the midline in a less apparent, but still significant way. Additionally, sometimes prices will break the channel line and form a new high outside of the channel. When this happens, the broken trendline can sometimes become the midline of a wider channel that incorporates the new swing.

&#x200B;

[ Upper channel line turned into midline after breakout ](https://preview.redd.it/wz5gw1peqpz61.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=68d55d124e5799ccc86ac01d5f860786ef24d183)

*When prices break a channel line, it is a sign that the pattern is losing validity.* The trend may be losing steam or accelerating, based on if it breaks the lower or the upper line. A channel line pattern is most valid when there are no price breaks of the trendlines. When prices break the countertrend side (the lower line in an uptrend or the upper line in a downtrend), you can anticipate a reversal soon. When prices break the with-trend side, the trend has accelerated, and you may need to redraw your channel line. This can also be seen as an expenditure of momentum which can bring a trend channel back into a range or a reversal.

## How to Trade With Channel Lines

Because channel line patterns offer areas that have *a higher probability of moving in one direction over the other*, trading strategies can be formed around the pattern. After identifying a valid channel, a strategy may look to buy or sell as price touches the with-trend channel line, setting a stop loss level based on volatility, Fibonacci extensions, or a selection of indicators that can identify momentum and turning points. A take profit level could be determined by a significant support/resistance level, Fibonacci retracements, or indicators similar to those used in stop placement.

&#x200B;

[ A channel bounce trade with \>2:1 risk:reward ](https://preview.redd.it/f24xyxqfqpz61.png?width=1521&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae05a98cdfdfcfb19552fbff3bbb2b5b4331ba7a)

The key advantage to trading channel bounces is the **high risk to reward** offered. A tight stop loss can allow for a high R:R ratio even with a high probability, modest profit target level. Thus, the strategy utilizes *a high probability turning point, a tight stop loss, and a modest profit target* which culminates into a trading plan with a healthy win rate and risk to reward ratio.

Finally, an overlooked aspect of using channels:

&#x200B;

>Channel line patterns have one final key importance to trading - they let you know when to not be in. This helps to reinforce a golden rule of trading - only look to enter trades when there is a higher probability of one thing happening over the other. By watching your channel lines, you'll know when it's there.

&#x200B;

[ Channels force you to be patient and wait for the turning points ](https://preview.redd.it/d3asavogqpz61.png?width=1063&format=png&auto=webp&s=42024fd0d87b9df76edf37e8c33df58b4675684c)

5873,,2021-05-17 17:38:52,t3_nemlpe,,wallstreetbets,"So right now, the mainstream narrative is that inflation is going to run red hot mostly due to a rally in commodity prices. This inflation has the potential to be more than transitory, meaning it lasts more than a couple of quarters at most and will result in forcing the FED to raise rates and crash growth stocks. This is why tech stocks are underperforming while value, or more specifically, manufacturing and mining companies outperform (look at XME for example).

My question is if that is the case, then why are steel futures for U.S. Midwest Domestic Hot-Rolled Coil Steel going down [CME Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/ferrous/hrc-steel_quotes_globex.html)? Right now they peak in June at $1,520 a tonne before steadily going down for the foreseeable future.

Similar things can be said about other commodities such as copper, which remains relatively steady before gradually going down going into next year [Copper Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/base/copper_quotes_globex.html).

On the agriculture side, major commodities like corn appear to be peaking in the near future as well [Corn Futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/grain-and-oilseed/corn_quotes_globex.html).

So taking all of this into account, it would appear that the shape of the futures curves would indicate that commodity prices would peak in near future before gradually going down as supply meets demand. Shouldn't this mean that inflation is indeed transitory as the FED predicts? What am I missing here?

**Tl;Dr:** Futures are showing commodity prices going down in the near future which should drag down inflation rates. Are inflation fears misplaced?",nemlpe,Are Commodity Futures Going Against The Mainstream Inflation Narrative?

It's no secret that companies hire teams of people to brainstorm, draft, and send tweets, but even with the millions of dollars spent on this process it is rare for corporate twitter accounts to have big spikes in followers. Wendy's can obviously tweet some witty stuff that will get lots of likes and retweets, but this usually doesn't motivate most people to sign up for extra ads on their timeline by actually following these accounts.

Wingstop, however, cracked the code on Wednesday by denying the presence of ejaculate in their special white sauce. On Wednesday, one customer tweeted ""wingstop ranch gotta have nut in it no way it‚Äôs just that good"" to which Wingstop replied ""it's a special white sauce but it does not contain \[nut\]""

The rest of the conversation did not contain any more trade secrets on the Wingstop recipe, but it was notable in its own way.

[Twitter screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/2rmwspravqz61.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=090ca925fe321799a1934ea2edfc746480922449)

I rarely ever see companies with hundreds of thousands of followers (Wingstop has over 200k) receive over a 5% increase in Twitter followers over a week. Wingstop had a 10% gain in a matter of days.

The market seemingly reacted with disappointment to the lack of bodily fluids in the secret recipe as $WING fell 2% in the day following the exchange.",nerobc,"Wingstop ($WING) has 11% growth in Twitter followers, 3% drop in stock price after denying that their special white sauce contains human ejaculate"

5901,,2021-05-17 21:46:48,t3_nesw0u,,wallstreetbets,"Hey Guys, it's me again. I think you guys may remember me, after all I wrote an extensive series of DD over a month on UWMC through its trials and tribulations, in anticipation of it's breakout moment. You might even remember my YOLO, and remembered I continuously added to it. And that I eventually upped my margin to 13.5k on it. Well, I'm here to tell you that I'm not out. I bought more calls to average down, on earnings day, and I held them when they tanked to ten cents a pop. My only regret is that I didn't buy more then. Though I threw a bit more cash into shares!

Back then, I said the Theta Beta's would regret selling those calls, and it was one of the few plays where there wouldn't be IV Crush. I was right. Their probably a little sour. Sorry chaps, you usually are the one's making money at our expense. This time it's going to have to be the other way around....

Today, I had the chance to exit my options for a 47% profit roughly. Sell calls for a chunky profit after that. I said no. You know why? Because fuck the people who shorted an extremely profitable company to 6.26 dollars, that's why. The Fear, the Uncertainty, and the Doubt people expressed to me regarding this company espoused to me because of the actions of those people gave me an aneurysm. So fuck them. We're playing Pac Man people. The CEO of UWMC is reducing the float, and increasing the percentage of the float that is sold short while increasing buying pressure. We're buying up the stock to get the price to 9-10 because people bought options for 5-10 cents and they'll be in the money quite easily. And because of the rising volume, every day the CEO is able to buy more and more shares thanks to Rule 10B. The delta on the options is low, and they will need to hedge as the price heads steadily upward on Friday. Then the Shorts are going to be squeezed even further as the market makers hedge.

So no, I won't sell my options for a 10 or a 50% profit. I'm going to sell my options at a price I damn well want to. One that compensates me for the trouble that these people have given me. And so should you.

I understand people have taken profits, but honestly, at the price point they were selling at the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. Good for them though. Next time, could you at least sell deep ITM covered calls though lmao.

And for those people on the fucking fence. You jumped onto MVIS, you jumped into GME, and AMC, and all manners of companies that are either unprofitable or make very little money. But the fucking BOOMER stock is where you hesitate the fence?! The fucking (Eyy Lmaooo) Boomer stock, giving you a 4.87% dividend? The one that, if you somehow baghold can give you 10-15% cash returns through divitendies and covered calls until you get assigned at a strike that is profitable to you? The 10-15% backboard cash that can fund all your yolo's? That's the fucking stock you hesitate on? El LMAO. The companies margins will expand hard in a few months, and it's still hugely profitable at a less than 1 percent margin so yeah. Now if you were buying at 14 fucking bucks, you're a dumb ape, but yeah.

I'm fucking going to ride my options to a fucking profit margin that compensates me for the shit they pulled, or to a GUH. No in between. The Stock Buyback middle finger is just the fucking sweetener.

Matt Daddy, and I, and all the people who everyone called bag holders are going to skull fuck the shorters harder than they skull fucked UWMC's share price. They're going to fucking Guh their way into a fucking shoebox. Fuck em. I want me tendies well cooked, a side of fries, and a foot massage. And their going to give it to me. And to all of you who bought, and are buying UWMC.

They did it with blockbuster but they were more vocal about it, and in turn their stock price plummeted for 4 years because the people found out what they did after they went under and hiked prices by 60%. *but that was soon forgotten*

\- It would be great if Netflix could take over in person movie theaters..

The two stocks that they projected would gain the most are listed below. 
- FuelCell Energy (FCEL) 
- iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN) 
These two are predicted to skyrocket under the Biden administration due to his push for renewable energy, especially if the Green New Deal is passed.

The setup is a symmetrical triangle. Normally when continuation patterns come from downside - they have a bearish bias. However - we broke that red trendline  with an uptick in volume - this was a hint we were ready for an actual reversal. That trendline kept us in a downtrend for about 4 months. Not only that but...

**TODAY WE BROKE THE SYMMETRICAL TRIANGLE UP - WHICH MEANS ITS FULL SPEED AHEAD!**

Confluence between technicals generate the best signals.

This is the best the setup has looked since GME was at 10. Price target for this is 231.52 resistance initially, followed by 348.50. Breakout is invalid and play is dead if we get a daily close back under 158.11.

And... that's it.

I've been trading for a long time and only use patterns, trendlines & volume. Keep it simple. You don't need to waste 100 hours doing 15 paragraphs of DD for one swing trade - or look at 100 different indicators cherry picking the ones that say your position will go up.

***TL;DR*** \- GME actually looks good for once from an **unbiased** technical standpoint

***EDIT:*** Clarification - I wasn't speaking for GME as a whole when I said it was dead under 158.11 - I simply meant this setup in particular was no longer valid. It could always form a new one. I chose that level because it's the most significant one below the breakout point.

$CNK is AMCs largest competitor and is in the great business we know as movie theaters. When AMC last went crazy, CNK ran up over 56% in a few days from 22-27 of January to $27+. In the past month, AMC is up over 50%. CNK is roughly even. It is lagging behind and is due for a major pop on this AMC craze. It is a classically more boring stock that takes a big nudge to move.

Breaking out similar to AMC. Insanely strong volume shelf in low 20s (high demand) and above 1D 21MA. RSI has lots of room to run. 

**MARGIN**

CNK has a much lower implied volatility and actually allows for margin borrowing. This could be attractive depending on your risk appetite

**DILUTION/FINANCIALS**

CNK has almost no share dilution since the pandemic started, and it has been historically stronger than AMC from a traditional (retarded) financial perspective. AMCs market value growth has passed CNKs by many multiples over the past year. No reason she can't get some love.

His $TSLA puts are generating the most interest from the media, but the position that stuck out most to me is his puts on $TLT, the 20-year treasury bond etf. It makes sense, if inflation really is upon us, the fed will have to raise rates soon. Higher rates = lower price per bond = lower $TLT. This seems way too intuitive and I feel like an idiot for not thinking of it a month ago, but obviously that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not Dr. Burry. I‚Äôm sure he got in a while ago and is already up a bunch of money, but I feel like there are still gains to be made in this trade in the months ahead.

The reason I‚Äôm posting is that $TLT has already come down a fair amount in the past month, but this still seems like an easy money play on inflation. Is there something I‚Äôm missing or is it really that simple? The 13F for Scion Asset Management doesn‚Äôt detail the strike price or expiration for the puts, but I‚Äôm thinking about going in for a few 1/21/22 $125 puts on $TLT.

Glacier Capital exists. That sentence isn't going to make me any friends, but your wallet needs to hear it. They've even written some insightful pieces which panned out as per the analyses; CVNA (link below) performed well in the short-term as predicted, but the majority shareholder and CEO sold practically all of his shares four days ago, al in line with their poor long-term outlook.

A lot of the theorising focuses on the founding year of the company. Look... the profile on Bloomberg is for a different Glacier Capital LLC. There appear to be quite a few Glacier Capital LLCs. In the US, LLC names are not unique on a federal level. Unrelated companies in different states can have exactly the same name.

When we consider that the CEO of *the* Glacier Capital was still a university student in 2005, we can safely conclude this isn't a smoking gun and it's likely we're tripping up over unrelated companies.

Look at the dates. When the whole GME surge was first kicking off, Glacier Capital filed to register for a 'Legal Entity Identifier' (LEI) in order to comply with 'Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II' (MiFID II), which was a tightening of regulations within the EU in 2008. LEIs are required in order to comply with MiFID II, and MiFID II needs to be complied with in order to carry out certain high risk activities, including forms/scales of derivatives.

I am not a European financial services lawyer but considering the timing of everything, it seems reasonable to assume that the short positions may be real - and if new certs were put in place just for one series of positions, then it isn't crazy to think they might be especially large.

Again, *I am not saying* that this isn't an incestuous industry or that the capital isn't coming from known players. I am specifically begging you not to be a fucking dumbfuck because of one Reddit-cum-Sherlock post so that whatever dumbass decision you make next is at least a little less erratic.

If you read those footnotes, you can see that some judges on the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (which is 7 very qualified federal judges) have recused themselves and others have had to renounce their claims (normal for judges) against the defendants to even participate, as they would have been members of the several putative actions.

1.**The Fed will cap yields and do whatever it takes to support the economy and markets‚Äîi.e., much more dollar printing.**

**Let me dig in !**

The recent NFIB survey suggests we are only in an economic recovery, not an expansion.

NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

üì∑

Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *‚Äúactually‚Äù* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *‚Äúdemand‚Äù* meets its operating cash flows.

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ew6w5tu19vz61.png?width=804&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bba4677ec15d513e78d6d19644722b133068a48

Businesses understand that the stimulus [***‚Äúpulled forward‚Äù***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)

much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***‚Äúcosts‚Äù*** **of** ***‚Äúlong-term employment‚Äù*** **for a** ***‚Äúshort-term‚Äù*** **artificial economic boost.**

The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.**¬†Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0bcfon349vz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=89b498f76db582407f08e593e10dc5692e6005f2

 

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive. Therefore **Fed will cap yields and do whatever it takes to support the economy , employment and markets.**

At the risk of repeating myself, the risk to the upside in the 30-Year yield is capped somewhere between 2.75-3.00%,

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w1cuikh69vz61.png?width=836&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b01f66a5badd3fc80e79abecd97096e309324a5

 

2. **Inflation will rise dramatically, and the risk is that it‚Äôll be worse than expected:**

We finally got ‚Äúofficial‚Äù confirmation in May that inflation has already begun to take off:

The headline CPI year-over-year increase at 4.2% was the highest since 2008. Energy prices rose 25% and gas prices 50%. Rising energy prices filter through to almost everything. Used car and truck prices were up 21%. Rents rose 2.1%. If you substitute home prices for rents, that number more than doubled.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1qccmij89vz61.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7c72ce894c8a9cddbf6a739715174d69d093229

 On top of all that, the CPI is widely understood to dramatically understate inflation, so the increases are much worse than the headline numbers. As I like to say, one just has to look at the performance of commodity futures over the past year, or go to Home Depot or the grocery store. It‚Äôs not rocket science. This will continue until the monetary and fiscal stimulus stops, small and medium-sized businesses return, and employment rises significantly. Don‚Äôt hold your breath, 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fjw00bba9vz61.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=a09d8f5b80ba4ea16d4fe02b812aa64a15ff8c3c

 

The month-over-month increases were far higher than expected, double in the case of the headline PPI. These are the prices that filter through to consumer prices over time‚Äîi.e., the CPI is likely going even higher.¬†

If that were not enough, wage inflation is on the rise, too, as employers struggle to get people off the couch who can otherwise live on their stimulus checks. Checks that are unlikely to be inflation indexed. Several States have already begun or are considering a ‚Äúreturn to work bonus‚Äù in order to get people to go back to work.

""Therefore I assume inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside .""

Conclusion and Goals :

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

The scenario to play out in weeks in precious Metals ;

 

Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and Gold and the metals soar.Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields.I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks.

Gold & silver's monthly defined 2021 road map still intact. Q2 and Q4 belong to silver, while gold will shine in Q3. For Silver q2 /2021 my targets are 42 Usd /ozz while gold 1.900 Usd/ozz .

A short squeeze involves buying into a stock en masse causing its price to rise, and the shorter, who has borrowed the stock with hopes the price would go down has to cover increases in expenses associated with holding the stock, or sell out at a loss. This forces the stock price up further and it becomes a snowball effect.       

My understanding is a gamma squeeze is similar, but it applies to covering options contracts where the holder is expecting the underlying stock to decrease in price.          

In most cases it's an entity that's capable of trading in huge numbers that is shorting, so they will be sticky about simply getting away from the holding because time is usually on their side. If there are equally stubborn buyers of the stock who continue to hold after it's price has increased, the shorter is screwed.",,

Historically speaking interest rates have been raised to slow down the economy and hedge against inflation. The problem is we've been printing so much money that devaluation of the dollar is inevitable. Pair that with rising interest rates, you'll have a huge amount of inflation the likes of which we haven't seen in this country in quite some time. But based on what I've seen since January's inauguration, as inflation increases, and rates go up, the job market will get worse unemployment will rise, and what will the whole of the US government do? Print more money. It's a vicious cycle. Most on the sub are probably too young to remember the '80s, but I was born in '78. I remember waiting in lines for gas even in Texas where it was readily available. Not due to a shortage. Just really bad economics.

I agree with the short, I'm sure he's figured out the way to do it right. But if we're reading about it online we're too late to the party. There may still be some money available, but the government can prop itself up for a long time. Plus, I'm sure he figured the filing exposure into his scenario.

Lumber futures have fallen over 25% in the past week. Is this the legendary cyclical demand glut fizzling while the available supply surges? 
Possibly, but not likely. It‚Äôs more likely that people aren‚Äôt starting new projects and haven n‚Äôt been for awhile. In progress projects will pay those high prices because you end up losing money when half built stuff sits. Most summer seasons are bad for building material demand anyway, which is probably only exacerbating the drop.  I‚Äôm not bold enough to put a price on where lumber futures will stabilize, but for the sake of my calls I‚Äôm going to say. ‚ÄúSoon‚Äù. Lumber companies are making bank when the price is above 400, let alone 1700. Many will find profit margins take a significant hit when it does fall to 400 though, the extra capacity lines they bring on during periods of high demand have higher marginal costs. 

I‚Äôm still wagering these companies are fairly undervalued due to the overall high sustained demand for more housing in suburban and rural areas, especially considering supply conditions in general, and I believe the shift to remote work, and the houses people will want, is going to keep demand higher than expected for several years.

Step 1 for me is zooming out. Despite the current market WELL actually held up quite strong - Beautiful Weekly close wicked just above the 20day SMA forming a nice support (Double bottom) in this 6.20 -8.20 channel. If we can snap this losing streak I think that might be our immediate next stop.

Stochastic's oversold and the RSI is closely following. On a shorter time frame we can see that bulls finished the Friday session off strong positioning us in a nice spot technically as we are sitting on the 20day SMA.

If we can open above 6.9 (50day SMA) I think we can close around that 7.14 (200day SMA) level which should line us up for that move out of the $6-$8 range and into the $10s and beyond.

Now funny enough what actually has me the most bullish this morning is looking at Friday alone. Selling pressure was suppressed by the bulls and it closed right near HOD above all major resistances.

UWMC is ready to pop!

I was in UWMC for the value play. It is a STEAL at 10$ on fundamentals anything below that is an insane deal. Even above 10 has a strong long-term argument.

Here is UWMC in a nutshell: heavily shorted, borrow costs skyrocketing, mortgage industry hit overly hard on fears of rising interest rates, the CEO Ishiba announces a 300M stock buyback, and shorts are QUAKING. UP 6% in premarket following being up 1-2% Friday. This puts at starting at $8 Monday with $9 being a CRITICAL Friday target for us.

All UWMC needs is a little unexpected retail buying pressure and it POPS! In truth this is not just a short squeeze, its multiple plays rolled into one. We have retail buying hype train going (obviously, look at all the WSB posts here posted below), short-squeeze due to high cost of borrow, Gamma squeeze due to the MASSIVE options interest, 300M stock buyback by CEO to scare off the shorts, an unfair post-earnings plunge, plus good-ole\` company doing good things (making money).

We coming back for some of our loyal bagholders that have been holding UWMC since the last train to $14, hey guys remember to take profit this time ;)

It is now cost-prohibitive to use more shorts to keep the price low. The normal dirty tricks triple in price so become less-used. Shorts use this borrow price to determine feasibility and 93% is obviously unfeasible, THEY WILL COVER. Once one group starts covering and causes a spike, other shorts will rush to do the same.

It's a prisoner's dilemma and HF's want to cut each other's throats just as much as ours. Let's let them!!!

Many of these 7.50,9. 10, and 12 are OTM or barely ITM. and an early week spike to put 9c ITM would force MM's to hedge to delta-neutral...further pushing 10c and 12.50 c into hedge territory. This can quickly cause things to spiral out of control for shorts.

Stock BuyBack,

Ishbia is going to war with the shorts and his weapon of choice is a 300M stock buyback (similar to RKT's special dividend for the same purpose). The buyback could have started happening as early as May 11th.

Most of the float is owned by institutions and insiders so this buyback puts increased pressure of a heavily shorted (13%+) and heavily held float pool.

Retail is gorging on the float, institutions are holding the float, and Ishbia is buying the free float up. This is a recipe for ROCKET FUEL. WIth shorts paying 93%, they will stop shorting so the shares we are buying are REAL, not synthetic.

Make them buy real shares, from us, at 20$ each.

I am in UWMC for the long-term VALUE-PLAY and like the stock. I like the company., I like the CEO. I like the market position. I like the value. I ilke the stock.

I am loading up on 6/18 8c options. Options are important as we move up to force MM's to buy to remain market neutral.

Options do not pay unless we buy shares, so I suggest splitting half/half to each. options can cause MM's to balance risk and lead to large upswings but this cannot happen without buying pressure and the underlying spiking to necessitate balancing risk, which means we need to buy stocks as well.

Options are good for Gamma Squeeze/MM's balance buys (and profit) but shares are needed to keep the underlying JOOSED and keep those options deep ITM.

MIX IT UP!

This is the final call for the UWMC tendie train so get your fucking tickets and remember; Gravy costs extra,

6402,,2021-05-17 13:20:55,t3_neg3ey,,wallstreetbets,"$UWMC has become one of the most hyped stocks in the online investment community. Online activity appears to be ramping up after earnings and heading into May 21st option expiries. Since UWM is getting a lot of new eyes, it seemed like an appropriate time to share why some investors may consider UWM as a long term hold. 

UWM is a mortgage company that focuses exclusively on the broker channel. It‚Äôs the largest wholesale mortgage provider in the US and the second largest mortgage originator, behind Rocket Companies. 

It‚Äôs CEO is Mat Ishbia, who started as it‚Äôs 12th employee and who‚Äôs dad, Jeff, started the company as a side hustle. Mat and his brother own 94% of the company in Class D shares. The rest of the public float, \~100m Class A shares, are what is available for the public to purchase. 

# What trends are pushing $UWMC‚Äôs stock down? 

**The largest threat UWM is facing is raising interest rates**: 

About 75% of UWM income is related to refinance activity. The pandemic pushed rates to historic lows so most consumers were better off refinancing. Millions have done that, leading to record profit for mortgage providers like UWM and Rocket. 

**The strength of the broker channel:**

UWM is completely dependent on brokers finding business and closing loans. It doesn‚Äôt have any direct-to-consumer lending operations like Rocket does. 

**Short Interest:** 

Sophisticated investors are seeing 75% of income potentially attached to rate sensitive products (not all refi‚Äôs are rate sensitive like cash out), and are salivating. They think the market is under appreciating this headwind and shorting the stock. They have basically shorted all the shares they can. Friday the stock ended with 200 shares available and an insane 93% borrow rate. 

**SPAC:**

It is true that the SPAC market has softened recently. It is very reasonable to assume $UWMC is a part of that softening. It may not attract institutional investors because of the SPAC situation and the short period it has been publicly traded. Lots of other nice places to put institutional money.

**Competitors:** Mortgages are a mature market and competition is fierce. Rocket, LoanDepot and UWM mentioned a pricing war in their earnings. (LD statement). This will compress loan sale margins in the short term. 

**What trends are pushing $UWMC stock up?** 

**Short term retail pressure:**

there is a lot of retail attention on the potential short squeeze/gamma squeeze you could see this week in UWMC. My post is about UWM‚Äôs long term perspective, so I‚Äôll let [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ndcm0p/uwmc_is_a_powderkeg_low_float_high_short_huge/) take you further down that rabbit hole. Additionally, smart money is now tracking online sentiment, which can lead to increased institutional purchases. 

**Broker Channel Growth:** Mat has claimed two reasons for taking UWM public. He wanted access to the liquidity market and marketing exposure for the broker channel. For UWM to become the largest mortgage originator, Mat has targeted ‚Öì mortgages to be originated by brokers and UWM to own 50% of that channel by 2025/26. Currently UWM owns 36% of the broker channel with brokers originating 20% of all mortgages. Before the housing crisis in 2008, brokers were 58% of mortgage originations (Per Mat & Q1 2021 Earnings call), so it isn‚Äôt crazy to think they could get back to ‚Öì as it is growing: [https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum](https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum)

I had a loan with Rocket and tried to refinance with them. I then went through a mortgage broker and got the same loan for $4.5k cheaper in closing costs. This is because Rocket‚Äôs retail channel has 4% margins and it‚Äôs partnership network (includes wholesale, realtors, etc.) has 1% margins. 

**New Product Offerings:** 

UWM recently released new products like their jumbo loan. In earnings, Mat said he expects $2b in volume from Jumbo. They also added ARM‚Äôs, manufactured homes and expanded government programs. 

**Wholesale mortgage provider consolidation:** 

Mat said 3 of the top 25 wholesale lenders have been purchased in the last 90 days. This type of consolidation happens in mature markets by companies that are reaching for market share. THis could be a sign companies are under pressure to grow but cannot organically get market share from UWM. 

**UWM ‚ÄúAll In‚Äù Ultimatum:** 

Rocket and Fairway are priortizing other channels (cause the margins are so much higher) and trying to squeeze out brokers. UWM said if you work with those two, don‚Äôt work for us. The goal was to stand up for the broker channel WHILE putting some pressure on Rocket and Fairway‚Äôs partnership channel. This may have kickstarted the pricing war. 

**Aggressive Capital returns:** 

UWM pays an annual .40 dividend on its class A shares. That only costs them \~$42m/year. Remember their Q1 net income was $800m+. So their dividends hardly affect the balance sheet. The board just approved a $300/million share buyback as well that will reduce share count. Mat knows a thing or two about shorting stocks. He just sold at $10 and has authority to buy back with the current price under $8. The man successfully shorted his own company. What a legend. 

**Long Term Prediction:** 

I‚Äôm invested in UWM because I believe the capital returns will be aggressive during the upswing and the company will remain profitable in a downturn. With a 5%+ dividend return, share buyback, and \*potentially\* growing market share, UWM could be primed to overtake Rocket within the next few years.

6406,,2021-05-17 14:45:52,t3_nei5qk,,wallstreetbets,"As the cloud & big data continues to grow, as well as social media & 4k/8k video, data storage is becoming more important than ever.

Large social media sites take in a tremendous amount of data each day. This storage must not only be stored, but stored with redundancy as well as backups. Major sites such as Facebook and YouTube keep content that is over a decade old. Over time, the drives holding this content will fail and need to be replaced, leading to growing recurring demand as the size of the platform grows.

The need for storage has been growing for decades, but innovation in storage density and intense competition has limited profitability in the market in the past. That being said, there is reason to believe that the growth in storage density may stop keeping up with the growth in storage needs.

There is also reason to believe that transient growth in storage demand may drive higher Q2 earnings. A new digital currency, Chia, has gobbled up about 6 Exabytes worth of storage in the past 3 weeks, now growing at a rate of about 0.4 EiB per day(and rising). https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/netspace

For reference, about 288 Exabytes worth of hard drives were shipped in Q1 2021 https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hdd-shipments-in-q1-2021

Chia network size can be considered a lagging indicator for unexpected drive shipments. Generally, it can take a few weeks between when a drive is purchased and when it's actually accounted for on the network, as it takes time for it to be shipped, set up, and plotted. Chia wasn't even listed on exchanges until a couple weeks ago, so most of the growth seen is prior to Chia even having a price. At current prices, mining is incredibly profitable, with a $500 14 TB drive estimated to produce about $26 per day, and using very little power. So even if the network grows 10x to 60 Exabytes, it's still producing $3/day at current prices. So expect the surge in demand to continue.

I have seen many anecdotes of drive shortages over the past couple weeks. Reviewing sites like Amazon, I have also seen high capacity drives go out of stock or require lead times of a few weeks.

This may be a bit reminiscent of GPU shortages among Nvidia and AMD as miners seek to buy up anything they can.

If we project continued growth at 0.4 Exabytes a day in unexpected demand from proof of storage over the next 40 days, plus the 6 Exabytes added since April 20(leaving out first 3 weeks in quarter as they were likely logged last quarter), that's about 22 Exabytes to be added in Q2 that are not part of normal usage, or about an extra ~8% of Q1 demand.

What's perhaps most interesting is the impact this could have on margins. Unlike the GPUs used to mine which are consumer devices, the devices used for mining Chia includes enterprise grade hardware. Prices in the drive market are more flexible at the manufacturer level, and currently have much lower margins. If proof of storage currencies cause a drive shortage, it could have a significant impact on margins. Western digital sells about 40% of its drives through distributors, Seagate about 30%.

The EMA (EU medical agency like FDA) announced Myovant and Relugolix as up for review to be accepted for Marketing approval in the EU this week. This is a huge catalyst in the biotech industry, and due to their Pfizer partnership this could result in a 50m cash payment to Myovant as well.

They also have an FDA PDUFA deadline of June 1 for a second application (their first of three was approved in December). If approved this would result in a 100m cash payment from Pfizer.

Alone, these are major catalysts. Right now they stand to go back to back on these catalysts. The last time the company had one catalyst like this, **they were rocketed past $30 a share and gained a strategic partnership from Pfizer.**

Now those are two major catalysts within two weeks, **if FDA decides early, both could happen this week.**

Due to the triple threat data put up in clinical trials and the fact that they had this data peer reviewed and published in the New England journal of medicine, there is strong confidence of approval on the company‚Äôs end.

Last but not least, they have additional catalysts still inbound after. Including Part D and Medicare coverage expected by July 1. All encompassed with a possible buyout from sumitomo.

If you're looking for a good article that covers the basics, you can search the below. Theres also some great posts on reddit and stock twits. I am also happy to answer any questions.

*Why The Misunderstood Pfizer Deal Makes Myovant A Great Low-Risk Investment*

**Quick list of upcoming catalysts:**

THIS WEEK: EMA meets to possibly approve sale of orgovyx in Europe

By June 1: Deadline for FDA approval for a second use case (this could come early and will result in another 100m cash payment from Pfizer)

By July 1: Part d and Medicare coverage: also supposed to be obtained before July 1 for prostate cancer application

Pfizer optionality: Pfizer can opt in to have the rights to sell this in some markets, resulting in a 50m cash payment and royalties paid to myovant. Submission of relugolix for the treatment of endometriosis to the FDA

Catalysts that could happen at any time:  **BUYOUT** from Sumitomo ( aka Sumitovant) or other interested partner (See Urovant history. Sumi has a patent cliff in 2023 they are trying to patch with acquisitions, has purchased 4 of movants sister companies and already owns 53.5% of myovant).

Strategic acquisition of new drug candidates to further myovants pipeline.

**TLDR:**

EU and FDA approvals for drug candidates are expected within the next 2 weeks and could propel this to the moon.

It sounds like an impossibility, but there are simple ways to reading a price chart that enable you to come very close to predicting the direction and turning points of a stock. One of the most important ways is through the identification and marking of channel line patterns.

&#x200B;

[ Prices respect the channel lines ](https://preview.redd.it/fqzpk486qpz61.png?width=1067&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5b02809e77b0f9d4f8162cd558a98154a5aad8e)

Channels lines are one of the most important patterns found on a price chart. They enable you to find the broader trend, or overall direction prices are heading, which is crucial towards choosing the direction of your trade. Sticking with the trend - going long on an uptrend and short on a downtrend - aligns you with the higher probability direction, already setting yourself up for a probable trade.

They also enable you to anticipate and profit from areas where the price has a high likelihood of reversing through a ""bounce"" - where prices hit an upper or lower side of the channel and bounce off of the level like a ball, and heading into the opposite direction. These are key areas because unlike a random point in the chart, a channel line presents a point that has a higher probability of doing one thing over another - *this is an example of where ""edge"" comes from - finding scenarios where one outcome is more likely than the other, and betting on it.*

&#x200B;

[ Channel line pattern with bounces circled ](https://preview.redd.it/f0l668a7qpz61.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=658f753348044acec2cceeaa1dfbf4c6288ae0ff)

## How do you define a channel pattern?

A channel line pattern exists when prices are moving between two parallel trendlines. A trendline is a straight line drawn to connect several major turning points, or swings, in the price chart. When there are two identifiable trendlines that are parallel to each other forming a straight band, prices are *trading within a channel*.

&#x200B;

[ A trendline drawn off of the highs ](https://preview.redd.it/fcfpptc8qpz61.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc81911e78d6e9ee5012760fc53e05f6200513b2)

Trendlines and channels are drawings that highlight the foundational concept of understanding price charts - support and resistance. Support is a level that lies underneath the current price that historically has acted as a cushion for prices, slowing their momentum or causing them to turn right around. Resistance is a level that lies above the current price that historically has acted as a barrier for prices, slowing their momentum or causing a reversal. In this way, support and resistance are one and the same - they are levels that ""support"" or ""resist"", keeping prices within their confines until they lose their power.

&#x200B;

>Prices will often ""test"" support and resistance multiple times and the level will successfully hold, creating areas with a high probability of a bounce - therefore creating trading opportunities.

## How to Draw Channel Lines

So, trendlines connect two or more support or resistance zones, which are areas where prices reversed or showed slowing momentum. Channels are two parallel trendlines. With that, *how can you draw a channel line on a price chart*?

The first consideration is if there is a channel at all. Often, there are ample opportunities to draw trendlines - straight lines connecting s/r. However, it is less often that the chart shows another parallel trendline that price has interacted with. Thus, a textbook ""channel"" with prices neatly filling in the space and bouncing off of the lines is not as easy as it seems to find - **this actually makes the pattern more important, as the discovery of a true channel pattern can lead to very clean bounces and high probability, low risk trades.**

To draw a channel, first find a trendline. Connect important swing lows or highs, and try to find a way to draw a line that connects two or more of the swings, while keeping all of of the other price movement between the swings above the line.

&#x200B;

[ First trendline duplicated and dragged to mark swing lows ](https://preview.redd.it/ss3uggaaqpz61.png?width=561&format=png&auto=webp&s=56e6198235392485a05edaddc3f8d0da4d802d4c)

>A trendline is only as significant as the prices' respect for it - there is no validity to drawing a trendline that connects two swings, while is broken by three other spikes.

Once you've found the trendline, either duplicate the trendline you have just drawn, or if using a channel drawing tool, simply drag the parallel line to see if it can connect two more swings on the opposite side of the price movement.

It takes *a lot* of practice to begin to properly draw channel lines that are valid and are respected by prices. Drawing channel patterns that match historical price charts is hard - and drawing them in a way that can successfully anticipate *future* price movements is even more of a learned skill. This can only be improved by practicing drawing channels on many different charts.

## Types of Channel Lines

The direction of channel lines determine the type of channel pattern. A channel pointed at an upward sloping angle signals an uptrend. A channel pointed at a downward angle signals a downtrend. A channel with a horizontal slope signals a range.

&#x200B;

[ Uptrend ](https://preview.redd.it/s8h4o1xbqpz61.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=1df032e442d4dddf112e30748baedcff16656291)

A concept that is helpful in the identification of a channel's direction is the presence of swing highs and lows. If prices are making higher swings high (peaks) and higher swings low (troughs), chances are they are in an uptrend. If prices are making lower highs and lower lows, they are likely in a downtrend. If there are equal or mismatching swing lows and highs, and prices look more horizontal, a range is likely in play.

&#x200B;

[ Downtrend with channel break ](https://preview.redd.it/wovf3mvcqpz61.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0029bb3d64ea2cb1da1b122a2e477cd0ce827d)

In a trending market, sticking with the direction of the trend can put you on the higher probability side. Combined with an entry identified by the channel lines, this can form the basis of a trading strategy.

In a ranging market, where prices are simply bouncing between two horizontal support and resistance trendlines, any time prices approach or touch the channel lines can be a significant reversal area, where there is a higher probability of a bounce than a breakout through the line.

&#x200B;

[Range](https://preview.redd.it/6z1kj65eqpz61.png?width=1019&format=png&auto=webp&s=3196922b3ddd01cd806ca9f100aa01918bf0b766)

## The Midline and Channel Pattern Breaks

Many channel drawing tools can display a midline, or a line 50% away from both trendlines. This line can serve as an important secondary trendline or support/resistance zone, and often prices react to the midline in a less apparent, but still significant way. Additionally, sometimes prices will break the channel line and form a new high outside of the channel. When this happens, the broken trendline can sometimes become the midline of a wider channel that incorporates the new swing.

&#x200B;

[ Upper channel line turned into midline after breakout ](https://preview.redd.it/wz5gw1peqpz61.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=68d55d124e5799ccc86ac01d5f860786ef24d183)

*When prices break a channel line, it is a sign that the pattern is losing validity.* The trend may be losing steam or accelerating, based on if it breaks the lower or the upper line. A channel line pattern is most valid when there are no price breaks of the trendlines. When prices break the countertrend side (the lower line in an uptrend or the upper line in a downtrend), you can anticipate a reversal soon. When prices break the with-trend side, the trend has accelerated, and you may need to redraw your channel line. This can also be seen as an expenditure of momentum which can bring a trend channel back into a range or a reversal.

## How to Trade With Channel Lines

Because channel line patterns offer areas that have *a higher probability of moving in one direction over the other*, trading strategies can be formed around the pattern. After identifying a valid channel, a strategy may look to buy or sell as price touches the with-trend channel line, setting a stop loss level based on volatility, Fibonacci extensions, or a selection of indicators that can identify momentum and turning points. A take profit level could be determined by a significant support/resistance level, Fibonacci retracements, or indicators similar to those used in stop placement.

&#x200B;

[ A channel bounce trade with \>2:1 risk:reward ](https://preview.redd.it/f24xyxqfqpz61.png?width=1521&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae05a98cdfdfcfb19552fbff3bbb2b5b4331ba7a)

The key advantage to trading channel bounces is the **high risk to reward** offered. A tight stop loss can allow for a high R:R ratio even with a high probability, modest profit target level. Thus, the strategy utilizes *a high probability turning point, a tight stop loss, and a modest profit target* which culminates into a trading plan with a healthy win rate and risk to reward ratio.

Finally, an overlooked aspect of using channels:

&#x200B;

>Channel line patterns have one final key importance to trading - they let you know when to not be in. This helps to reinforce a golden rule of trading - only look to enter trades when there is a higher probability of one thing happening over the other. By watching your channel lines, you'll know when it's there.

&#x200B;

[ Channels force you to be patient and wait for the turning points ](https://preview.redd.it/d3asavogqpz61.png?width=1063&format=png&auto=webp&s=42024fd0d87b9df76edf37e8c33df58b4675684c)

6418,,2021-05-17 17:38:52,t3_nemlpe,,wallstreetbets,"So right now, the mainstream narrative is that inflation is going to run red hot mostly due to a rally in commodity prices. This inflation has the potential to be more than transitory, meaning it lasts more than a couple of quarters at most and will result in forcing the FED to raise rates and crash growth stocks. This is why tech stocks are underperforming while value, or more specifically, manufacturing and mining companies outperform (look at XME for example).

My question is if that is the case, then why are steel futures for U.S. Midwest Domestic Hot-Rolled Coil Steel going down [CME Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/ferrous/hrc-steel_quotes_globex.html)? Right now they peak in June at $1,520 a tonne before steadily going down for the foreseeable future.

Similar things can be said about other commodities such as copper, which remains relatively steady before gradually going down going into next year [Copper Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/base/copper_quotes_globex.html).

On the agriculture side, major commodities like corn appear to be peaking in the near future as well [Corn Futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/grain-and-oilseed/corn_quotes_globex.html).

So taking all of this into account, it would appear that the shape of the futures curves would indicate that commodity prices would peak in near future before gradually going down as supply meets demand. Shouldn't this mean that inflation is indeed transitory as the FED predicts? What am I missing here?

**Tl;Dr:** Futures are showing commodity prices going down in the near future which should drag down inflation rates. Are inflation fears misplaced?",nemlpe,Are Commodity Futures Going Against The Mainstream Inflation Narrative?

This stock isn't a yolo for me, but hey I'm up like 15% in the last week so we doing good. They also post really high EPS and we can all love a company that makes money.... Enter at your own risk and do your own DD. I understand many of you are autistic, but I am not your care taker.

It's no secret that companies hire teams of people to brainstorm, draft, and send tweets, but even with the millions of dollars spent on this process it is rare for corporate twitter accounts to have big spikes in followers. Wendy's can obviously tweet some witty stuff that will get lots of likes and retweets, but this usually doesn't motivate most people to sign up for extra ads on their timeline by actually following these accounts.

Wingstop, however, cracked the code on Wednesday by denying the presence of ejaculate in their special white sauce. On Wednesday, one customer tweeted ""wingstop ranch gotta have nut in it no way it‚Äôs just that good"" to which Wingstop replied ""it's a special white sauce but it does not contain \[nut\]""

The rest of the conversation did not contain any more trade secrets on the Wingstop recipe, but it was notable in its own way.

[Twitter screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/2rmwspravqz61.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=090ca925fe321799a1934ea2edfc746480922449)

I rarely ever see companies with hundreds of thousands of followers (Wingstop has over 200k) receive over a 5% increase in Twitter followers over a week. Wingstop had a 10% gain in a matter of days.

The market seemingly reacted with disappointment to the lack of bodily fluids in the secret recipe as $WING fell 2% in the day following the exchange.",nerobc,"Wingstop ($WING) has 11% growth in Twitter followers, 3% drop in stock price after denying that their special white sauce contains human ejaculate"

6446,,2021-05-17 21:46:48,t3_nesw0u,,wallstreetbets,"Hey Guys, it's me again. I think you guys may remember me, after all I wrote an extensive series of DD over a month on UWMC through its trials and tribulations, in anticipation of it's breakout moment. You might even remember my YOLO, and remembered I continuously added to it. And that I eventually upped my margin to 13.5k on it. Well, I'm here to tell you that I'm not out. I bought more calls to average down, on earnings day, and I held them when they tanked to ten cents a pop. My only regret is that I didn't buy more then. Though I threw a bit more cash into shares!

Back then, I said the Theta Beta's would regret selling those calls, and it was one of the few plays where there wouldn't be IV Crush. I was right. Their probably a little sour. Sorry chaps, you usually are the one's making money at our expense. This time it's going to have to be the other way around....

Today, I had the chance to exit my options for a 47% profit roughly. Sell calls for a chunky profit after that. I said no. You know why? Because fuck the people who shorted an extremely profitable company to 6.26 dollars, that's why. The Fear, the Uncertainty, and the Doubt people expressed to me regarding this company espoused to me because of the actions of those people gave me an aneurysm. So fuck them. We're playing Pac Man people. The CEO of UWMC is reducing the float, and increasing the percentage of the float that is sold short while increasing buying pressure. We're buying up the stock to get the price to 9-10 because people bought options for 5-10 cents and they'll be in the money quite easily. And because of the rising volume, every day the CEO is able to buy more and more shares thanks to Rule 10B. The delta on the options is low, and they will need to hedge as the price heads steadily upward on Friday. Then the Shorts are going to be squeezed even further as the market makers hedge.

So no, I won't sell my options for a 10 or a 50% profit. I'm going to sell my options at a price I damn well want to. One that compensates me for the trouble that these people have given me. And so should you.

I understand people have taken profits, but honestly, at the price point they were selling at the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. Good for them though. Next time, could you at least sell deep ITM covered calls though lmao.

And for those people on the fucking fence. You jumped onto MVIS, you jumped into GME, and AMC, and all manners of companies that are either unprofitable or make very little money. But the fucking BOOMER stock is where you hesitate the fence?! The fucking (Eyy Lmaooo) Boomer stock, giving you a 4.87% dividend? The one that, if you somehow baghold can give you 10-15% cash returns through divitendies and covered calls until you get assigned at a strike that is profitable to you? The 10-15% backboard cash that can fund all your yolo's? That's the fucking stock you hesitate on? El LMAO. The companies margins will expand hard in a few months, and it's still hugely profitable at a less than 1 percent margin so yeah. Now if you were buying at 14 fucking bucks, you're a dumb ape, but yeah.

I'm fucking going to ride my options to a fucking profit margin that compensates me for the shit they pulled, or to a GUH. No in between. The Stock Buyback middle finger is just the fucking sweetener.

Matt Daddy, and I, and all the people who everyone called bag holders are going to skull fuck the shorters harder than they skull fucked UWMC's share price. They're going to fucking Guh their way into a fucking shoebox. Fuck em. I want me tendies well cooked, a side of fries, and a foot massage. And their going to give it to me. And to all of you who bought, and are buying UWMC.

They did it with blockbuster but they were more vocal about it, and in turn their stock price plummeted for 4 years because the people found out what they did after they went under and hiked prices by 60%. *but that was soon forgotten*

The two stocks that they projected would gain the most are listed below. 
- FuelCell Energy (FCEL) 
- iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN) 
These two are predicted to skyrocket under the Biden administration due to his push for renewable energy, especially if the Green New Deal is passed.

The setup is a symmetrical triangle. Normally when continuation patterns come from downside - they have a bearish bias. However - we broke that red trendline  with an uptick in volume - this was a hint we were ready for an actual reversal. That trendline kept us in a downtrend for about 4 months. Not only that but...

**TODAY WE BROKE THE SYMMETRICAL TRIANGLE UP - WHICH MEANS ITS FULL SPEED AHEAD!**

Confluence between technicals generate the best signals.

This is the best the setup has looked since GME was at 10. Price target for this is 231.52 resistance initially, followed by 348.50. Breakout is invalid and play is dead if we get a daily close back under 158.11.

And... that's it.

I've been trading for a long time and only use patterns, trendlines & volume. Keep it simple. You don't need to waste 100 hours doing 15 paragraphs of DD for one swing trade - or look at 100 different indicators cherry picking the ones that say your position will go up.

***TL;DR*** \- GME actually looks good for once from an **unbiased** technical standpoint

***EDIT:*** Clarification - I wasn't speaking for GME as a whole when I said it was dead under 158.11 - I simply meant this setup in particular was no longer valid. It could always form a new one. I chose that level because it's the most significant one below the breakout point.

$CNK is AMCs largest competitor and is in the great business we know as movie theaters. When AMC last went crazy, CNK ran up over 56% in a few days from 22-27 of January to $27+. In the past month, AMC is up over 50%. CNK is roughly even. It is lagging behind and is due for a major pop on this AMC craze. It is a classically more boring stock that takes a big nudge to move.

Breaking out similar to AMC. Insanely strong volume shelf in low 20s (high demand) and above 1D 21MA. RSI has lots of room to run. 

**MARGIN**

CNK has a much lower implied volatility and actually allows for margin borrowing. This could be attractive depending on your risk appetite

**DILUTION/FINANCIALS**

CNK has almost no share dilution since the pandemic started, and it has been historically stronger than AMC from a traditional (retarded) financial perspective. AMCs market value growth has passed CNKs by many multiples over the past year. No reason she can't get some love.

His $TSLA puts are generating the most interest from the media, but the position that stuck out most to me is his puts on $TLT, the 20-year treasury bond etf. It makes sense, if inflation really is upon us, the fed will have to raise rates soon. Higher rates = lower price per bond = lower $TLT. This seems way too intuitive and I feel like an idiot for not thinking of it a month ago, but obviously that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not Dr. Burry. I‚Äôm sure he got in a while ago and is already up a bunch of money, but I feel like there are still gains to be made in this trade in the months ahead.

The reason I‚Äôm posting is that $TLT has already come down a fair amount in the past month, but this still seems like an easy money play on inflation. Is there something I‚Äôm missing or is it really that simple? The 13F for Scion Asset Management doesn‚Äôt detail the strike price or expiration for the puts, but I‚Äôm thinking about going in for a few 1/21/22 $125 puts on $TLT.

They've even written some insightful pieces which panned out as per the analyses; CVNA (link below) performed well in the short-term as predicted, but the majority shareholder and CEO sold practically all of his shares four days ago, al in line with their poor long-term outlook.

A lot of the theorising focuses on the founding year of the company. Look... the profile on Bloomberg is for a different Glacier Capital LLC. There appear to be quite a few Glacier Capital LLCs. In the US, LLC names are not unique on a federal level. Unrelated companies in different states can have exactly the same name.

When we consider that the CEO of *the* Glacier Capital was still a university student in 2005, we can safely conclude this isn't a smoking gun and it's likely we're tripping up over unrelated companies.

Look at the dates. When the whole GME surge was first kicking off, Glacier Capital filed to register for a 'Legal Entity Identifier' (LEI) in order to comply with 'Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II' (MiFID II), which was a tightening of regulations within the EU in 2008. LEIs are required in order to comply with MiFID II, and MiFID II needs to be complied with in order to carry out certain high risk activities, including forms/scales of derivatives.

I am not a European financial services lawyer but considering the timing of everything, it seems reasonable to assume that the short positions may be real - and if new certs were put in place just for one series of positions, then it isn't crazy to think they might be especially large.

Again, *I am not saying* that this isn't an incestuous industry or that the capital isn't coming from known players. I am specifically begging you not to be a fucking dumbfuck because of one Reddit-cum-Sherlock post so that whatever dumbass decision you make next is at least a little less erratic.

If you read those footnotes, you can see that some judges on the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (which is 7 very qualified federal judges) have recused themselves and others have had to renounce their claims (normal for judges) against the defendants to even participate, as they would have been members of the several putative actions.

1.**The Fed will cap yields and do whatever it takes to support the economy and markets‚Äîi.e., much more dollar printing.**

**Let me dig in !**

The recent NFIB survey suggests we are only in an economic recovery, not an expansion.

NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

üì∑

Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *‚Äúactually‚Äù* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *‚Äúdemand‚Äù* meets its operating cash flows.

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ew6w5tu19vz61.png?width=804&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bba4677ec15d513e78d6d19644722b133068a48

Businesses understand that the stimulus [***‚Äúpulled forward‚Äù***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)

much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***‚Äúcosts‚Äù*** **of** ***‚Äúlong-term employment‚Äù*** **for a** ***‚Äúshort-term‚Äù*** **artificial economic boost.**

The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.**¬†Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0bcfon349vz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=89b498f76db582407f08e593e10dc5692e6005f2

 

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive. Therefore **Fed will cap yields and do whatever it takes to support the economy , employment and markets.**

At the risk of repeating myself, the risk to the upside in the 30-Year yield is capped somewhere between 2.75-3.00%,

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w1cuikh69vz61.png?width=836&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b01f66a5badd3fc80e79abecd97096e309324a5

 

2. **Inflation will rise dramatically, and the risk is that it‚Äôll be worse than expected:**

We finally got ‚Äúofficial‚Äù confirmation in May that inflation has already begun to take off:

The headline CPI year-over-year increase at 4.2% was the highest since 2008. Energy prices rose 25% and gas prices 50%. Rising energy prices filter through to almost everything. Used car and truck prices were up 21%. Rents rose 2.1%. If you substitute home prices for rents, that number more than doubled.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1qccmij89vz61.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7c72ce894c8a9cddbf6a739715174d69d093229

 On top of all that, the CPI is widely understood to dramatically understate inflation, so the increases are much worse than the headline numbers. As I like to say, one just has to look at the performance of commodity futures over the past year, or go to Home Depot or the grocery store. It‚Äôs not rocket science. This will continue until the monetary and fiscal stimulus stops, small and medium-sized businesses return, and employment rises significantly. Don‚Äôt hold your breath, 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fjw00bba9vz61.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=a09d8f5b80ba4ea16d4fe02b812aa64a15ff8c3c

 

The month-over-month increases were far higher than expected, double in the case of the headline PPI. These are the prices that filter through to consumer prices over time‚Äîi.e., the CPI is likely going even higher.¬†

If that were not enough, wage inflation is on the rise, too, as employers struggle to get people off the couch who can otherwise live on their stimulus checks. Checks that are unlikely to be inflation indexed. Several States have already begun or are considering a ‚Äúreturn to work bonus‚Äù in order to get people to go back to work.

""Therefore I assume inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside .""

Conclusion and Goals :

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

The scenario to play out in weeks in precious Metals ;

 

Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and Gold and the metals soar.Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields.I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks.

Gold & silver's monthly defined 2021 road map still intact. Q2 and Q4 belong to silver, while gold will shine in Q3. For Silver q2 /2021 my targets are 42 Usd /ozz while gold 1.900 Usd/ozz .

The 7.50c line held strong and the stock kept the Friday gains and pushed a bit more.

UWMC is obviously picking up some steam here on Reddit with spillover into many other stock-related platforms (yahoo, twits, alpha, etc). That chatter will certainly help continue the push.

Up some change in Pre-market for what it's worth but should only get better throughout the day.

This is a powder keg ready to go as soon as the 9c's go in the money. If we can exercise at 7.50 and 9 (EXERCISE FRIDAY 5/21 IF YOU CAN FRONT THE Cash!!!).

I suggest exercising even if you are 0.01$ ITM.

The Volume 05/17 was impressive at 17M (8M average) so there is certainly upwards pressure due to buying volume.

Another 2 days like yesterday and those 9c start printing, then it is really off the races and not messing with 8,10% and instead watching a serious gap UP.

Hopes some powder was saved for the push to 9c . I will be buying a few more shares today once some other options are sold for liquidity.

Position:  
I am loaded up on 6/18 8c and LEAPS. I still really like UWMC long-term but this short-term profit potential is simply staggering.

UWMC looks really good for breaking 9 by Thursday, we already have the 7.50c's ready to print from the push last week, then it's TO THE MOON as those options are exercised. 9c needs to hit this week to hit 12-14 (minimum) next week.

LETS GET FUCKING PAID!

This small squeeze isn't the real squeeze and people should hold. The stock by itself with changing over to a e-commerce model should be valued much higher than where it currently is anyways.

UWMC is ready to pop!

I was in UWMC for the value play. It is a STEAL at 10$ on fundamentals anything below that is an insane deal. Even above 10 has a strong long-term argument.

Here is UWMC in a nutshell: heavily shorted, borrow costs skyrocketing, mortgage industry hit overly hard on fears of rising interest rates, the CEO Ishiba announces a 300M stock buyback, and shorts are QUAKING. UP 6% in premarket following being up 1-2% Friday. This puts at starting at $8 Monday with $9 being a CRITICAL Friday target for us.

All UWMC needs is a little unexpected retail buying pressure and it POPS! In truth this is not just a short squeeze, its multiple plays rolled into one. We have retail buying hype train going (obviously, look at all the WSB posts here posted below), short-squeeze due to high cost of borrow, Gamma squeeze due to the MASSIVE options interest, 300M stock buyback by CEO to scare off the shorts, an unfair post-earnings plunge, plus good-ole\` company doing good things (making money).

We coming back for some of our loyal bagholders that have been holding UWMC since the last train to $14, hey guys remember to take profit this time ;)

It is now cost-prohibitive to use more shorts to keep the price low. The normal dirty tricks triple in price so become less-used. Shorts use this borrow price to determine feasibility and 93% is obviously unfeasible, THEY WILL COVER. Once one group starts covering and causes a spike, other shorts will rush to do the same.

It's a prisoner's dilemma and HF's want to cut each other's throats just as much as ours. Let's let them!!!

Many of these 7.50,9. 10, and 12 are OTM or barely ITM. and an early week spike to put 9c ITM would force MM's to hedge to delta-neutral...further pushing 10c and 12.50 c into hedge territory. This can quickly cause things to spiral out of control for shorts.

Stock BuyBack,

Ishbia is going to war with the shorts and his weapon of choice is a 300M stock buyback (similar to RKT's special dividend for the same purpose). The buyback could have started happening as early as May 11th.

Most of the float is owned by institutions and insiders so this buyback puts increased pressure of a heavily shorted (13%+) and heavily held float pool.

Retail is gorging on the float, institutions are holding the float, and Ishbia is buying the free float up. This is a recipe for ROCKET FUEL. WIth shorts paying 93%, they will stop shorting so the shares we are buying are REAL, not synthetic.

Make them buy real shares, from us, at 20$ each.

I am in UWMC for the long-term VALUE-PLAY and like the stock. I like the company., I like the CEO. I like the market position. I like the value. I ilke the stock.

I am loading up on 6/18 8c options. Options are important as we move up to force MM's to buy to remain market neutral.

Options do not pay unless we buy shares, so I suggest splitting half/half to each. options can cause MM's to balance risk and lead to large upswings but this cannot happen without buying pressure and the underlying spiking to necessitate balancing risk, which means we need to buy stocks as well.

Options are good for Gamma Squeeze/MM's balance buys (and profit) but shares are needed to keep the underlying JOOSED and keep those options deep ITM.

MIX IT UP!

This is the final call for the UWMC tendie train so get your fucking tickets and remember; Gravy costs extra,

8576,,2021-05-17 13:20:55,t3_neg3ey,,wallstreetbets,"$UWMC has become one of the most hyped stocks in the online investment community. Online activity appears to be ramping up after earnings and heading into May 21st option expiries. Since UWM is getting a lot of new eyes, it seemed like an appropriate time to share why some investors may consider UWM as a long term hold. 

UWM is a mortgage company that focuses exclusively on the broker channel. It‚Äôs the largest wholesale mortgage provider in the US and the second largest mortgage originator, behind Rocket Companies. 

It‚Äôs CEO is Mat Ishbia, who started as it‚Äôs 12th employee and who‚Äôs dad, Jeff, started the company as a side hustle. Mat and his brother own 94% of the company in Class D shares. The rest of the public float, \~100m Class A shares, are what is available for the public to purchase. 

# What trends are pushing $UWMC‚Äôs stock down? 

**The largest threat UWM is facing is raising interest rates**: 

About 75% of UWM income is related to refinance activity. The pandemic pushed rates to historic lows so most consumers were better off refinancing. Millions have done that, leading to record profit for mortgage providers like UWM and Rocket. 

**The strength of the broker channel:**

UWM is completely dependent on brokers finding business and closing loans. It doesn‚Äôt have any direct-to-consumer lending operations like Rocket does. 

**Short Interest:** 

Sophisticated investors are seeing 75% of income potentially attached to rate sensitive products (not all refi‚Äôs are rate sensitive like cash out), and are salivating. They think the market is under appreciating this headwind and shorting the stock. They have basically shorted all the shares they can. Friday the stock ended with 200 shares available and an insane 93% borrow rate. 

**SPAC:**

It is true that the SPAC market has softened recently. It is very reasonable to assume $UWMC is a part of that softening. It may not attract institutional investors because of the SPAC situation and the short period it has been publicly traded. Lots of other nice places to put institutional money.

**Competitors:** Mortgages are a mature market and competition is fierce. Rocket, LoanDepot and UWM mentioned a pricing war in their earnings. (LD statement). This will compress loan sale margins in the short term. 

**What trends are pushing $UWMC stock up?** 

**Short term retail pressure:**

there is a lot of retail attention on the potential short squeeze/gamma squeeze you could see this week in UWMC. My post is about UWM‚Äôs long term perspective, so I‚Äôll let [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ndcm0p/uwmc_is_a_powderkeg_low_float_high_short_huge/) take you further down that rabbit hole. Additionally, smart money is now tracking online sentiment, which can lead to increased institutional purchases. 

**Broker Channel Growth:** Mat has claimed two reasons for taking UWM public. He wanted access to the liquidity market and marketing exposure for the broker channel. For UWM to become the largest mortgage originator, Mat has targeted ‚Öì mortgages to be originated by brokers and UWM to own 50% of that channel by 2025/26. Currently UWM owns 36% of the broker channel with brokers originating 20% of all mortgages. Before the housing crisis in 2008, brokers were 58% of mortgage originations (Per Mat & Q1 2021 Earnings call), so it isn‚Äôt crazy to think they could get back to ‚Öì as it is growing: [https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum](https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum)

I had a loan with Rocket and tried to refinance with them. I then went through a mortgage broker and got the same loan for $4.5k cheaper in closing costs. This is because Rocket‚Äôs retail channel has 4% margins and it‚Äôs partnership network (includes wholesale, realtors, etc.) has 1% margins. 

**New Product Offerings:** 

UWM recently released new products like their jumbo loan. In earnings, Mat said he expects $2b in volume from Jumbo. They also added ARM‚Äôs, manufactured homes and expanded government programs. 

**Wholesale mortgage provider consolidation:** 

Mat said 3 of the top 25 wholesale lenders have been purchased in the last 90 days. This type of consolidation happens in mature markets by companies that are reaching for market share. THis could be a sign companies are under pressure to grow but cannot organically get market share from UWM. 

**UWM ‚ÄúAll In‚Äù Ultimatum:** 

Rocket and Fairway are priortizing other channels (cause the margins are so much higher) and trying to squeeze out brokers. UWM said if you work with those two, don‚Äôt work for us. The goal was to stand up for the broker channel WHILE putting some pressure on Rocket and Fairway‚Äôs partnership channel. This may have kickstarted the pricing war. 

**Aggressive Capital returns:** 

UWM pays an annual .40 dividend on its class A shares. That only costs them \~$42m/year. Remember their Q1 net income was $800m+. So their dividends hardly affect the balance sheet. The board just approved a $300/million share buyback as well that will reduce share count. Mat knows a thing or two about shorting stocks. He just sold at $10 and has authority to buy back with the current price under $8. The man successfully shorted his own company. What a legend. 

**Long Term Prediction:** 

I‚Äôm invested in UWM because I believe the capital returns will be aggressive during the upswing and the company will remain profitable in a downturn. With a 5%+ dividend return, share buyback, and \*potentially\* growing market share, UWM could be primed to overtake Rocket within the next few years.

8580,,2021-05-17 14:45:52,t3_nei5qk,,wallstreetbets,"As the cloud & big data continues to grow, as well as social media & 4k/8k video, data storage is becoming more important than ever.

Large social media sites take in a tremendous amount of data each day. This storage must not only be stored, but stored with redundancy as well as backups. Major sites such as Facebook and YouTube keep content that is over a decade old. Over time, the drives holding this content will fail and need to be replaced, leading to growing recurring demand as the size of the platform grows.

The need for storage has been growing for decades, but innovation in storage density and intense competition has limited profitability in the market in the past. That being said, there is reason to believe that the growth in storage density may stop keeping up with the growth in storage needs.

There is also reason to believe that transient growth in storage demand may drive higher Q2 earnings. A new digital currency, Chia, has gobbled up about 6 Exabytes worth of storage in the past 3 weeks, now growing at a rate of about 0.4 EiB per day(and rising). https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/netspace

For reference, about 288 Exabytes worth of hard drives were shipped in Q1 2021 https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hdd-shipments-in-q1-2021

Chia network size can be considered a lagging indicator for unexpected drive shipments. Generally, it can take a few weeks between when a drive is purchased and when it's actually accounted for on the network, as it takes time for it to be shipped, set up, and plotted. Chia wasn't even listed on exchanges until a couple weeks ago, so most of the growth seen is prior to Chia even having a price. At current prices, mining is incredibly profitable, with a $500 14 TB drive estimated to produce about $26 per day, and using very little power. So even if the network grows 10x to 60 Exabytes, it's still producing $3/day at current prices. So expect the surge in demand to continue.

I have seen many anecdotes of drive shortages over the past couple weeks. Reviewing sites like Amazon, I have also seen high capacity drives go out of stock or require lead times of a few weeks.

This may be a bit reminiscent of GPU shortages among Nvidia and AMD as miners seek to buy up anything they can.

If we project continued growth at 0.4 Exabytes a day in unexpected demand from proof of storage over the next 40 days, plus the 6 Exabytes added since April 20(leaving out first 3 weeks in quarter as they were likely logged last quarter), that's about 22 Exabytes to be added in Q2 that are not part of normal usage, or about an extra ~8% of Q1 demand.

What's perhaps most interesting is the impact this could have on margins. Unlike the GPUs used to mine which are consumer devices, the devices used for mining Chia includes enterprise grade hardware. Prices in the drive market are more flexible at the manufacturer level, and currently have much lower margins. If proof of storage currencies cause a drive shortage, it could have a significant impact on margins. Western digital sells about 40% of its drives through distributors, Seagate about 30%. Sales through these channels generally are very responsive to demand trends in terms of prices.

Seagate is also in a position to profit from this, but I'm a bit more worried about them as hard drive shipments have been on a long term decline and they aren't diversified into SSDs/flash like Western Digital is.

8585,,2021-05-17 16:06:02,t3_nek6rk,,wallstreetbets,"Hi all, going to keep this short as there is already some great DD on Myovant Sciences out there on Reddit and some recent articles, plus I‚Äôm not a financial advisor.

The EMA (EU medical agency like FDA) announced Myovant and Relugolix as up for review to be accepted for Marketing approval in the EU this week. This is a huge catalyst in the biotech industry, and due to their Pfizer partnership this could result in a 50m cash payment to Myovant as well.

They also have an FDA PDUFA deadline of June 1 for a second application (their first of three was approved in December). If approved this would result in a 100m cash payment from Pfizer.

Alone, these are major catalysts. Right now they stand to go back to back on these catalysts. The last time the company had one catalyst like this, **they were rocketed past $30 a share and gained a strategic partnership from Pfizer.**

Now those are two major catalysts within two weeks, **if FDA decides early, both could happen this week.**

Due to the triple threat data put up in clinical trials and the fact that they had this data peer reviewed and published in the New England journal of medicine, there is strong confidence of approval on the company‚Äôs end.

Last but not least, they have additional catalysts still inbound after. Including Part D and Medicare coverage expected by July 1. All encompassed with a possible buyout from sumitomo.

If you're looking for a good article that covers the basics, you can search the below. Theres also some great posts on reddit and stock twits. I am also happy to answer any questions.

*Why The Misunderstood Pfizer Deal Makes Myovant A Great Low-Risk Investment*

**Quick list of upcoming catalysts:**

THIS WEEK: EMA meets to possibly approve sale of orgovyx in Europe

By June 1: Deadline for FDA approval for a second use case (this could come early and will result in another 100m cash payment from Pfizer)

By July 1: Part d and Medicare coverage: also supposed to be obtained before July 1 for prostate cancer application

Pfizer optionality: Pfizer can opt in to have the rights to sell this in some markets, resulting in a 50m cash payment and royalties paid to myovant. Submission of relugolix for the treatment of endometriosis to the FDA

Catalysts that could happen at any time:  **BUYOUT** from Sumitomo ( aka Sumitovant) or other interested partner (See Urovant history. Sumi has a patent cliff in 2023 they are trying to patch with acquisitions, has purchased 4 of movants sister companies and already owns 53.5% of myovant).

Strategic acquisition of new drug candidates to further myovants pipeline.

**TLDR:**

EU and FDA approvals for drug candidates are expected within the next 2 weeks and could propel this to the moon.

It sounds like an impossibility, but there are simple ways to reading a price chart that enable you to come very close to predicting the direction and turning points of a stock. One of the most important ways is through the identification and marking of channel line patterns.

&#x200B;

[ Prices respect the channel lines ](https://preview.redd.it/fqzpk486qpz61.png?width=1067&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5b02809e77b0f9d4f8162cd558a98154a5aad8e)

Channels lines are one of the most important patterns found on a price chart. They enable you to find the broader trend, or overall direction prices are heading, which is crucial towards choosing the direction of your trade. Sticking with the trend - going long on an uptrend and short on a downtrend - aligns you with the higher probability direction, already setting yourself up for a probable trade.

They also enable you to anticipate and profit from areas where the price has a high likelihood of reversing through a ""bounce"" - where prices hit an upper or lower side of the channel and bounce off of the level like a ball, and heading into the opposite direction. These are key areas because unlike a random point in the chart, a channel line presents a point that has a higher probability of doing one thing over another - *this is an example of where ""edge"" comes from - finding scenarios where one outcome is more likely than the other, and betting on it.*

&#x200B;

[ Channel line pattern with bounces circled ](https://preview.redd.it/f0l668a7qpz61.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=658f753348044acec2cceeaa1dfbf4c6288ae0ff)

## How do you define a channel pattern?

A channel line pattern exists when prices are moving between two parallel trendlines. A trendline is a straight line drawn to connect several major turning points, or swings, in the price chart. When there are two identifiable trendlines that are parallel to each other forming a straight band, prices are *trading within a channel*.

&#x200B;

[ A trendline drawn off of the highs ](https://preview.redd.it/fcfpptc8qpz61.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc81911e78d6e9ee5012760fc53e05f6200513b2)

Trendlines and channels are drawings that highlight the foundational concept of understanding price charts - support and resistance. Support is a level that lies underneath the current price that historically has acted as a cushion for prices, slowing their momentum or causing them to turn right around. Resistance is a level that lies above the current price that historically has acted as a barrier for prices, slowing their momentum or causing a reversal. In this way, support and resistance are one and the same - they are levels that ""support"" or ""resist"", keeping prices within their confines until they lose their power.

&#x200B;

>Prices will often ""test"" support and resistance multiple times and the level will successfully hold, creating areas with a high probability of a bounce - therefore creating trading opportunities.

## How to Draw Channel Lines

So, trendlines connect two or more support or resistance zones, which are areas where prices reversed or showed slowing momentum. Channels are two parallel trendlines. With that, *how can you draw a channel line on a price chart*?

The first consideration is if there is a channel at all. Often, there are ample opportunities to draw trendlines - straight lines connecting s/r. However, it is less often that the chart shows another parallel trendline that price has interacted with. Thus, a textbook ""channel"" with prices neatly filling in the space and bouncing off of the lines is not as easy as it seems to find - **this actually makes the pattern more important, as the discovery of a true channel pattern can lead to very clean bounces and high probability, low risk trades.**

To draw a channel, first find a trendline. Connect important swing lows or highs, and try to find a way to draw a line that connects two or more of the swings, while keeping all of of the other price movement between the swings above the line.

&#x200B;

[ First trendline duplicated and dragged to mark swing lows ](https://preview.redd.it/ss3uggaaqpz61.png?width=561&format=png&auto=webp&s=56e6198235392485a05edaddc3f8d0da4d802d4c)

>A trendline is only as significant as the prices' respect for it - there is no validity to drawing a trendline that connects two swings, while is broken by three other spikes.

Once you've found the trendline, either duplicate the trendline you have just drawn, or if using a channel drawing tool, simply drag the parallel line to see if it can connect two more swings on the opposite side of the price movement.

It takes *a lot* of practice to begin to properly draw channel lines that are valid and are respected by prices. Drawing channel patterns that match historical price charts is hard - and drawing them in a way that can successfully anticipate *future* price movements is even more of a learned skill. This can only be improved by practicing drawing channels on many different charts.

## Types of Channel Lines

The direction of channel lines determine the type of channel pattern. A channel pointed at an upward sloping angle signals an uptrend. A channel pointed at a downward angle signals a downtrend. A channel with a horizontal slope signals a range.

&#x200B;

[ Uptrend ](https://preview.redd.it/s8h4o1xbqpz61.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=1df032e442d4dddf112e30748baedcff16656291)

A concept that is helpful in the identification of a channel's direction is the presence of swing highs and lows. If prices are making higher swings high (peaks) and higher swings low (troughs), chances are they are in an uptrend. If prices are making lower highs and lower lows, they are likely in a downtrend. If there are equal or mismatching swing lows and highs, and prices look more horizontal, a range is likely in play.

&#x200B;

[ Downtrend with channel break ](https://preview.redd.it/wovf3mvcqpz61.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0029bb3d64ea2cb1da1b122a2e477cd0ce827d)

In a trending market, sticking with the direction of the trend can put you on the higher probability side. Combined with an entry identified by the channel lines, this can form the basis of a trading strategy.

In a ranging market, where prices are simply bouncing between two horizontal support and resistance trendlines, any time prices approach or touch the channel lines can be a significant reversal area, where there is a higher probability of a bounce than a breakout through the line.

&#x200B;

[Range](https://preview.redd.it/6z1kj65eqpz61.png?width=1019&format=png&auto=webp&s=3196922b3ddd01cd806ca9f100aa01918bf0b766)

## The Midline and Channel Pattern Breaks

Many channel drawing tools can display a midline, or a line 50% away from both trendlines. This line can serve as an important secondary trendline or support/resistance zone, and often prices react to the midline in a less apparent, but still significant way. Additionally, sometimes prices will break the channel line and form a new high outside of the channel. When this happens, the broken trendline can sometimes become the midline of a wider channel that incorporates the new swing.

&#x200B;

[ Upper channel line turned into midline after breakout ](https://preview.redd.it/wz5gw1peqpz61.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=68d55d124e5799ccc86ac01d5f860786ef24d183)

*When prices break a channel line, it is a sign that the pattern is losing validity.* The trend may be losing steam or accelerating, based on if it breaks the lower or the upper line. A channel line pattern is most valid when there are no price breaks of the trendlines. When prices break the countertrend side (the lower line in an uptrend or the upper line in a downtrend), you can anticipate a reversal soon. When prices break the with-trend side, the trend has accelerated, and you may need to redraw your channel line. This can also be seen as an expenditure of momentum which can bring a trend channel back into a range or a reversal.

## How to Trade With Channel Lines

Because channel line patterns offer areas that have *a higher probability of moving in one direction over the other*, trading strategies can be formed around the pattern. After identifying a valid channel, a strategy may look to buy or sell as price touches the with-trend channel line, setting a stop loss level based on volatility, Fibonacci extensions, or a selection of indicators that can identify momentum and turning points. A take profit level could be determined by a significant support/resistance level, Fibonacci retracements, or indicators similar to those used in stop placement.

&#x200B;

[ A channel bounce trade with \>2:1 risk:reward ](https://preview.redd.it/f24xyxqfqpz61.png?width=1521&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae05a98cdfdfcfb19552fbff3bbb2b5b4331ba7a)

The key advantage to trading channel bounces is the **high risk to reward** offered. A tight stop loss can allow for a high R:R ratio even with a high probability, modest profit target level. Thus, the strategy utilizes *a high probability turning point, a tight stop loss, and a modest profit target* which culminates into a trading plan with a healthy win rate and risk to reward ratio.

Finally, an overlooked aspect of using channels:

&#x200B;

>Channel line patterns have one final key importance to trading - they let you know when to not be in. This helps to reinforce a golden rule of trading - only look to enter trades when there is a higher probability of one thing happening over the other. By watching your channel lines, you'll know when it's there.

&#x200B;

[ Channels force you to be patient and wait for the turning points ](https://preview.redd.it/d3asavogqpz61.png?width=1063&format=png&auto=webp&s=42024fd0d87b9df76edf37e8c33df58b4675684c)

8592,,2021-05-17 17:38:52,t3_nemlpe,,wallstreetbets,"So right now, the mainstream narrative is that inflation is going to run red hot mostly due to a rally in commodity prices. This inflation has the potential to be more than transitory, meaning it lasts more than a couple of quarters at most and will result in forcing the FED to raise rates and crash growth stocks. This is why tech stocks are underperforming while value, or more specifically, manufacturing and mining companies outperform (look at XME for example).

My question is if that is the case, then why are steel futures for U.S. Midwest Domestic Hot-Rolled Coil Steel going down [CME Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/ferrous/hrc-steel_quotes_globex.html)? Right now they peak in June at $1,520 a tonne before steadily going down for the foreseeable future.

Similar things can be said about other commodities such as copper, which remains relatively steady before gradually going down going into next year [Copper Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/base/copper_quotes_globex.html).

On the agriculture side, major commodities like corn appear to be peaking in the near future as well [Corn Futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/grain-and-oilseed/corn_quotes_globex.html).

So taking all of this into account, it would appear that the shape of the futures curves would indicate that commodity prices would peak in near future before gradually going down as supply meets demand. Shouldn't this mean that inflation is indeed transitory as the FED predicts? What am I missing here?

**Tl;Dr:** Futures are showing commodity prices going down in the near future which should drag down inflation rates. Are inflation fears misplaced?",nemlpe,Are Commodity Futures Going Against The Mainstream Inflation Narrative?

It's no secret that companies hire teams of people to brainstorm, draft, and send tweets, but even with the millions of dollars spent on this process it is rare for corporate twitter accounts to have big spikes in followers. Wendy's can obviously tweet some witty stuff that will get lots of likes and retweets, but this usually doesn't motivate most people to sign up for extra ads on their timeline by actually following these accounts.

Wingstop, however, cracked the code on Wednesday by denying the presence of ejaculate in their special white sauce. On Wednesday, one customer tweeted ""wingstop ranch gotta have nut in it no way it‚Äôs just that good"" to which Wingstop replied ""it's a special white sauce but it does not contain \[nut\]""

The rest of the conversation did not contain any more trade secrets on the Wingstop recipe, but it was notable in its own way.

I rarely ever see companies with hundreds of thousands of followers (Wingstop has over 200k) receive over a 5% increase in Twitter followers over a week. Wingstop had a 10% gain in a matter of days.

The market seemingly reacted with disappointment to the lack of bodily fluids in the secret recipe as $WING fell 2% in the day following the exchange.",nerobc,"Wingstop ($WING) has 11% growth in Twitter followers, 3% drop in stock price after denying that their special white sauce contains human ejaculate"

8620,,2021-05-17 21:46:48,t3_nesw0u,,wallstreetbets,"Hey Guys, it's me again. I think you guys may remember me, after all I wrote an extensive series of DD over a month on UWMC through its trials and tribulations, in anticipation of it's breakout moment. You might even remember my YOLO, and remembered I continuously added to it. And that I eventually upped my margin to 13.5k on it. Well, I'm here to tell you that I'm not out. I bought more calls to average down, on earnings day, and I held them when they tanked to ten cents a pop. My only regret is that I didn't buy more then. Though I threw a bit more cash into shares!

Back then, I said the Theta Beta's would regret selling those calls, and it was one of the few plays where there wouldn't be IV Crush. I was right. Their probably a little sour. Sorry chaps, you usually are the one's making money at our expense. This time it's going to have to be the other way around....

Today, I had the chance to exit my options for a 47% profit roughly. Sell calls for a chunky profit after that. I said no. You know why? Because fuck the people who shorted an extremely profitable company to 6.26 dollars, that's why. The Fear, the Uncertainty, and the Doubt people expressed to me regarding this company espoused to me because of the actions of those people gave me an aneurysm. So fuck them. We're playing Pac Man people. The CEO of UWMC is reducing the float, and increasing the percentage of the float that is sold short while increasing buying pressure. We're buying up the stock to get the price to 9-10 because people bought options for 5-10 cents and they'll be in the money quite easily. And because of the rising volume, every day the CEO is able to buy more and more shares thanks to Rule 10B. The delta on the options is low, and they will need to hedge as the price heads steadily upward on Friday. Then the Shorts are going to be squeezed even further as the market makers hedge.

So no, I won't sell my options for a 10 or a 50% profit. I'm going to sell my options at a price I damn well want to. One that compensates me for the trouble that these people have given me. And so should you.

I understand people have taken profits, but honestly, at the price point they were selling at the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. Good for them though. Next time, could you at least sell deep ITM covered calls though lmao.

And for those people on the fucking fence. You jumped onto MVIS, you jumped into GME, and AMC, and all manners of companies that are either unprofitable or make very little money. But the fucking BOOMER stock is where you hesitate the fence?! The fucking (Eyy Lmaooo) Boomer stock, giving you a 4.87% dividend? The one that, if you somehow baghold can give you 10-15% cash returns through divitendies and covered calls until you get assigned at a strike that is profitable to you? The 10-15% backboard cash that can fund all your yolo's? That's the fucking stock you hesitate on? El LMAO. The companies margins will expand hard in a few months, and it's still hugely profitable at a less than 1 percent margin so yeah. Now if you were buying at 14 fucking bucks, you're a dumb ape, but yeah.

I'm fucking going to ride my options to a fucking profit margin that compensates me for the shit they pulled, or to a GUH. No in between. The Stock Buyback middle finger is just the fucking sweetener.

Matt Daddy, and I, and all the people who everyone called bag holders are going to skull fuck the shorters harder than they skull fucked UWMC's share price. They're going to fucking Guh their way into a fucking shoebox. Fuck em. I want me tendies well cooked, a side of fries, and a foot massage. And their going to give it to me. And to all of you who bought, and are buying UWMC.

This is not financial advice, this is a layup. But seriously, i'm not a financial advisor, and you do you with your money.

They did it with blockbuster but they were more vocal about it, and in turn their stock price plummeted for 4 years because the people found out what they did after they went under and hiked prices by 60%. *but that was soon forgotten*

Of course, with any new administration comes a new stock set to explode and others set to fall.

The two stocks that they projected would gain the most are listed below. 
- FuelCell Energy (FCEL) 
- iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN) 
These two are predicted to skyrocket under the Biden administration due to his push for renewable energy, especially if the Green New Deal is passed.

[GME TA](https://preview.redd.it/1tmj448o6sz61.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=1de6593bb253ff2a102250d3e4a97d521e0b3455)

The setup is a symmetrical triangle. Normally when continuation patterns come from downside - they have a bearish bias. However - we broke that red trendline  with an uptick in volume - this was a hint we were ready for an actual reversal. That trendline kept us in a downtrend for about 4 months. Not only that but...

**TODAY WE BROKE THE SYMMETRICAL TRIANGLE UP - WHICH MEANS ITS FULL SPEED AHEAD!**

Confluence between technicals generate the best signals.

This is the best the setup has looked since GME was at 10. Price target for this is 231.52 resistance initially, followed by 348.50. Breakout is invalid and play is dead if we get a daily close back under 158.11.

And... that's it.

I've been trading for a long time and only use patterns, trendlines & volume. Keep it simple. You don't need to waste 100 hours doing 15 paragraphs of DD for one swing trade - or look at 100 different indicators cherry picking the ones that say your position will go up.

***TL;DR*** \- GME actually looks good for once from an **unbiased** technical standpoint

***EDIT:*** Clarification - I wasn't speaking for GME as a whole when I said it was dead under 158.11 - I simply meant this setup in particular was no longer valid. It could always form a new one. I chose that level because it's the most significant one below the breakout point.

$CNK is AMCs largest competitor and is in the great business we know as movie theaters. When AMC last went crazy, CNK ran up over 56% in a few days from 22-27 of January to $27+. In the past month, AMC is up over 50%. CNK is roughly even. It is lagging behind and is due for a major pop on this AMC craze. It is a classically more boring stock that takes a big nudge to move.

Breaking out similar to AMC. Insanely strong volume shelf in low 20s (high demand) and above 1D 21MA. RSI has lots of room to run. 

**MARGIN**

CNK has a much lower implied volatility and actually allows for margin borrowing. This could be attractive depending on your risk appetite

**DILUTION/FINANCIALS**

CNK has almost no share dilution since the pandemic started, and it has been historically stronger than AMC from a traditional (retarded) financial perspective. AMCs market value growth has passed CNKs by many multiples over the past year. No reason she can't get some love.

His $TSLA puts are generating the most interest from the media, but the position that stuck out most to me is his puts on $TLT, the 20-year treasury bond etf. It makes sense, if inflation really is upon us, the fed will have to raise rates soon. Higher rates = lower price per bond = lower $TLT. This seems way too intuitive and I feel like an idiot for not thinking of it a month ago, but obviously that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not Dr. Burry. I‚Äôm sure he got in a while ago and is already up a bunch of money, but I feel like there are still gains to be made in this trade in the months ahead.

The reason I‚Äôm posting is that $TLT has already come down a fair amount in the past month, but this still seems like an easy money play on inflation. Is there something I‚Äôm missing or is it really that simple? The 13F for Scion Asset Management doesn‚Äôt detail the strike price or expiration for the puts, but I‚Äôm thinking about going in for a few 1/21/22 $125 puts on $TLT.

Receiving an MDL assignment is considered very prestigious for a federal judge because it takes so much personal involvement and the cases often affect many, *many* people plus the state of the law more generally.

If you read those footnotes, you can see that some judges on the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (which is 7 very qualified federal judges) have recused themselves and others have had to renounce their claims (normal for judges) against the defendants to even participate, as they would have been members of the several putative actions. Meaning: one or more judges just on this small panel were holding meme stock at the time, if not currently.",nf7s3u,"Legal History: The First Use of the Word ""Meme Stocks"" in a Court Order; Some Judges Admit to Have Held Meme Stock in January"

1.**The Fed will cap yields and do whatever it takes to support the economy and markets‚Äîi.e., much more dollar printing.**

**Let me dig in !**

The recent NFIB survey suggests we are only in an economic recovery, not an expansion.

NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *‚Äúactually‚Äù* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *‚Äúdemand‚Äù* meets its operating cash flows.

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ew6w5tu19vz61.png?width=804&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bba4677ec15d513e78d6d19644722b133068a48

Businesses understand that the stimulus [***‚Äúpulled forward‚Äù***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)

much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***‚Äúcosts‚Äù*** **of** ***‚Äúlong-term employment‚Äù*** **for a** ***‚Äúshort-term‚Äù*** **artificial economic boost.**

The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.**¬†Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0bcfon349vz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=89b498f76db582407f08e593e10dc5692e6005f2

 

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive. Therefore **Fed will cap yields and do whatever it takes to support the economy , employment and markets.**

At the risk of repeating myself, the risk to the upside in the 30-Year yield is capped somewhere between 2.75-3.00%,

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w1cuikh69vz61.png?width=836&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b01f66a5badd3fc80e79abecd97096e309324a5

 

2. **Inflation will rise dramatically, and the risk is that it‚Äôll be worse than expected:**

We finally got ‚Äúofficial‚Äù confirmation in May that inflation has already begun to take off:

The headline CPI year-over-year increase at 4.2% was the highest since 2008. Energy prices rose 25% and gas prices 50%. Rising energy prices filter through to almost everything. Used car and truck prices were up 21%. Rents rose 2.1%. If you substitute home prices for rents, that number more than doubled.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1qccmij89vz61.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7c72ce894c8a9cddbf6a739715174d69d093229

 On top of all that, the CPI is widely understood to dramatically understate inflation, so the increases are much worse than the headline numbers. As I like to say, one just has to look at the performance of commodity futures over the past year, or go to Home Depot or the grocery store. It‚Äôs not rocket science. This will continue until the monetary and fiscal stimulus stops, small and medium-sized businesses return, and employment rises significantly. Don‚Äôt hold your breath, 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fjw00bba9vz61.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=a09d8f5b80ba4ea16d4fe02b812aa64a15ff8c3c

 

The month-over-month increases were far higher than expected, double in the case of the headline PPI. These are the prices that filter through to consumer prices over time‚Äîi.e., the CPI is likely going even higher.¬†

If that were not enough, wage inflation is on the rise, too, as employers struggle to get people off the couch who can otherwise live on their stimulus checks. Checks that are unlikely to be inflation indexed. Several States have already begun or are considering a ‚Äúreturn to work bonus‚Äù in order to get people to go back to work.

""Therefore I assume inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside .""

Conclusion and Goals :

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

The scenario to play out in weeks in precious Metals ;

 

Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and Gold and the metals soar.Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields.I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks.

Gold & silver's monthly defined 2021 road map still intact. Q2 and Q4 belong to silver, while gold will shine in Q3. For Silver q2 /2021 my targets are 42 Usd /ozz while gold 1.900 Usd/ozz .

The 7.50c line held strong and the stock kept the Friday gains and pushed a bit more.

UWMC is obviously picking up some steam here on Reddit with spillover into many other stock-related platforms (yahoo, twits, alpha, etc). That chatter will certainly help continue the push.

Up some change in Pre-market for what it's worth but should only get better throughout the day.

This is a powder keg ready to go as soon as the 9c's go in the money. If we can exercise at 7.50 and 9 (EXERCISE FRIDAY 5/21 IF YOU CAN FRONT THE Cash!!!).

I suggest exercising even if you are 0.01$ ITM.

The Volume 05/17 was impressive at 17M (8M average) so there is certainly upwards pressure due to buying volume.

Another 2 days like yesterday and those 9c start printing, then it is really off the races and not messing with 8,10% and instead watching a serious gap UP.

Hopes some powder was saved for the push to 9c . I will be buying a few more shares today once some other options are sold for liquidity.

Position:  
I am loaded up on 6/18 8c and LEAPS. I still really like UWMC long-term but this short-term profit potential is simply staggering.

UWMC looks really good for breaking 9 by Thursday, we already have the 7.50c's ready to print from the push last week, then it's TO THE MOON as those options are exercised. 9c needs to hit this week to hit 12-14 (minimum) next week.

LETS GET FUCKING PAID!

* Bulls need to keep it above 415
* Look for some resistance around 417-418
* Major residences at 420
* Bears need to. hold 417-418 and then plow through 415 support
* Bullish pt: 419.29 - 420 - 421.20 - 422.71

* Tested bottom range of gap fill for support.
* If it fails we may see the second half of the w-shape recovery form. We could see a few days of downside if we close below 415 IMO.

Is it never beneficial to have a trade surplus with someone than others (comparative advantage, etc.)? I see a lot of people thinking in the ""surplus"" terms with no room for movement - that approach seems rigid and ignorant of valid trade considerations. That's all. 

I don't think China has influence over smaller nations due to our trade surpluses. I think they have quite an agenda of their own on that front. I don't disagree that if the world stopped trading with China they would hurt and be less able to overreach.

The already extensive list of lawsuits against him will dramatically increase as tolerance for his fraud becomes unbearable. 

The board of SpaceX will force him out and start to pursue sensible business practices with their already amazing Falcon rockets instead of the idiotic ""I'm an alien!"" bubble dreams of this clown. 

He'll lash out and start attacking people to justify his failures, much like someone else has been doing a lot lately.
