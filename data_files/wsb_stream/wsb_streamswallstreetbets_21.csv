Everything looked to have gone off successfully. We are now waiting on the data and craft to be analysed and inspected. This will take a few weeks according to Michael Colglazier.
That being said he had already outlined the test schedule in the earnings zoom call.

1st test flight - may 
2nd crewed flight - June 
3rd flight with R Branson on board late June/July 

4th flight this will be taking the Italian airforce on a training mission (600k a seat) late July


On the run in to the first test flight some possible maintenance issues appeared with the carrier plane White knight 2‚Ä¶. 
This indeed could have gone either way , after 2 weeks inspections it was decided that WK2 did not need to delay testing no maintenance was needed at this point. Scheduled Maintenance will commence in the fall after all tests have been completed.
Upon this news it is my opinion that the testing programme will go ahead as planned.

The market has responded accordingly and the stock is now up from $17-‚Ç¨31

With all these catalysts lined up before the end of the year and commercial operations looming for early 2022 things are looking up for Virgin Galactic.The success of the last test flight the company have now proven tech and concept. 
Also with revenue now coming in Nasa who are conducting micro gravity analysis.
Also international training for military pilots and astronauts.
Commercial flights look imminent.
Space ports planned for around the globe and intercontinental travel looming.

They're under the assumption that 100% of the short interest started shorting at $2-3 share price. In reality, almost all of those short positions have already been closed.

 But they see things like ""AMC HAS 20% SHORT INTEREST"", not understanding that the number changes day to day as people both exit and ENTER short positions. So like yeah 25% of shares are short, but most of those people shorted during the +50% day because they know that the apes are just trying to make a quick buck.

They pretend to have some kind of unity where they just wanna ""stick it to the man"" and make hedge funds lose money. ""Never sell, apes stronger together"" but in reality they're trying to get in a Lambo too. Thats what annoys me the most. This virtue signaling hivemind in public, but secretly trying to be a sneaky boiler-room broker.

Alex Sacerdote is clearly leading the pack; what's even more impressive is that he manages $12 billion dollars, while Kaufman manages $551 million and Wang manages $8.9B. In fact, out of the Top 20 Performing hedge funds, Sacerdote comes in only second to Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management, who has the most assets under management (AUM) of $18 billion.

Whale Rock has a 3-year return of 197.48% as of 3/31/21, and an annualized weighted 3-year return of 43.82%

He has trimmed TSLA, SHOP, PTON, PINS, and CRWD, and has loaded up on AMZN, GOOGL, and FB. No, this isn‚Äôt the end of growth stocks, and I am certainly holding on to mine. However, it may be safe to allocate some capital into proven, cash-generating companies. Stay safe everyone!

Most of it was QE, so an exchange of liabilities for the Fed. How does this *directly* feed through to inflation? Or did you think the Treasury printed literal notes and gave them to people to spend?

>You check lumber prices recently? Or copper? Both doubled or tripled in the past 3 years. Not like the common man uses wood and copper in anything.

You're conflating what should be a temporary spike in prices with sustained increases in the price level. No one denies spikes in certain items have spiked recently, but they are the result of supply bottlenecks since inventories were run down last year (what could possibly be the reason for that hmm?). Lumber futures are already going down [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/commodities/lbs](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/commodities/lbs) , which is what happens when you have lots of unprocessed timber being processed at a faster rate due to the spike in lumber prices.

I don't doubt there's a possibility of a sustained inflation overshoot, but the nature of  higher recent inflation prints is already documented extensively that it's just disheartening to see people scream hyperinflation with prints still affected by last year's 0% for April through June.",,

Also, excuse my inexperience, but just to be sure that I understand what you're saying properly:   


I'll use indexes as benchmarks such as SPY and VOO to compare the returns of my portfolio with these indexes. If my collective return percentage exceeds that of, let's say VOO, I would be winning on my trades. However, if my collective return percentage of my portfolio is behind VOO's return percentage, then I would be lagging behind. But that's not a loss yet, right? Or perhaps it's an indicator that it's time to sell one or more of my stocks, right? I heard that its actually good to invest into some of these indexes and many people have mentioned VOO as well, but looking at the trending chart, it's currently at a peak in regards to its 52 week high and a 5 year trending chart. What are your thoughts? I know it's not good to buy high but based on the trend, I think it's only going to increase as the lockdowns faze out until a possible crash happens (possibly due to inflation, bubble burst, etc.), which by then I think it would be better for me to average down instead and buy more shares when it dips, since it should eventually increase back upwards in the long term, but this is my speculation, sorry if it sounds stupid and highlights my inexperience. Also, when investing into new stocks, are there any indicators that you personally follow?",,

But more importantly, do u need the money now?  Is your current gain ""life changing"" money now?  Money is relative, just like time, for some people $20k is a boat load of cash, for others its pocket change, which is it for u?

I hate to speculate,but in general, I would say if this exceeds all the money u have in savings, cash out.  If u have 4x this amount in the bank, ride the wave as time is on your side...

With the devastating effects of the pandemic and economic downturn, hundreds of thousands of children loiter and live on the streets of the Philippines. We started small, with just 3 kids, feeding them and clothing them. We hope to inspire the rest of the apes and apettes to do good to and for the world.
