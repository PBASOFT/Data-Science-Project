Everyone is talking about how the squeeze didn't even happen and the shorts didn't cover yet. What I don't understand is why wouldn't that be possible? If short interest is 17%, so let's round up to about 100M shares. Today the volume traded was 700M shares. Couldn't 100M of those 700M have been the shorts covering? And if they didn't cover, today alone 700M shares were traded, why would 100M shares bought by shorts cause a squeeze if today 700M were traded?

I have been having this question for awhile, since I noticed the same with GME. In the days preceding January 28th (when GME reached its peak), the combined volume was several times the amount of float. How come the squeeze happened and why did it happen? If the volume was so high, couldn't the shorts have covered in the days preceding that?

I hope this makes sense and I really hope someone will be kind enough to explain a fellow retard who only knows about crayons what this all means.

Everything looked to have gone off successfully. We are now waiting on the data and craft to be analysed and inspected. This will take a few weeks according to Michael Colglazier.
That being said he had already outlined the test schedule in the earnings zoom call.

1st test flight - may 
2nd crewed flight - June 
3rd flight with R Branson on board late June/July 

4th flight this will be taking the Italian airforce on a training mission (600k a seat) late July


On the run in to the first test flight some possible maintenance issues appeared with the carrier plane White knight 2…. 
This indeed could have gone either way , after 2 weeks inspections it was decided that WK2 did not need to delay testing no maintenance was needed at this point. Scheduled Maintenance will commence in the fall after all tests have been completed.
Upon this news it is my opinion that the testing programme will go ahead as planned.

The market has responded accordingly and the stock is now up from $17-€31

With all these catalysts lined up before the end of the year and commercial operations looming for early 2022 things are looking up for Virgin Galactic.The success of the last test flight the company have now proven tech and concept. 
Also with revenue now coming in Nasa who are conducting micro gravity analysis.

The plan includes creating an online ticketing platform by Great British Railways which might have a huge blow on Trainline revenue. However, this platform does not yet exist and will probably take a couple of years to develop. Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed.

In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales.  Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%.

I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time  for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

 -🚀Mexico/US P3 trials and Price outlook 🚀-
Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days probable, end of June worst case) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July-August for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent or close to Moderna.  Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects)  Chart on Contracts nvax has and what future prices/MC is expected to be is down below in the ""DD literature section"" at the bottom



-🚀 Intro to Protein and mRNA type Vaccines🚀 -
Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

             
                           
-🚀Differences how Protein vs.mRNA vaxs work🚀 -
Imagine if the spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize one piece to understand the whole picture it and helps modify your Messenger RNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates it can still recognize the virus. In the mRNA method using one portion of the picture as virus mutates,  it becomes easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine. , that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. .... And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein.



-🚀 Safety, Side Effects, and Adjuvenants  🚀-
 Every vaccine uses what's called an adjuvenant. This basically boosts the vaccines effectiveness. There's different kinds, and every company uses one in their vaccine. Not all are created equal. What makes Nvaxs adjuvenant (called Matrix M) so special its the only plant based (soapbark tree) adjuvenants out there, and is the least irritating. This adjuvenant has been tested on pregnant women in the past and past the flying colors. mRNA adjuvenant vaccines use common molecules found in viruses and bacteria that stimulate our immune system. This approach has not been fully tested on pregnant women long term. One of the most common types that were used in the past were aluminum salts. They were found not to be ""harmful"" but we also didn't know enough about them and how they affect us on a grander scale. A lot of anti-vaxxers are against aluminum salts and giving it to the children. This is why Nvax will be the perfect solution for anti-vaxxers, children and the eldery that want something completely safe. Just using the term plant-based in a vaccine heads a good connotation let alone the stronger protection/immune responce it provides. As far as what the virus is being grown in and Nvax uses a moth based formula. So it's insect and plant-based. Sounds like the Karen's will love this! Ultra safe. 


Adjuvenants work by creating an irritation/inflammation at the injection site, This in turn helps the vaccines be more effective apon administration. This is what makes you feel sore after getting a vaccine and specifically amount of adjuvenate that being used.  NVAX only needs to use 5mM vs  mRNA type vaccines use anywhere from 50 to 100 mM of adjuvenant. Therefore when getting a vaccine from mRNA type vaccines you get a much stronger side effect due to the amount being used. Also this is proof how effective novax is because they need to use so little to be effective hence why they have the best data and we're called a first in class vaccine. In conjunction with how much adjuvenant is being used you can say it basically directly alters the safety profile. Use too much you get too many bad reactions. This is why Nvax has one of the best safety profiles out there. Bottom of my post is a link with a lot of data and that data is included all the side effects of each vaccine charted out to show this.


 Lastly because the amount of ajuvenant used in mRNA type vaccines it can only fit one maybe two strains max before throwing off the safety profile and risking not getting approval.  If they do use two strains they have to use less of both to combine them meaning you're not going to get complete protection for each strain that's in the vaccine.  Nvax does not have this problem because of the such small amount they use, they could combine up to five different strains without an issue.... And right now with it being so clear that covid strains are going to keep mutating we need vaccines thay can cover multiple strains and give full protection on each one. Sometimes one strain can cover multiple strains but depending on where the mutation is if it's a bad mutation you need to address each strain individually and putting them together in one vaccine. Since you can't get four strains in one mRNA vaccine this puts us out at a clear advantage down the road when people need to do booster shots and don't want to get multiple vaccines through the year and don.  So all in all it's clear Nvax adjuvenant separates it from the pack and performs much better then other kinds on Safety, Effectiveness, Coverage of all strains  and convenience of getting less covid vaccines through the year. 


-🚀 Logistics and Storage.🚀 -
Nvax can be stored it in a regular refrigerator, and let it sit out in room temperature for a while while you're vaccinating people instead of a special ultra low temp freeze needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers, this is a majority of the world, not to mention the intricate ways you got to handle it so increases your distribution cost because you need special warehouses, dry ice etc. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

                 
- 🚀 Scientific conclusion 🚀  -
So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines so other protein competitors will be far behind and they will have an a moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing they teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine. They will be combining flu and covid vaccine by 2025 for possibly double the price of current covid vaccine.



 -🚀 Investment Thesis & Financials  🚀-
They are pretty much de-risked at this point vs where they were a year ago. Yes you could buy other  biotechs that can go up 20x but are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up) that has all successful trials done so far, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment to where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place there are no more glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""


They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. Yesterday at market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. 
 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 


Future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract in there ( in the link below in another message). It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 



 -🚀My Positions and Future Price of Nvax🚀 -
As far as my position I own some $200 July calls along with about 933 shares. I'm all in baby.  Been in since $4.06, I panicked and sold once during February a couple months during the mini bear market we had and got back in a bit too early so got a wash sale 🙈 but I'm diamond hands all the way to $800 from here.  LFG  (Check out next link below this paragraph, it has My positions and an amazing DD chart converting contracts to future price and comparing with competitors. My screen name on stovktwits  is the same on there Johnnyknowsbest. Been on there and here since i started with nvax.


Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. This is huge as the combo is going to differentiate them especially since both flu and covid vaccines are first in class

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

Somebody posted this in the Rite Aid sub. Can one of the more astute people here comment on this? Is this a real possibility? 

The news that leaked that Amazon was interested in physical locations makes me wonder, but they’ve had years to buy Rite Aid, CVS or Walgreens. So far they’ve done nothing but Pillpack, which has been mostly a failure. 

So I don’t know what to make of this, is it a real possibility or just BS?",Amazon buying Rite Aid? Will it happen? Or just BS?,,

1) We look to the PTON CFO's statement found in the latest earnings call transcript, for guidance:
""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior.""
2) Being that we do not have access to a 10-K filing for Q4 fiscal '19, we will access other filings that do in fact reference numbers from fiscal '19...
A) 10-K filing dated 9/11/2020
B) 10-Q filing dated 5/6/2020
3) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $223.3M under Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19)
But, that is TOTAL Revenue; we need to find out what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike sales...
4) To calculate what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike Sales, we can use numbers from neighboring Q3 (i.e. Three Months Ended March 31, 2019)...
A) On page 6 of the 10-Q, you will find Revenue of ""Connected Fitness Products"" (aka Bike Sales) to be $261.6M
B) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $316.7M
C) % of Bike Sales per TOTAL Revenue: $261.6M / $316.7M * 100 = 82.6% {""Connected Fitness Products"" Revenue (aka Bike Sales)}
5) Apply 82.6% to the TOTAL Revenue $223.3M for Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19): $223.3M x 0.826 = $184.45M {Bike Sales for Q4 of fiscal '19}
6) Per the CFO, ""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior."":

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote... By mid-July, we’ll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase precious metals  especially silver amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative 

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

Gold rose over 60% in the 1930s as the prices of stocks and real estate crashed. You could buy an entire block with a one ounce gold coin. Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms.

I must address Cramer's statement because he is obviously trying to add fuel to the short-selling fire: When he says ""we're not going natural gas"" he is clearly making a vague and general statement meant to be interpreted in the worst possible way: ""no one is going to buy or use natural gas."" By now, I hope everyone that is interested in this stock understands that CLNE offers an alternative transportation fuel, thus, the investments made by BP and Chevron, and not revolutionary technology like some EV's (but this is mostly hype meant to catapult EVs to the front. What most people do not realize is that driverless technology and such can be placed in Petro vehicles too). Also, unfortunately, the company has done a terrible marketting job. That's why powerful analysts can get away with making vague and unsupported statements. The fact that Cramer explained the stock's decrease over the last month as being due to widespread dissaproval is misleading, at best. Many people do not yet know about the cleanliness and therapeutic effects RNG has on the climate. We must get the word out and pressure CLNE corporate to begin marketting campaigns to get the word out. I think it's about time.",Cramer on CLNE,,

I want to cover two tickers here, $SNDL which currently meets the sidebar rules with today's move. 1.6B market cap and is trading above $1. I get it mods, you gonna mod but I'll keep writing. The other is the infamous $TLRY.   


The News...

If you haven't read yet it looks like Federal Cannabis legalization my be around the corner. [Here](https://www.mpp.org/policy/federal/the-more-act/) is the House Bill. Supporters seem on board and like the reforms they have done to the bill including rescheduling cannabis. [Last time](https://mjbizdaily.com/key-us-house-lawmaker-reintroduces-federal-marijuana-legalization-bill/) the bill was introduced it cleared the House.   


Personally I think this gets a lot of support especially from a fiscal point of view. With stimulus stalling and a giant debate going on about how to pay for the stimulus I think cannabis offers the easiest way to collect federal revenue. A simple review of the bill and the fiscal benefits to the Fed's can be read [here](https://www.justtherealnews.com/congress/nadler-blumenauer-lee-jackson-lee-jeffries-velazquez-reintroduce-comprehensive-marijuana-reform-legislation/). The bill states a 5% fed tax. Money coming for uncle Sam, right when questions about paying for stimulus.... Personally I think it adds up, but that's for you to decide. 

Okay so that's the hype...

Let's talk about the tickers listed ($SNDL and $TLRY). 

$SNDL

I'll start with the cheaper YOLO, $SNDL. $SNDL short interest isn't high, but the company did issue convertible notes a while back around .7c if my memory is correct. I'm not saying they won't do it again, but they should be in a good place fiscally for now. Float is high with about 1.6B shares out there. However today's volume at the time of writing is over 415M. That's not bad given such a high float. It's about 200% more than the average volume. 

The options chain on $SNDL has me giddy. With over 200,000 options currently in the money on todays move above $1 there is some high potential here for some interesting action. The put to call ratio is just obnoxiously low at .08 it's screaming upwards betting. If we hold above $1 the potential squeeze up could be amazing.   


It's also broken up on the trend lines and out of the downward channel it was in. The regression channel from the peak squeeze back in Feb just broke out today according to my crayons I have laying around. 

$TLRY

$TLRY was the squeeze of a lifetime if you remember it back in 19'. The ticker was just a money printer with it's low float and stupid hype. Then they proceeded to do, like they all do, and issue debt. Shares tumbled since then falling from $120 --> $5. Ouch bag holders.   


Like all the cannabis stocks the Feb bump pushed $TLRY to above $60 in an amazing move. $TLRY has a lower short interest than $SNDL, but it also has a much lower float at about 300M. Compared to $SNDL the volume here isn't as good, but still remains decently above the avg volume around 36M as of right now. 

If we peep the options chain we also see a crazy low P/C ratio around .11. But we don't have the Open Interest in the chain like $SNDL does unless you roll out to Jun 18. Then we finally get some decent OI.   


Personally I am going with $SNDL. The option's chain looks better, the stock is cheaper, and the short interest is a little better. My advice would be to roll out till at least the Jun 11th $1 strike to not get eaten alive by Theta and IV crush. But WSB does what WSB wants and that's why I love you all.   
Do not go above the $2 strikes IMO. You will get crushed by theta unless we get an insane move, which could happen but I don't see the risk / reward there.",MORE ACT / CANNABIS / $SNDL & $TLRY Potential,,

>A corner in the silver market has been tried before - and let's be clear, that is what is being attempted now.  In 1980, a rule change by the government destroyed the corner.  #silverthursday.

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday

>Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers’ attempt to corner the market on the metal.

-
>Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926–2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt’s 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers’ Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.

-
>By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged—March 27—silver fell to $10.80, the metal’s biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, “A billion dollars isn’t what it used to be,” the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.

-
>To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978–91) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities.",There is no silver short squeeze happening.

* Henrik Fisker is a God among men in the automotive industry - trust him to do right
* Geeta Gupta-Fisker is a solid Chief Financial Officer with experience in investment banking - she will ensure the shares are valued right
* Henrik has learned from all the mistakes he made with his previous attempt to create Fisker Automotive, and will certainly do everything in his power to avoid that mess again. He has designed systems into the intricacies of the company to avoid failure - meaning Fisker Inc is guaranteed to succeed
* Henrik Fisker on shorting $FSR - “You will quickly understand that you stand to lose a lot of money if you show it against Fisker”
* Production of Fisker Ocean expected to start in November 2022
* 250,000+ units a year expected by 2025
* Partnerships with Foxconn and Magna Steyr, both giants in their respective industries, among others
* Large Fleet market in Europe gaining momentum, and 700+ Fisker reservations in this market alone
* 16,000+ reservations already. More than Tesla had 18 months pre-production
* Revenue streams include leasing automotives, servicing, selling emissions credits, selling insurance (like selling the pickaxe to miners, and selling the diamonds to the mine owners too, absolutely genius - Fisker are insuring cars which they own, because the customer is only leasing it)
* High short interest (20%+), high analyst price targets compared to current share price (100%+) and low valuation compared to peers ($3bn market cap currently)
* Designing the first ever all-electric popemobile - Massive, soon to be historic, event!
* I give $FSR (currently $13 a share) a price target of $100 by end of year 2022, if not sooner
* Price Targets: $35 by end of year - Previous ATH. $50 start of next year - European and Chinese debut of prototypes. $100 end of 2022 - start of production (SOP). $150+ 2023
* 2025 Price Targets, calculated using projected data: Bear case - $97 a share, Bull case - $519 a share
* Downside in the short term is capped by the large amount of cash on hand - one third of market cap is cash. Long term, is capped by risk factors, which are almost eligible and affect every automotive startup anyway.

In 2008, Fisker Automotive raised over $90 million from investors including venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. In September 2009, Fisker Automotive was awarded a $528 million loan guarantee by the United States Department of Energy (DOE). The automaker was one of four recipients of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, to encourage the domestic manufacture of electric cars. The funds were to be used to develop the Karma, as well as an affordable family-size plug-in hybrid car. The loan facility was frozen at $192 million in February 2012, after the DOE claimed that Fisker missed its milestones

In December 2011, just as the Fisker Karma was launched, its battery supplier, A123 Systems, recalled all batteries, followed by a second recall in 2012. A123 filed for bankruptcy in October 2012, leaving Fisker Automotive without a battery supplier. After selling approximately 2,000 units, production of the Fisker Karma was suspended in November 2012, in the absence of its battery supplier.

Henrik Fisker resigned as chairman from Fisker Automotive in March 2013, because of disagreements with management about business strategy. Later that year, the company declared voluntary bankruptcy.Fisker raised and spent more than a billion dollars over its lifetime.The heart of Fisker’s business model was in that early deal with Quantum. The idea was to design a gorgeous car, and have suppliers like Quantum provide the technology because off-the-shelf parts from suppliers would help keep costs down.

But there were problems with this strategy: Sometimes, those parts had to be custom-made to fit the design vision, which resulted in higher prices for Fisker. Other times, parts were delivered late or, worse, faulty, but Fisker was locked in to those supplier relationships. Sources close to Fisker have also said that many of the parts were owned by the suppliers themselves, so Fisker didn’t own a lot of the internal technology.

The broker that raised funds for Fisker automotive, by selling their private shares, was Advanced Equities.It wasn’t until December 2011 and into 2012 that the more dubious efforts of Advanced Equities became clearer to Fisker’s hundreds of investors. The last few hundred million dollars of Advanced Equities’ fund raising for Fisker, starting with the D-1 round, was what brokers call “pay to play.” As Fisker was running into technical, delivery and political problems, its valuation was quickly declining. But the company still needed more money, so the brokers went back to its current investors and said: Unless you give this more, your current shares will be diluted and your preferred stock will be converted to common stock.

It was essentially a gun to their heads. This is why investor Wray sued Fisker in February 2012, alleging he was on the receiving end of this tactic. In his lawsuit, he says Advanced Equities sent him a letter dated Jan. 18, 2012, stating that he needed to decide if he wanted to invest in Fisker’s next round, and pay around $84,000 by Jan. 27, 2012 — a little over a week from receiving the letter. He also says that Advanced Equities assured him that he would have anti-dilution protection. According to the audio clip from Advanced Equities’ internal sales call in early 2010, Advanced Equity leaders say that the Fisker deal will “suffer no dilution,” and was “a dream scenario.”

That dream would soon end. In September 2012 after Fisker closed on $1.2 billion in funding, the bulk of it organized by Advanced Equities, the SEC charged the broker with misleading investors when it raised money for another company back in 2009 and 2010 (Bloom Energy). Advanced settled, agreeing to pay $1 million, and its co-founders were personally fined. Two months later Advanced Equities closed up shop.

Later, A123 Systems itself went bankrupt, causing more problems for Fisker. Fisker claimed that A123 Systems owed it $140 million, but a bankruptcy settlement reduced that to a paltry $15 million.

Then there was the just plain terrible luck for the ironically named Karma: Super Storm Sandy wiped out 338 of its Karmas in storage in New Jersey. The cars first drowned, and then caught on fire — salt water damage caused a short circuit that was spread to other cars by high winds, Fisker said at the time.

With all of this happening in public — and in a presidential election year — Fisker’s struggles became highly politicized. The company was mentioned numerous times in presidential debates and speeches leading up to the election. Republican nominee Romney called Fisker and other DOE-supported companies losers.

The company didn’t seem to invest substantially in technology innovation or tech IP, and seemed to spend a disproportionate amount on suppliers. For example, numerous sources have said that the company paid upfront for 15,000 of some of the parts for its planned 15,000 Karmas. It ended up only selling around 2,000 of the cars. It has also been said that Fisker paid some funds upfront to have BMW make engines for the 100,000 Nina cars it hoped to produce — in the end, Fisker didn’t deliver a single Nina.

Costs to build each Karma also creeped up because the company missed its volume targets, and because engineering had to change designs around supplier constraints. The company ended up adding $20,000 to its initial sale price.

Expensive hires may also have sucked away chunks of Fisker’s funding: Sources say that Fisker filled the upper levels of the company with seasoned auto executives from Detroit. At the high point of Fisker, the company had around 300 employees, plus dozens of contract staff. Bringing in a certain amount of the old guard could help a car startup ramp up quickly, and also impress potential investors with “industry names.” But those people are also used to big auto-industry budgets that included extensive travel and salaries — that’s the opposite life of a tech startup.

## Fisker Inc.

In July 2016, Henrik Fisker expressed interest in designing a fully connected electric car with autonomous driving features and an aesthetically pleasing look. He has pursued battery technology, and hinted at potentially reviving the Fisker name with a pure-electric vehicle using technology that nobody else has. Since then Fisker has talked about delays to the promised solid state battery technology, which he does not expect to be able to be produced in volume until at least 2025. Posing risk for competition from more scientifically experienced future solid state battery producers such as Quantumscape.

***Forbes:*** “Now he’s back–and three things are different. First and foremost, he has a vital new partner: his wife, cofounder and Fisker Inc. CFO Geeta Gupta-Fisker. Second, his Los Angeles-based company is public this time around, raising more than $1 billion in an October 2020 IPO. And finally, Fisker’s stock price, up 56% since its debut, has made both Henrik and Geeta billionaires, each worth about $1.1 billion as of Friday’s market close. The auto industry has seen father-son and sibling leadership teams, but Fisker Inc.’s CEO-CFO combo is the fast-changing sector’s first husband and wife power couple.”

Wealth isn’t the purpose of the new company, Henrik says. “I never got into cars because of money. (This shows he is willing to do what is in the best interest of the company because he is not motivated by money, unlike 99% of other CEO’s)

The couple sought a big stake in the new venture to ensure they can control its fate in a way Fisker couldn’t with his earlier company.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yzhded6pfw171.png?width=408&format=png&auto=webp&s=54b30259720cf853a8efeacf058f2f74315260b9

Henrik is an auto industry celebrity, but Geeta’s background is equally impressive. A native of India, she holds multiple degrees in science, including a Ph.D. in biotechnology from Cambridge University where she was also a Research Newton Fellow. From there, she started a career in international investment for Lloyds Banking Group, and then managed investments for a high-net-worth client for several years. (In particular, this is insanely important - Geeta **KNOWS MONEY**! She knows how best to keep a company afloat, organize its share structure, provide value to shareholders, etc. because she has worked in the industry before. She may just be the most important element of Fisker Inc., due to the financial experience she has. At every step of the way, she is likely to make decisions with one sole focus - increasing share price and value).

She met her future husband in 2011 when he was visiting London, just before things started going very wrong at Fisker Automotive. They married in 2012.

“When I left Fisker Automotive, all I had was my car,” Henrik remembers. “I'm in a different position, mainly because of Geeta. Because she cuts the deals.”

To get the new venture off the ground, the Fiskers invested the majority of their life savings–an enormous financial risk given the fate of Henrik’s prior company. Then, just as they were locking in plans for the IPO back in July, they were hit by a highly unwelcome complication: Geeta learned she had early-stage breast cancer.

“She got the call (from her doctor) during a call with investors,” Henrik says. Despite that bombshell, she continued working with banks and investors in the weeks that followed, even as she underwent two surgical procedures and radiation therapy. Her medical therapy concluded in November.

Henrik, who marvels at her fortitude throughout the health crisis says, “she only missed something like one day of work...That's just how she is. She works tirelessly.”

## Fisker Ocean

The Fisker Ocean will have a nearly 300-mile range with an 80 kWh battery and a solar panel roof as a range extender, adding approximately 1,000 free miles of range per year. Advanced electronics will be housed under the hood, and the vehicle will incorporate recycled and sustainable materials throughout. Deliveries of the Ocean are scheduled to begin in 2022.

&#x200B;

Fisker has also announced a partnership with Electrify America to ensure Fisker Ocean vehicles will integrate seamlessly with Electrify America charging stations when the e-SUV hits the market. With features such as a solar roof and recycled inner materials, it will be, according to Fisker Inc., the ""world's most sustainable vehicle.""

In 2017, Fisker Inc. announced that it had filed patents on flexible solid-state battery designs. Fisker expected the batteries to be produced on a mass scale around 2020. A prototype of the battery debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018. In October 2018, Fisker announced new funding for battery development through Caterpillar Venture Capital. The solid-state batteries are intended to deliver longer vehicle range and faster charging times.

In 2018, Fisker was named to the board of directors of First Cobalt, a North American cobalt refinery that produces battery materials.

In September 2019, it was announced that Fisker Inc. was partnering with Game of Thrones actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who will serve as a partner and sustainability adviser to Fisker, to work on advanced, affordable, electric mobility models.

&#x200B;

[In addition to being a well-known actor, Coster-Waldau is also the United Nations Development Program Goodwill Ambassador for climate change and other social issues.](https://preview.redd.it/3hssff5vfw171.png?width=451&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebe55e2468c5b63d1bc0ac3c71547219dff5afaa)

Nikolaj wrote this piece about Fisker:

To quote a friend of mine who is a lot smarter than me, architect Bjarke Ingels: “The idea that sustainability needs to sacrifice quality of life is a flawed one. It’s a design challenge, a challenge to build something that transforms the idea of sustainability into something that will increase the quality of life for all those around it.”

One person meeting that challenge is Henrik Fisker, who has designed some of the most iconic cars over the past decades for BMW and others, like the BMW Z8, Aston Martin DB9 and Aston Martin V8 Vantage. He’s a hero for gas-guzzling supercars. He is a fellow Dane, I am a fan, and we met, of all places, on Twitter.

When we met in person, he described his new project — an all-electric luxury SUV — and asked me if I would help spread the word on his car. The problem as I see it with most electric cars is that they only accomplish the basics. They get you from point A to B. They run electric so you don’t pollute while driving, but that’s it. They are basically unattractive combustion engine cars that have a battery thrown into them — and for most of them, a battery with a limited range. What Fisker does is to try to make every part of the car in a sustainable and attractive way, like a full-length solar roof, recycled floor mats and vegan leather seats. It looks incredibly cool and inviting, with a great 250- to 300-mile range, and at a cost of just under $40,000, it’s a luxury car affordable to a mass market.

I said yes and even became an investor, not only because it’s a great car but more importantly, I hope and believe it can inspire other companies to actively incorporate sustainability goals into all aspects of their business. Fisker then had the idea of calling me “sustainability” adviser. Which I am not. Just to be clear. Thanks Henrik, sounds cool, but I am an actor and a citizen, and that’s really it.

And what about Hollywood? Is our industry changing, are we at the forefront? Looking at social media, you would think so. And things are happening, but usually only when a camera is pointed at people. Remember a few years back when all awards shows only used EVs for the red carpet? We made a difference. We mattered. We showed the way. So cool. So green, so … brief. Now it’s back to the Escalade. But hey, we are not using plastic straws anymore!

To believe that change will come from Hollywood is not really based in reality (when did that stop us?), but we are great at reacting — and things around us are changing, and changing us. I have a good friend who loves his SUV. It’s not electric. But he cannot give up his car. He is a good guy, he’s works for the U.N., so if he has a problem going electric, we all do. But if he is presented with an alternative that doesn’t mean a reduction in his quality of life, something like the Fisker SUV, I think he’d transition to electric in a heartbeat.

The IPO deal values Fisker Inc at US$2.9 billion, with an IPO share price of $10.

On July 30, 2020, Fisker announced plans for a four-vehicle portfolio by 2025. The Fisker Ocean SUV will be joined by a sports sedan based on their previously announced Fisker Emotion concept, a coupe-like SUV, and a lifestyle pickup truck. All will be electric vehicles.

On October 15, 2020, Fisker Inc announced it would be outsourcing vehicle production of its Fisker Ocean electric SUV to Magna Steyr, to reduce the complexities and costs related to the building and operating its own factory. Magna will start building the Fisker Ocean in Europe in 2022.

## Henrik Fisker Interview quotes:

I have people on Twitter saying, “Why don’t you just make the car next month? You have a prototype.” Most people don’t understand that it takes 18 months to do long-lead body tooling for high-volume vehicles. Most people don’t understand it takes two years to do durability tests and do all the engineering certification and everything else.

And on the business model itself, I believe that there is nobody in the near future or the next couple of years that’s going to make a million EVs on one model. Today, there’s nobody doing it. Tesla probably has the highest volume of one single model, a couple hundred thousand. But even the big giant established carmakers are not making, right now, a couple hundred thousand vehicles of one model. So the way you get volume, in my view, is if you partner up with other OEMs and share some of the expensive parts of the platform, which in my view is not anymore something that is unique IP or something that is a unique experience to the customer. An aluminum stamped floor or a steel stamped floor really doesn’t have any brand value anymore.

And obviously, as we move forward, we always start to do some of the things ourselves. But it was really about de-risking in our first vehicle to market. So we’re going to do another three vehicles, which we can do because we don’t have to spend all our money and effort on learning how to manufacture a car, for instance.

So we have programmed a lot. We have hired a head of ESG, environmental and social governance, and he is really spearheading developing specific... we kind of put out some goals that we would like to reach with suppliers, and we at least try to bring them in that direction. They are not reaching those goals right now, but they may reach them later. And then we have goals for ourselves. So for instance, we look at transport. Are we choosing a supplier that’s closer to the plant, or are we choosing a supplier that’s on the other side of the planet that way we have to then transport all that stuff. So those are the types of things that we’re really thinking about now as we’re nominating suppliers. And finally, materials as well, looking at sustainable materials. We’ve actually picked up a lot of knowledge on that side as well, where we are adding more sustainable materials to our vehicle. So we are actually looking across everything — supply chain, where the suppliers are located, what the suppliers are doing for sustainability, and also then of course in the vehicle itself — in terms of the type of materials there.

So - let's summarize - prices are rising at their fastest pace in almost 30 years and incomes just plunged by their most ever! We're gonna need more stimmies!""  

Plus  to above; 

Last year, Hirschman Capital noted that since 1821, 98% of sovereigns that hit 130% debt/GDP have defaulted on their sovereign debt.   

The US hit 130% late last year. 

Simple Conclussion : The Fed can’t go “hawkish” and raise rates without sending markets –and economies–to their knees; by extension, they now have nothing left to “cut” when the current everything bubble implodes.

And that  is a *real problem*.

 There are only two ways for sovereigns to default: 

Inflation or collapse.    

The latter is not an option. 

 As for a solution, what’s so tragic is that the only option before the Fed is an even bigger problem—current and inevitably more inflation. 

 That is, if the Fed wants to keep markets (and their job security) breathing, they no longer have the foregoing template of “rate-hike-followed-by-rate-cutting” at their disposal, which means they now have no choice but to dovishly keep rates near the zero-bound indefinitely.

But the only way to keep rates “controlled” and nailed to the floor of time is to purchase otherwise unwanted bonds to keep their prices elevated and hence yields and rates repressed.

Such bond “accommodation,” of course, costs money, and as we already know, the only “money” the Fed has to spend is the kind they create out of thin air– the very kind of money (and policy) which leads to the kind of inflation discussed above—namely, the brutal kind.

 As for that fake money, the evidence of the Fed’s desperate (and only) direction is now obvious, as the following M2 money supply makes equally clear. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v774ta55sw171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e73c839beb67a67eea9aed7de4ac61d86813840

 

Fed is so embarrassed by this “printing solution” that they’ve stopped *weekly* reporting of M2 data, and frankly, since March, have even stopped *monthly* reporting of the same.

That, of course, is both telling as well as disgraceful… The Fed literally has something to hide, and that never bodes well, does it?

&#x200B;

 The correlation to central bank balance sheet (i.e., money supply) expansion and rising markets is now beyond dispute. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sgizb6xcsw171.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=aad2fe681fe0c49ac20368aba77e86c118b22959

 In short—do you see the correlation and pattern? Do you see how the Fed’s market sausage is made? More importantly, do you now see the Fed’s self-made conundrum? 

 

Given that the Fed bows to the markets not the people, which choice do you think they’ll make?

In other words, expect more money printing and more yield curve control—and hence more money creation, more inflation, and by extension more fiat currency debasement.

 More money supply to keep rates monetized simply means more currency debasement and rising inflation.","""Fed's ""Favorite"" #Inflation Indicator (PCE) Explodes At Fastest Rate Since 1992 As Incomes Crash By Record""",,

59,2021-05-28 20:45:08,t3_nn76we,nn76we,wallstreetbets,"TLDR:

I have leading indicators telling me that there are two concurrent shifts underway when it comes to who is purchasing homes.

\- Massive increase in unmarried people buying houses alone. This used to be somewhat unusual, now it's becoming very common.

\- Massive increase in unmarried men, in particular, buying houses alone. Traditionally, the female-to-male ratio of unmarried homebuyers was about 5 to 1. For the last 3 months, it's been closer to 50/50.

Source is my own closed real estate purchase transactions. Am a mortgage broker (btw this means cash purchases are ""invisible"" to me). It takes 3-6 months for [HMDA data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Mortgage_Disclosure_Act) to become accessible to journalists and academics, and thus ""visible"" to the general public (assuming journalists deem it worthy of commenting on), but I can see the trends live in real time.

How would one go about placing a bet that in about 3 or 6 months, the media, journalists, academics, etc, will pick up on this, publish articles, and potentially cause a lot of people to buy certain stocks. Which stocks would that be? Is there a ""Mancave, Inc"" out there that would potentially get an uptick? Or maybe a company making smart-home stuff that is particularly suited to renting by the room (the single men are not buying 1 bedroom condos, they are buying proper houses with 3 bedrooms, etc)?

EDIT: oh, and to be clear. It's not just an uptick in single men. It's an uptick in women too, but a massive surge from the men. It used to be that for 15 banana sales, 10 are to married couples, 4 to single women, and 1 to a single man. Now for the same 15 banana sales, it's 6 to married couples, 6 to single women, and 3 to single men, something like that.",Homebuyer Demographics Shift towards single and male. How to bet?,,

It was on a Thursday night 02/25/2021 when I posted, at the time RKT was around 19-20 range and on the following Monday 03/01/2021 it started rallying, by 03/02 & 03/03 it hit the ATH level 43. You’re welcome to find my last DD post for verification. And for those of you who made tendies on it congratulations to you all! Spread the good energy!

As I am writing this post Today is 05/28/2021, I’ll try to bring more data and technical analysis on $RKT, as you all saw what happened yesterday 05/27/2021 around lunch time upon sudden move it went from 17.50 area all the way to 19.40. This move doesn’t seem so random at all, a combination of someone noticed this to be a strategic technical squeeze just testing the water after it being suppressed down for the past 3 months, and you can see how fast the shorts started covering all of a sudden.

Today 05/28/2021, at opening it shot up to $19.20 but the shorts came prepared for $RKT this morning with their analysts and news blasting numerous articles and downgrades from Morgan Stanley, Wedbush & Zacks, ALL AT ONCE. This is certainly no coincidence.

On the technical side, on the daily chart as you can see it has a gap to fill around 22.67 area then it’ll go straight to 28 and has a huge potential to pass beyond that and make it to a new all-time high, there’s nothing stopping it. On the daily MACD closed red and turned green, RSI is at the same level as last time before it squeezed to ATH $43, Parabolic S.A.R indicator flipped from red on the daily to green for the first time in 3 months. Another important factor is as you look at the volume and candle compared to last time it exploded (both red arrows) same volume, same price action.

Conclusion: the shorts are basically scared sh\*tless right now and they know it, is a tickle to the trigger for it to explode again like last time or even higher. Based on Excess Returns Model the fair value for RKT is $85, so why haven't we seen $100 yet?

I am no financial advisor and this is not a recommendation, just knowledge I would like to share.. Heres to Vertex Energy and why I think it won't stop rising in price for the next few days...

First off, we have the $75 million deal to buy the Mobile refinery in Alabama from Royal Dutch Shell PLC which is expected to close by the end of the year, and would be the largest and most significant transaction Vertex has ever completed.

With the additional $85 million conversion of the Mobile refinery's hydrocracking unit, Vertex expects the refinery will have the potential to generate at least $3 billion in annual sales and $400 million of gross profit annually beginning in 2023.

As part of this transaction, Vertex will assume ownership of more than 3 million barrels of crude oil and product storage, together with other valuable logistics assets. Our vision for this site is that of diversification. We will seek to lead the southeast region in marketing next generation fuels and products that are not currently produced by the refinery today.

Vertex will become the sole owner and operator of the refinery upon closing. The refinery, which has a long track record of safe, reliable operations and consistent financial performance, will become Vertex's flagship refining asset upon the close of the transaction, positioning the Company to become a pure-play producer of renewable and conventional products. Highly attractive transaction economics, pro-forma for renewable diesel fuel project.

Still with me? Ok, so...

Vertex expects the average gross profit per barrel on its renewable diesel production will be significantly higher than that of the Mobile refinery's conventional fuels production, including the benefit of tax subsidies and carbon-reduction incentives. As this project involves the conversion of an existing, operating process unit, Vertex anticipates that both the capital cost and anticipated time-to-market will be significantly less than that of comparable greenfield conversion projects.​

Also, here's what Alvaro Ruiz, EVP of Corporate Development at Vertex had to say:

""As part of this transaction, we plan to enter into a multi-year crude supply and product offtake agreements with several highly-respected counterparties, including Shell, who has been an exceptional partner throughout the sale process. We believe these agreements will position us to reduce our working capital requirements, while mitigating spot market risk on product sales. Upon closing, we expect to hedge a significant portion of the first-year production, reducing our near-term exposure to movements in refined product margins, as we focus on completing the planned asset conversion, which remains the most significant near-term economic driver resulting from this transaction.""

BIG NEWS BOYS AND GIRLS​
Most importantè piece of info, right here:⤵️


PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION: Vertex intends to enter into a multi-year product off-take agreement with Shell, while continuing to supply Bunker Holding (""Bunker One"") under an existing 10-year agreement. Under the agreements, Shell and Bunker One will purchase 100% of the Mobile refinery's conventional fuels production. Concurrent with this arrangement, Vertex will enter into a separate, long-term agreement under which Idemitsu Apollo Corporation, a wholly-owned California-based subsidiary of Idemitsu Kosan, will purchase 100% of the Mobile refinery's renewable diesel fuel production. The sale of all conventional and unconventional fuels will be priced against spot market index prices.​

Okay, whew, that was beginning to strain MY eyes.. Here's - to me, the best thing out of all this info and the best for our future as a cleaner environment: 

Renewable diesel is a biofuel that can be produced from organic waste and vegetable oils. Renewable diesel is a sustainable, fungible replacement for petroleum-based diesel fuel. While California remains the primary market for domestically produced renewable diesel, given the economic benefits for its use under the state's Low Carbon Fuel Standard, other states are expected to follow suit, creating significant, incremental demand during the next decade. Once operable, the Mobile refinery's converted hydrocracking unit will be capable of processing a wide range of organic, pre-treated feedstocks, including soybean and corn oil, meat tallow and waste vegetable oils, among others.​
 
Thanks for your time.

&#x200B;

\*\*\* If you aren't in TSM ( ***Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing***) you hate money. Here are some reasons you should look into this stock and buy it before it is too late. \*\*\*

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Economics 101, Supply and Demand.**

* TSM is the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the world
* THERE IS A WORLDWIDE SEMICONDUCTOR SHORTAGE
* Let me emphasize this point. THERE IS A WORLDWIDE SEMICONDUCTOR SHORTAGE

As many of you know, there is a worldwide semiconductor shortage (yes I said it again). These semiconductors are vital components in every electronic we use today. Without these semiconductors, things like smartphones, automobiles, video game consoles, etc. Would not be able to function.

(Read the following if you want to see why these semiconductors are so vital...or just completely trust me, that's fine too)

***\*ALL COMPUTERS NEEDS SEMICONDUCTORS TO FUNCTION\****

Semiconductors are used primarily in electronic devices, including chips, diodes, transistors, and integrated circuits. Anything that is computerized or uses radio waves depends on semiconductors. Your phone is a computer, your car is a computer, your video game consoles are computers, your amazon firestick is a computer, every aspect of your life is dependent on these semiconductors.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do you believe the future of automobiles are powered by electric? Not without semiconductors.

**Semiconductors in Automobiles**

1. **Vehicle electrification –** Semiconductors have made it possible to replace manual systems with electrical systems. Electrification of key systems provides benefits such as increased vehicle efficiency, reductions in carbon emissions, and minimizing oil dependency.
2. **Safety and driver assistance –** The increasing need for better safety and driver assistance systems in cars has provided a niche for semiconductors. Intelligent functions such as backup cameras, blind-spot detection, adaptive cruise control, lane change assist, airbag deployment, and emergency braking systems are all made possible through the integration of semiconductor technologies.
3. **Connectivity –** Cars are increasingly incorporating technology that improves their connectivity. New vehicles on the market include ever-more sophisticated telematics (long-distance data transmission) and infotainment capabilities which feed drivers information on factors such as road closures, collision avoidance, and even free parking spaces at their destination. On-board computers which handle this information have to process millions of lines of code every second. Semiconductors allow cars to stay connected in real-time.

Semiconductors are key to the future of the electric vehicle (EV) industry as they help to control the powertrain and battery. Semiconductors are also used in the variety of touchscreens that are installed in the driver’s dash and in the back of passenger seats.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**FINANCIALS/NEWS**

* Financially, the company has reported its third straight quarter of record sales in its first-quarter earnings report back in April.
* Its revenue came in 25.4% higher year-over-year to 12.9 billion.
* The stock has more than doubled in price over the past year
* Japan’s government recently announced that it wants TSM and Sony to invest $9.2 billion to build the country’s first 20-nanometer chip plant.
* Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) said on Friday (5/21/2021) that it has increased its 2021 output for a key component for automotive semiconductors by 60% compared with last year, amid a global chip shortage.

These are just a couple of things. If This has caught your eye please research TSM on your own and you can find more great news and financial statements...or don't, you've made it this far, might as well go all in.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 31st, 2021.

# **A big jobs report looms in the week ahead, as markets enter the often-weak month of June - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/28/jobs-report-looms-in-the-week-ahead-as-markets-enter-the-often-weak-month-of-june.html)**
*****
> May’s employment report is the big event in the week ahead, as stocks enter the often weak month of June. Stocks are finishing May with a mixed performance. Big cap indexes like the S&P 500 and Dow notched gains. The S&P rose a half percent, and the Dow rose 1.9%. The small cap Russell 2000 was flat, up 0.1%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq declined 1.5%.
*****
> June is not historically a strong month for stocks. Bespoke Investment Group points out that over the past 50 years, the Dow has gained just 0.12% in June and has been positive 52% of the time.
*****
> But over the past 20 years, June was far weaker, gaining only 40% of the time. June’s performance is tied with September as the worst month of the year, with an average Dow decline of 0.7%, according to Bespoke.
*****
> The economy is front and center in the coming week with the important ISM readings on manufacturing and services sector activity, but the most important measure will be Friday’s jobs report. According to Dow Jones, economists expect Friday’s employment report to show the creation of about 674,000 jobs in May, after the disappointing 266,000 jobs added in April. That was about a quarter of what economists had expected.
*****
> “You know if we have two months in a row of not delivering on the jobs expectations, the market is going to get nervous,” said George Goncalves, head of U.S. macro strategy at MUFG. “Hopefully, we beat it and then that creates a positive buzz, and we go into the Fed meeting and then we’re, ‘Hey, the economy is still on track.’”
*****
> # Big June event
> The Fed meets June 15-16, and already market pros are anticipating it will be the most important event of the month. Fed officials have emphasized that they will keep policy easy as they watch to see signs that the economy is really healing. They also contend that higher inflation readings are temporary, since the data is being compared with a weak period last year.
*****
> Key for the markets is whether the Fed begins to believe that inflation is higher than it expected or that the economy is strengthening enough to progress without so much monetary support. Fed officials have said they would consider discussing tapering back on their quantitative easing bond purchase program if they see signs of improvement, and that would be a first step toward interest rate hikes, not expected until at least 2023.
*****
> If inflation runs too hot, the Fed’s main weapon to combat it is to raise interest rates.
*****
> The prospect of higher interest rates makes the stock market nervous, since it would mean higher costs for companies and less liquidity. In theory, higher interest rates also means that investors could potentially choose higher-yielding bond investments over stocks.
*****
> The next big read for the economy is Friday’s jobs report, and it looms large as recent inflation readings have come in much hotter than expected. The latest was the personal consumption expenditures price index Friday. It showed core inflation running at 3.1% year over year, the strongest reading for that measure since 1992.
*****
> The Fed’s beige book on the economy is expected Wednesday. ISM manufacturing data is expected Tuesday, and ISM services is released Thursday. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks on central banks and climate change at Green Swan 2021 global virtual conference Friday.
*****
> # Inflation flare-up
> The Fed has said it would tolerate an average range of inflation around its 2% target until it sees inflation sticking at a higher level. Inflation has been running mostly below 2%, prior to the latest numbers.
*****
> “With the PCE number coming in like every other inflation number over the last six weeks, hotter than expected, the market is inching closer to calling the Fed out on its view that inflation is transitory,” said Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy at BTIG.
*****
> Emanuel said the speculative activity around meme stocks this week is a sign of froth and shows a large amount of liquidity in the hands of investors. One of those stocks, AMC, closed off 1.5% on Friday after rallying 116% in the past week, giving it a 2021 gain of 1,200%.
*****
> “The net net on the index level is basically it’s a stock market that’s moving sideways,” Emanuel said. “Our view continues to be that when you look at it longer term, the big picture is this is a bull market that started in March of last year that has further to run. When you look at it in the medium term, the market has every right to be concerned and we do believe they will amp up their concern that the Fed’s paying insufficient attention to price stability.”
*****
> Emanuel said he studied what happened to stocks when core PCE was above the Fed’s 2% target. “The average monthly return for months where the core PCE has been over 2%, going back to 1989 is (a decline) of 1.6%, with a decided bias toward more defensive sectors like health care outperforming and a very pronounced bias for technology of all kinds to underperform,” he said.
*****
> Technology stocks, as measured by the S&P information technology sector, gained 1.6% in the past month, and are up 5.9% year to date. The sector is lagging the S&P 500′s 12% gain.
*****
> The top-performing sectors have been cyclical year to date, with energy up 36.2%, financials up 28.5%, materials up 20.1% and industrials up 18.3%. Communications services, which contains some internet growth names, gained 16% since the start of the year. Health care has been outperforming information technology, up 8.6% year to date.
*****
> In the past week, the S&P 500 gained 1.2% to 4,204 and is within 1% of its all-time high. The Dow rose 0.9% to 34,529, and the Nasdaq was up 2% at 13,748.
*****
> # Red flag?
On the edges of the financial markets, market pros are paying attention to signs of a huge surge of liquidity in the financial system. In the past week, institutions have been placing unprecedented amounts of cash with the Fed, nearly a half trillion dollars Thursday.
*****
> “There’s way too much liquidity in the system, and it’s happening as a result of the Fed’s ongoing QE, but also disbursements from the fiscal stimulus,” said Goncalves.
*****
> He said the funds from trillions in stimulus, including to state and local governments, have not yet been spent but have found their way into the banking system. At the same time, institutions and individuals continue to move funds into money market funds, now holding about $4.6 trillion.
*****
> Those funds also put pressure on the system, since they put funds in Treasury bills. Goncalves expects the Fed to raise rates on excess reserves if the situation gets worse.
*****
> “There’s no precedent for this because it is totally a function of there being just too much money in the system,” he said.
*****
> “Institutions are redepositing cash at the Fed because they don’t have enough bills or short-term commercial paper. There’s not enough fixed income assets to go around,” said Goncalves. He said banks also do not want to hold the excess cash since it counts against their leverage ratio, and they would prefer to find other higher-yielding investments.
*****
> What it has done is sparked some speculation that the Fed would taper its QE program sooner than expected, he said.

> # Days After Memorial Day Improving

> Our office will be closed for observance of Memorial Day on Monday, May 31, 2021. U.S stock and bond markets will also be closed. As you spend some quality time off please consider taking time to commemorate those who have paid the ultimate price while serving in the U.S. military. Additionally, consider taking a moment to acknowledge first responders, nurses, doctors, law enforcement, firefighters, essential workers, scientists and everyone else that has tirelessly worked and sacrificed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

> For decades the Stock Trader’s Almanac has been tracking and monitoring the market’s performance around holidays. The trading day after Memorial Day has a mixed record going back to 1971. Both S&P 500 and NASDAQ have declined more often than risen on the day, but average performance is still modestly positive.

> Since 1986, the frequency of gains has improved, and average performance has also risen however, but S&P 500 declined five straight days after 2015-2019. The second trading day after Memorial Day has more advances than declines, but average performance is negative for NASDAQ. The third day after appears to have the best long- and short-term record combined with solid average performance.

> # Post-Election-Year June: Third Worst S&P 500 Month

> June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks over the last 50 years as a rule ranking sixth with a 0.9% average gain, up 28 of 50 years. This contributes to NASDAQ’s “Best Eight Months” which ends in June. June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.2%. S&P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking ninth, but essentially flat (0.1% average gain). Small caps also tend to fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.8% in the month since 1979.

> In post-election years since 1953, June still ranks poorly and its average loss for DJIA increases to –1.1% while S&P 500′s modestly positive performance becomes a 0.6% loss. DJIA struggles the most, advancing in just four post-election year Junes (1977, 1985, 1997 and 2017). Russell 2000 fares best, up seven times in ten years with an average gain of 1.2%. NASDAQ lands in the middle, advancing 50% of the time with an average gain of 0.4%.

> In terms of whether economic data is either beating or missing economists’ forecasts, it appears conditions may now be a bit better overseas. Driven by some improving COVID-19 trends, the economic backdrop has improved overseas, while high economic expectations have proved to be a more formidable hurdle here in the U.S. This improvement has helped to steady the foundation in many non-U.S. equity markets, and has caused us to improve our outlook for developed non-U.S. stocks. We believe the improving COVID-19 trends in Europe could be particularly sticky as vaccine distribution becomes more widespread.

> For several years now, being underweight European equities, relative to the U.S., has been a winning trade. A sea-change in that thinking could be approaching as value-heavy European indices have gotten some attention with the improvement from value, but a firm, constructive view of European equities may still be some ways off.

> The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index, or CESI, tracks how the economic data fare compared with expectations. The index rises when economic data exceeds Bloomberg consensus estimates and falls when data is below forecasts. As shown in the LPL Chart of the day, economically, global conditions remain rather strong, as evidenced by these indices, which remain above the zero line. This reflects economic data coming in better than expected in several geographic regions. The repair of global trade activity, as supply lines are reconnected, has been notably key in non-U.S. data outcomes.

> Looking ahead, we expect now elevated economic expectations, particularly in the U.S., may prove a tougher target. As a result “economic surprises,” both in the U.S. and abroad, may fade as we move through the year. However, the overall global growth trajectory is expected to continue to be robust through 2021. Global real GDP contracted 3.3% in 2020, and it is expected to rise to +6.0% in 2021, according to Bloomberg’s consensus estimate, before ticking down to +3.4% in 2022.

> “Although high U.S. economic expectations could be tough to beat for the remainder of 2021, we still believe U.S. stocks should make up a material portion of equity portfolios. And even though economic expectations are being more readily exceeded overseas, it is tough to overlook U.S. companies’ innovation and profitability advantages.” explained LPL Financial Director of Research Marc Zabicki.

> # More and More Investors Are Looking For A Correction

> The S&P 500 has been hovering around 0.5% below its record highs this week, but without a true test of those highs, sentiment has not moved very far. The American Association of Individual Investors' weekly reading on bullish sentiment fell from 37% last week down to 36.4%. While that is the second week in a row with an absolute move less than a full percentage point in size, the marginally lower reading does leave bullish sentiment at the lowest level since the end of October.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052721-AAII-Bull.png))**

> Bearish sentiment moved by even less, only rising 0.1 percentage points. At 26.4%, it still is below the reading of 27% from the first week of the month. Outside of that reading, that is the highest level since February.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052721-AAII-Bear.png))**

> This week's moves left the bull-bear spread little changed at 10. That's down 0.7 points from last week but still above the 9.5 reading from two weeks ago.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052721-AAII-BB-Spread.png))**

> Once again, the highest percentage of investors are in the neutral camp at 37.1%. As was the case last week, that makes for the highest level in neutral sentiment since the first week of 2020 when it stood north of 40%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052721-AAII-Neut.png))**

> Pivoting over to sentiment for equity newsletter writers measured in the Investors Intelligence survey, there were some more interesting moves. Bullish and bearish sentiments were not necessarily anything to gawk at similar to the AAII survey. Bullish sentiment has been on the decline with this week's survey showing a 3 percentage point drop to 51.5%, the lowest level since March 10th. Meanwhile, bearish sentiment moderated from 17.2 to 16.8%. That was the same level as the start of the month.

> The percentage of respondents ""looking for a correction"" was more notable. Rather than simply asking whether or not respondents foresee a correction in the technical sense on the horizon (a 10% decline from a high), Investors Intelligence defines a newsletter writer as ""looking for a correction"" when they are bullish on a list of stocks but at a lower price point. Coming in at 31.7%, the reading is a few percentage points above the historical average of 27.6% and is in the top quartile of the historical range. In other words, it is an elevated reading albeit far from without precedence. What is more significant is that it has been over a year since this part of the survey has seen these levels.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052721-II-Correction.png))**

> In the history of the survey dating back to 1963, there have only been eight other times that the percentage of newsletter writers looking for a correction has crossed above 30% for the first time in at least a year. The most recent of these was in April 2009. In the table below we show the S&P 500's performance in the year following those occurrences. As shown, performance has been generally positive across those past instances with average gains over the following weeks and months and moves higher at least 75% of the time one month, three months, and one year out. Additionally, while there were two times, 1982 and 2009, in which the S&P 500 rallied over the following year without looking back, there were another two times, 2001 and 2007, that at the following years' lows, the S&P 500 would end up lower by double-digit percentage points.

**TL;DR  BEAR CASE: OXY HAS DOGSHIT FOR A BALANCESHEET AND THIS MAY KEEP  INVESTORS AWAY REGARDLESS OF EVERYTHING IT HAS GOING FOR IT DUE TO  CURRENT MARKET UNCERTAINTY AND GENERAL OIL FUD, POTENTIALLY  OPEC/RUSSIA/WHATEVER HANDLES THE UNLIKELY POSSIBILITY OF LIFTED IRANIAN  SANCTIONS POORLY AND CRASHES OIL PRICES**

**TL;DR  BULL CASE: OXY HAS DOGSHIT FOR A BALANCESHEET AND THUS INVESTOR FEAR  HAS LEFT THE STOCK SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERVALUED WITH MODERATE IMMEDIATE  UPSIDE (1-2 weeks, $26 > $31) AND 2-3x POTENTIAL BY END OF YEAR,  BEING ONE OF THE COMPANIES BEST POSITIONED TO PROFIT OFF THE PRESENT AND  NAVIGATE THE FUTURE OF THE OIL INDUSTRY**

We  live in oily times. This has been the case since the dawn of the  petroleum industry; it is the lifeblood of the world, almost quite  literally, and our first fears of oil were that we would drain the  planet dry. Now, consensus is shifting towards the real issue with  reliance upon fossil fuels - if we keep up as we have been, we will end  all life on the planet in quite a different way. Climate change is real,  and the mainstream narrative has finally caught up - with covid slowly  fading away, and an era of relative peace (apart from the middle east  exploding as usual and china slowly buying the world), it is going to  become the hottest topic on our plates and people are going to be  feeling very angry about the prime culprits, big oil. This has already  started, last week, with the first strikes hitting Shell and Exxon, and I  have absolutely no doubt that similar incidents will continue to sweep  across the industry, especially once we hit full reopening and the media  needs its next big fix of drama. For those invested or who are  considering investing in the oil industry, we live in uncertain times,  but again, we live in oily times. I truly believe that the energy/oil  sector will fully recover from COVID and begin to absolutely take off  over the next few years, but not without a significant degree of  turbulence regarding oil companies. This will not be based around  fundamentals, but fear. For this reason, I feel that Occidental  Petroleum is the best positioned company to weather the potential media  circus, profit off the rising prices of oil and make absolute bank as  they begin to shift into carbon capture, which is what I believe to be  the future of oil companies in an attempt to remain carbon neutral  without massive restructuring and countless stranded assets. Much of  what I'm saying will apply to many small-midcap petroleum companies, but  I like OXY the most - and I love the technical setup, which I can't say  for other strong candidates like Devon Energy (DVN)

**SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

Oil  players cutting production without a meaningful reduction in demand is  massively bullish for oil. The lower the supply, the higher the demand,  and thus the higher the price of any given commodity. If the oil  industry is forced to restrict oil extraction, the first companies on  the block for being strong armed into lowering production are going to  be the supermajors. OXY is not a supermajor, and has already lowered  production/plans to keep production lowered this year (and leaned out  significantly, as they are now profitable at around $30bbl if I read  correctly). Therefore, reduced production from the supermajors in a  sector that is already likely to hit a supply crunch sometime this year  is bullish for all small-midcap oil producers, and although they have  seen good quarterly results, many of them are yet to recover to  pre-covid levels.

**TECHNICALS**

I'm  still too poor to afford crayons, but the long and short of it is this:  On March 5th 2021, oil closed at $66.27bbl. OXY was valued at $31.23  per share. On May 28th 2021, oil closed at $66.66bbl. Aside from this  being very bullish for Satan - the price of OXY at close was $25.96.  This, to me, makes no sense at all, given that OXY could be considered  as a highly levered company regarding oil prices. The price of oil did  not spike as rapidly as it did in March, but right now it feels to be in  a very clear uptrend, and has demonstrated a level of stability that  March did not. Moreso, OXY posted strong earnings and an EPS beat, but  they have been unable to recover recent highs, and pre-covid highs still  seem to be a distant dream, though entirely realistic within my eyes.  To me, this lack of positive price action is purely because of FUD -  people aren't sure what to make of oil right now, because they're smooth  brained retards. The bottom line is the bottom line; OXY and friends  are making big bucks, and the more restrictions the industry as a whole  finds itself slapped with, the higher the cost of oil, which leads to  greater benefit for small-medium players. Or, potentially, bankruptcy,  but I think OXY's investment in carbon capture is their silver bullet  which will give them safe haven and even greater appeal in the face of  future uncertainty.

**CARBON CAPTURE**

OXY  has significant interest in carbon capture. This is sort of beyond the  scope of this DD, but essentially, carbon capture is used to sequester  carbon - and in this case, this captured carbon is used to pump more oil  out of the ground. I personally believe it's going to be an incredibly  helpful and possibly even necessary technology, and I think if  restrictions do pass in regards to oil drilling, it's going to come also  in the form of regulations mandating an amount of carbon capture per  output. I'm aware that there's quite a lot of debate regarding the  actual usefulness of carbon capture, but it has clear and undeniable  benefit in oil drilling and regardless: governments throw money at  nonsense all the time, and even if it is ultimately an ineffective  method I believe that carbon capture is likely to see significant  interest and investment. It is entirely possible that OXY becomes an  industry leader in this respect, and it would mark a ridiculously  lucrative pivot when combined with their current position in oil. This  could easily see them reaching the ranks of the supermajors, if these  companies are unable to keep up with the current state of change and can  find no appropriate pivot themselves.

THE SHORT TERM PLAY

**The  price of oil has been inching towards testing 5 year highs over the  past week, having pushed past 52w highs on the Friday but closing lower  on the day. I believe this is for a single reason, one which will have  resolved by the 1st of June. We're currently in a long weekend with an  OPEC meeting on Tuesday, and the Iranian oil sanction FUD is still  weighing heavily on the market. Thus, it would have been foolish to buy  into a stock position over the last few days when next week will give  much greater clarity - hence why a number of oil equities have remained  somewhat flat compared to similar price action in March - since it is  not entirely clear in which direction oil prices will go right now and a  lot can change over a long weekend into an OPEC meeting.**

**Personally,  I believe that oil prices will go right the fuck up. OPEC is unlikely  to deviate from their plan, and will very likely talk on how they would  handle the potential reintroduction of Iranian oil to the market. This,  coming off of the memorial day weekend being a psychological marker that  things are ""back to normal"", with the weeks following being  historically bullish for the market in general, the current concerns on  inflation, the stories on oil majors cutting back production and the  ongoing tensions in the middle east makes me think we see oil cross  $68bbl by next week and, without a significant pullback, $70bbl by mid  June.**

**Therefore,  the play is simple. Check oil price movement immediately following the  OPEC meeting on Tuesday, and if it's stable or moving up, buy July 9th  OXY calls at a $28 strike - my price target being $33. So long as oil  doesn't crash back below $65, I have no doubt that OXY will retrace to  at least $30 by July 9th, which is a comfortable 100% profit at current  prices - I also expect an IV bump following OPEC, as there should be  some large buys as funds rush to reposition themselves in oil stocks  once the FUD clears. A few of the stocks in this sector - OXY and RIG in  particular - are quite prone to posting 10% to 15% green days out of  nowhere, and OXY is well overdue for one. Overall, these stocks have  been lagging in confidence compared to March, even with more stable  price action and higher highs - I expect a correction to the upside very  soon.**

THE LONG TERM PLAY

In the unlikely even that oil tanks after the OPEC meeting, we move to long term - buy OXY calls or shares at *whatever price they've dipped to the next time oil is around $58-$60bb*l,  because that feels like a historically strong level of support and  should hold even stronger given the current monetary environment. As  long as oil is above $55bbl, OXY is sitting in a pretty profitable  space, so a significant drop in price if oil drops to around the $60bbl  mark would indicate the stock being oversold compared to fundamentals,  and it's likely to pop back up around the Q2/Q3 earnings.

Buy  and hold for 5-10 years and I see a relatively safe 3-5x. Boomer shit,  and I bet they'll even up their dividend by then, but I think 2023 calls  are a bit unpredictable - 2022 are likely to print, I like $40s, but  things might get choppy past then. Still, even with their level of debt,  I don't see OXY as among the companies that may go under during the  coming massive shifts in the oil industry, and I believe that they will  be debt free within a few years and successfully pivot to carbon capture  and make a new name for themselves there. Potentially literally, given  that Total is now TotalEnergies, and Petroleum is going to go the way of  the gamer word.

**BEAR CASE**

There's  really not much here to be bearish about; it depends on the price  movement of oil and investor sentiment about large debtors. Personally I  believe that OXY will have a significantly cleaner balance sheet by end  of year, and given some stability in the price of oil above $60bbl I  think most investors will come around to that fact, too, but given the  general uncertainty in the market - strangely absent this week, as it  was overall bullish - OXY is not the safest investment, and the smart  money required to move the needle on an established and ""problem"" large  cap significantly might be absent for a few years yet, until some  definite stability and repayment of debt is found.

Also,  OXY did some potentially really stupid shit hedging oil prices and  their profits are capped at oil being $75bbl. Personally, I think this  is fine, as I see oil capping out at around $75bbl for the year, but  expect OXY stock price to hit a ceiling around there if crude does  breach $75 this year. At which point, I would advise either DVN or RIG  as they have much more room to run in a significant oil bull market.

Thanks for reading, if you have.

Good  luck to all; this is one of the ideas I have been more confident on  this year, and since I have made a fair bit of money off of various DDs  shared here (and I fucking hate what this place has become by the way,  but shout out to steel gang), I have wanted to give back in some way.","The state (and future) of oil, an OXY - Occidental Petroleum - trade idea.",,

I’ll give my view also. Especially where I differ. 

Always starts with team. This team is top. Went through their LinkedIn pages and all of them are all stars. That’s seems like a great place to start. 

FINTECH
Not to mention they just got Jackie Reese from Square $SQ recently took over and looks like Wish could be a big #Fintech play with 100m users. They launched buy now and pay later recently. 

Also Palantir cofounder is on the board and CEO is one of the early Google search engine technologists. 

53k! LOCAL MERCHANTS- SOMETHING NO OTHER COMPANY HAS
They recently launched Wish Local. They partner with local merchants to sell goods in the local communities but using their app as the online face. 53k are on the platform. This allows them to deliver goods same day, buy online pick up same day, and Wish Express that is 5 days or less shipping. This also brings in traffic to merchants. So everyone is winning. 


30% OF MARKET CAP IS CASH NO DEBT
They trade at 1x sales. Grew it over 50%. 

LOGISTICS ON FIRE
This revenue is on fire. Growing over 2x and they mentioned this will soon make profit. They said they are offering to companies NOT selling on Wish. They just started this effort. This means someone selling on Shopify or other marketplaces can sell globally using their network. Not really possible before. 

Obviously there’s risks but it also seems like the risks have come down dramatically with share decline. 

Not only this. Short interest is high and I think reason for selling is private funds selling shares after lockup.",Time to make a WISH,,

&#x200B;

Just want to share some charts and information that I noticed while comparing AMC and GME before the squeeze

&#x200B;

So as you all know, this past week has been one for the books for AMC, from it's low on Monday, May 24th we witnessed an increase of 201% on AMC. Now this got me thinking and made me want to look back at the history of how GME started to move before it's squeeze.

&#x200B;

If you look at the candles closely, they are very very alot alike

&#x200B;

1. GME's breakout candle, on Thursday, January 13th and AMC's breakout candle, on Wednesday, May 13th are almost identical
2. After both breakouts, they traded above the bollinger bands for 3 back to back sessions
3. After GME's breakout, we saw a consolidation of price action for 5 trading sessions
4. After AMC's breakout we saw a consolidation of price action for 7 trading sessions
5. From GME's low on it's initial breakout to it's high the Friday before the squeeze, we saw on increase of 283%
6. From AMC's low on it's initial breakout to it's high the Friday before the potential squeeze, we saw an increase of 245%

&#x200B;

This is where things get interesting...

&#x200B;

The bullish candle that was formed for GME on Friday, January 22nd looks ALOT like the bullish candle formed on Thursday, May 27th for AMC

The spinning top candle that was formed for GME on Monday, Jan 25th looks alot like the spinning top candle formed on Friday, May 28th for AMC

&#x200B;

Taking into consideration the market is closed on memorial day, is this history repeating itself? If it is, that would mean the squeeze will start next week? Now I don't want to attach certain dates, I'm just sharing more information with you all. You be the judge of it.

Amazon has been looking into this idea even before the pandemic, and delayed its plans because of the pandemic. Essentially, Amazon has a bunch of excess stock of computer equipment in its warehouses that they really just want to get rid of (since it costs money to store). Instead of throwing it out they would prefer to sell it - even at a big discount. This is likely stuff like older graphics cards, monitors, computers etc. This solves a key issue with Gamestop's business model: Gamestop's margin's suck. Selling computer equipment that would have just been thrown out anyway means that every dollar sold is a dollar saved.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**2: A number of ex-Amazon executives already work at Gamestop in the C-Suite**

Due to this - the cultures of the companies are likely to become very similar and people at Amazon and Gamestop are likely to have worked together in the past. This makes any type of business combination much easier

&#x200B;

Here's a couple (I'm sure you guys can add more to this list): 

Chief Growth Officer (CGO):  Elliott Wilke 

Chief Operating Officer (COO):  Jenna Owens

Chief Technology Officer (CTO):  Matt Francis

&#x200B;

**3: A clean exit from a short selling debacle**

Many people have floated around theories of naked short selling, imaginary shares, etc. No matter if you believe these are correct or not lets make an assumption here that there is something fishy going on. If there is something fishy going on, there's nothing the SEC would like more than to neatly sweep it under the rug. Lets say this fishy thing makes it so that closing all short positions in GameStop would cause the stock price to skyrocket due to a share shortage and pose a serious threat to the entire financial system. Obviously this isn't a great outcome if the financial system fails

How does Amazon solve this? An all-stock deal. Short sellers go from being short Gamestop to being short Amazon. The number of liquid shares of Amazon is far greater in dollar value than the liquid shares of Gamestop. This means that short sellers would be able to close out of their position without pushing up Amazon's stock price to some ridiculous number

&#x200B;

**4: Amazon has the cash to bankroll and supercharge Gamestop's innovation**

Between developing NFTs and reinventing their business Gamestop has some challenges ahead of it. To execute on their strategies they will need cash to do so. An Amazon + Gamestop merger is more valuable than Gamestop alone and Amazon alone. Furthermore Amazon could benefit from this Gamestop's NFT technology (think digital rights management solution for all of Amazon's content) and expand its market share in collectables and gaming.

&#x200B;

**5: Amazon could use a distraction from news focusing on thwarted worker unionization attempts**

Being able to shift the news narrative from ""Amazon kills unionization attempts"" to ""Amazon saves \~50,000 jobs at struggling retailer Gamestop"" seems like an obvious perk of doing this deal

&#x200B;

**6: Jeff Bezos is looking for a new project. Being the biggest champion of GameStop would cement his legacy**

Now that Jeff Bezos is stepping down as CEO of Amazon, he has time to work on new projects. Gamestop sounds like a fun fixer-upper for a billionaire with some extra time on his hands. Furthermore the rivalry between Elon Musk and Bezos has never been greater; their competing space projects (blue origin and spacex) have gone head to head in recent years. Elon has a key advantage that Bezos doesn't though - a die-hard fanbase. Arguably these fans have really powered SpaceX and Tesla's success - as Elon's celebrity status draws in talent and sells product. Bezos, while popular doesn't quite have the same type of energized fans. Buying Gamestop would also buy him an army of WSB apes and close the gap.

Elon & Jeff have been rivals for years:

Plus, now that he is single he has time to play videogames!

**7: Bootstrapping Amazon's P/E Ratio**

Buying GameStop would make Amazon look cheaper (in terms of P/E ratio). As of 5/28 yahoo finance is showing forward (next 12 months) PE ratios of 54 for Amazon and 37 for Gamestop (price around 220) as of 5/28

Having a P/E ratio of 54 and buying a company with a PE ratio of 37 makes the combined company have a P/E ratio somewhere between the two. Amazon P/E ratio going from 54 to less than 54 makes the stock look like a better deal to investors.",Amazon should consider buying Gamestop due to natural synergies between the two business models.

Disclaimer 

This is my first shot at a DD since joining a year ago. Just as a disclaimer I’m kinda retarded and not an expert at financial advise. I also hold 70 shares so I’m definitely biased. 

What the hell is NNDM? 

Nano Dimension is technology company that specializes in 3D printing computer chips. The are aimed at disrupting the current method of computer chip manufacturing called PCB (Printed Circuit Board). 

Why should you care? 

As technology develops the need for more complex computer chips increases. Normal PCB fabrication is limited in is manufacturing capabilities. Nano Dimensions printers can print in 3D with multiple materials, allowing for better optimization of electronics. This has the ability to disrupt the ~$60 billion dollar PCB market. Also imagine having the capability of 3D printing chips in space without having to be resupplied every time you need electronics equipment. 

Not only does their product have the potential to be revolutionary but they manufacture and supply all the bulk materials for there product. So once a company buys their 3D printers they almost have to buy the consumables from NNDM. 2/3 of their revenue comes from the printer itself while the other 1/3 comes from support/consumables. 

They are buying up smaller nano printing companies and have secured almost all the competitive patents. One article said the next competition is 2-3 years behind NNDM 

What are the downsides? 

NNDM has been underperforming over the last year or so in its transition to mass market vendor. They are also struggling to gain a foothold in the PCB market right now. 

It’s also been a rollercoaster of a stock, I have seen massive gains and subsequent losses all with in a few months of each other. 

Conclusion 

This is not a stock to buy if you’re expecting instant gains with in a week or so. You invest in this company if you like the potential in their technology. I believe the stock right now at $7 a share is a steal because if they can optimize production for mass market I believe their stock could be $30+ in a few years. 

Also the short volume ratio is sitting at 27% which is higher than AMC’s 23%.",Potential of Nano Dimension $NNDM,,

Hey fellow traders. Today, l’ll present to you a very strong bull case on AMC that is not explained by simply putting a rocket emoji (I love this emoji by the way) or because someone else posted a strong YOLO bet on the stock. Here is my analysis based on volume, price action, and a powerful pattern named the flag, high and tight.

&#x200B;

[Weekly chart](https://preview.redd.it/5bruexp383271.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=f679d9584a983071eaf036df2e4c5be14069eaae)

Firstly on the weekly chart, we see a high tight flag that started developing from the low on January 5th at $1.91 (#1) to the high of the pattern which was achieved on January 27th at a staggering price of $20.36 (#2). In 17 trading days, the stock soared 1065.96%. It’s an understatement that this price action caught my attention. The following months saw the stock consolidate in a flag, high and tight on falling volume. Bulkowski studied this pattern extensively and it’s one of his favorites. HTF is characterised by a rise of at least 90% (aim for double) in less than 2 months followed by a consolidation period on ideally falling volume. I think we easily meet these criteria! The performance rank of this pattern in his work is 1 on 23 in a bull market (1 being the best) with an average rise of 69% and throwbacks happening 54% of the time. Price meets target 90% of the time. The measure rule helps us acquire a potential price target for this trade. In his work, Bulkowski tells us to measure the rise and project it 50% past the breakout point. With the measure rule, using the breakout point at $12, we would have a theoretical price target of $63.96 (1065.96/100/2\*12)). Now to the analysis based on volume and price.

On the weekly chart, we have the breakout on #3 with rising and above average volume. This confirms the breakout is not fake, but supported by the professionals. After the minor pullback, we see the momentum exploding and the price action ripping past $20 on very high volume. Like we will see on the daily chart, the last trading day of the week saw some heavy selling which can be seen with the long upper wick on the weekly chart. 

I attribute this to two things. First, the stock rose to overbought levels and a pullback was imminent. Two, the stock hit the ATH of around $35 and many market participants saw this as a good point to take profits.  While it is true the SI rose in this period, I do not believe shorts created this long upper wick. Seems more likely professionals were taking money off the table. This being said, I do not think we are witnessing a trend end since strong momentums like this one cannot be broken in a single day. Like a big cargo ship, it cannot be stopped simply by turning off the engine. More effort will be necessary to break this rocket for sure. On top of that, the most conservative assessment would bring us to $63.96 in less than 30 days (around June 10th) following the breakout and we have a 90% chance of hitting this target according to Bulkowski. If these are not good odds, I don’t know what is. I truly believe this is an opportunity of a lifetime!

&#x200B;

[Daily chart](https://preview.redd.it/wslu122983271.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a1d2f718d41538d8bfad7ffad44ade99c796356)

On the daily chart, we can see the flag, high and tight develop from January 27th on #2 to the breakout at #3 on May 13th. Developing this cause is important according to Wyckoff’s law of cause and effect. The development of a cause will be proportional to the subsequent effect. On May 14th (breakout day (#4)), we see rising and above average volume that confirms the start of a new trend. Then, the test of supply on the pullback at #5, we see falling volume until the stock reaches $12 which means there is no interest in selling at these prices. The rally resumes on very nice long white candles on steadily rising volume which means volume and price are in harmony fully supported by the great professionals. 

On the second to last candle, we see some selling happening as shown with the upper wick. On #6, we see a tall black candle that closes very close to the prior day’s close. I associate this candle with the bearish meeting lines candle. Bulkowski’s work establishes the candle to be a continuation pattern 51% of the time in a bull market, which is pretty much as valid as a coin toss. If the next day’s close is below this candle, Bulkowski tells us there is a 70% chance the candle acts as a reversal. So this is to be looked at closely for next week. The long upper wick and shorter lower wick associated with very high volume tells me there was more selling happening Friday by the professionals. 

We must remember that stocks do not trend in a straight line. Volatility is cyclical, and all this is normal price action. Even in the event that Friday’s price action is stopping volume by the great professionals and the beginning of a distribution phase, Wyckoff’s work tells us this is associated with a potential preliminary supply and this stopping action ALWAYS fails and thus the rally WILL continue. Ladies and gents, I cannot stress enough how AMC is trading currently at a discount and any entry point is a good one at this point in time. We do not choose our seats on a rocket ship! You get in, strap on, and enjoy the ride! Trying to perfectly time the bottom on any pullback is a fool’s errand! Looking back at the daily chart on AMC, #1 (hanging man) and #3 (dark cloud cover) shows us that any bearish candle in the recent history of this stock is likely to be very short lived. Shorting this stock based on the bearish meeting lines (weak bearish candle by the way) would be a very dangerous endeavour indeed.

[30 minutes chart](https://preview.redd.it/erdc846b83271.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ec91557abfecf685c4af681eaf68f0da6a1fd9b)

Lastly, on the 30 minutes chart, friday we see at #1 strong buying pressure as seen with the long lower wick and high volume at $25.50. #2 was a retest on falling volume meaning falling interest to sell at this price. I do believe we have strong support at this level.

No one has a crystal ball and this could go either way, but the odds are that we reach $63.96 by the end of June with a 90% probability according to Bulkowski. I am adding to my position at any dip in this stock. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qbs706tc83271.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=8669186d98ef0792b216b50992969cd1d08fe785

If history is of any guide, I expect AMC to have a short consolidation period with falling volume like we saw with GME before the great run up. Thus, I believe we have another week to add to our positions before this really takes off. Any close above 35$ will be extremely bullish

I’ve been reading many posts explaining the short squeeze potential and this adds to the excitement of a strong bull run in this stock way past $63.96. AMC is currently the most shorted stock in the market as we speak. Though I have doubts that AMC will reach 500k like many claim, I do believe we have a strong squeeze potential in this stock as shown by the candles and volume recently printed on the charts. Ultimately, volume and price will tell us when it is time to close our positions.

Cheers,

Edit: Just to be clear, Bulkowski’s HTF gives us a 90% chance to hit the target in the next 30 days after the breakout. This target is his CONSERVATIVE target not MY target. I do NOT plan to sell at this target. I have no price target at this time since it could squeeze to 10k for all I know.

90,2021-05-29 17:51:54,t3_nnsnmx,nnsnmx,wallstreetbets,"TL;DR: Trucking will be the first viable business for autonomous vehicles. TuSimple ($TSP) currently has the best autonomous truck tech and is the closest to commercialization. 

&#x200B;

Why not Robotaxis?

Robotaxis are sexier and thus get all the media attention. But commercialization of robotaxis currently poses several technical, operational, and business challenges. 

&#x200B;

Why not Robotaxis: Technical

Robotaxis are most profitable in downtown environments. But those environments also pose the greatest challenges for an autonomous vehicle due to the large number of hard-to-predict agents. No company has been able to solve those yet. 

&#x200B;

Pick up and drop offs are also technically very challenging because, frankly, most Uber/Lyft pick up and drop offs in downtown environments are in illegal locations. Human drivers can get away with that. But a computer system cannot be programmed to perform illegal actions without the company being held responsible.

&#x200B;

Why not Robotaxis: Operational

With Uber or Lyft, the drivers do much more than just drive. They purchase, store, clean, fuel/charge, and maintain their vehicles. With robotaxis, all of this operational load falls to the robotaxi company. Where are they going to store thousands of vehicles in downtown environments? How are they going to charge them and perform all of the other operational tasks? Even if this problem could be solved, it means that robotaxis will scale much more slowly than Uber or Lyft did.

&#x200B;

Why not Robotaxis: Business

The cost of robotaxis is currently extremely high due to the compute and sensor requirements. Even if they perform perfectly, it will take a long time before they are more profitable than vehicles with human drivers.

&#x200B;

Further, recent regulation in the US has shown that the public support is behind the drivers, not the silicon valley companies. Driving for Uber and Lyft has been a lifeline to people who lost their jobs during the pandemic. So robotaxis are going to be viewed with hostility and likely backlash from the public and thus from governments. 

&#x200B;

Why Trucking?

Why Trucking: Technical

Highway driving, though higher speed, is much more structured than downtown environments. In most ways it is much easier, as evidenced by current level 2 driver assistance systems that easily handle most highway driving. It does, however, require much longer range perception. We will return to that below.

&#x200B;

Why Trucking: Operational

Trucks already have all of the operational infrastructure. They are stored at depots. They have dedicated staff for their cleaning, maintenance, fueling, etc. Making trucks autonomous can simply leverage all of this infrastructure.

&#x200B;

Why Trucking: Business

There is currently a shortage of truck drivers. Freight shippers want to ship faster (and not need to wait for drivers to sleep). Truck driving is not a fun or healthy job. It keeps people away from their families. And trucking is a $4T industry globally ($1T in the US). 

&#x200B;

Given the long lifespan of trucks and their ability to run for millions of miles, the cost of the autonomous compute and sensor system can be amortized much better than for robotaxis.

&#x200B;

In short, the stars are all aligned for autonomous trucks today.

&#x200B;

Why TuSimple? 

The players who started with robotaxis have built their entire tech stack around detailed but short range perception. Trying to convert that tech stack to trucking poses more challenges than one might expect. But since TuSimple has focused on trucking from the beginning (2015), they have built their stack to have 1000 meter perception - more than 4x other companies.

&#x200B;

TuSimple also has been building up partnerships with the rest of the international freight ecosystem since the beginning. They have key partnerships with OEMs, Tier 1s, shipping companies, and part manufacturers in the US, Europe, and Asia. None of the other autonomous companies have that.

&#x200B;

TuSimple is also building their Autonomous Freight Network across the US in multiple phases. Initially, only corridors with favorable weather will be autonomous. But as the technology improves to be able to handle heavy rain and snow, additional corridors can be easily flipped from manual to autonomous mode. 

&#x200B;

But, but, aren’t they Chinese?

They definitely have ties to China. Their first investors were Chinese. So what? 

&#x200B;

This actually gives them an advantage vs pure US players: they have easy access to the entire trucking market in China.

&#x200B;

Conclusion

Given all of the above, TuSimple is undervalued with its current valuation of about $8B. Some other self-driving companies are around $30B or more, despite facing all of the challenges mentioned. 

&#x200B;

In other words: TSP to the moon, apes!

TLDR: SILVER and GOLD MOON by end of june and spy might drill.

&#x200B;

A lot of basel 3 regulations are happening on june 28 2021 and an important one is the Net Stable Funding Rate. 

This regulation in essence requires banks to prove their physical holdings of commodities relative to the amount of physical commodities they have lent out or shorted or leveraged on.

[https://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs271.pdf](https://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs271.pdf)

more details on that link\^

&#x200B;

Many commodities traders say this is the single biggest event in their career and this regulation could send SILVER and GOLD to the moon when:

1. Banks reveal they don't have enough physical holdings -> indicates shortage 
2. Banks can't short physical commodities like gold and silver beyond their physical holdings -> banks cover their shorts causing a squeeze. Banks manipulating the silver market is not a conspiracy theory spread during the gme squeeze to distract wsb retards from gme. The manipulation has been going on for a long time and big banks have been fined heavily for manipulating the silver market ([https://www.reuters.com/article/jp-morgan-spoofing-penalty-idUSKBN26K325](https://www.reuters.com/article/jp-morgan-spoofing-penalty-idUSKBN26K325))

JP Morgan has been a big culprit of manipulating the precious metals market by suppressing the price through paper shorts and when the price falls they buy physical bars of silver.

&#x200B;

Recall that the basel three regulations take place on june 28. Take a look at the OI for $SPY

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[OI for $SPY](https://preview.redd.it/yxbdwumzr3271.jpg?width=652&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ef7a95c937dfdcf0cc136a95c09205a46ddb6c64)

Look at the 06/30 oi. There's an unusually high oi for 06/30 which is a weekly expiry whereas all the other weeklys are nowhere close to the oi on 06/30. There's a 74% oi for put and 25% oi for call on that expiry and similar ratios for the expiries close to june 28 when the basel 3 regulations take effect.

&#x200B;

Now look at the oi for $SLV

&#x200B;

[OI for $SLV](https://preview.redd.it/on521lejs3271.png?width=1232&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fb65ae75d160e8df27682d7a24ddeb82a946d36)

Again look at the 06/30 expiry with the unusally high oi. 1.1 million oi on 06/30 which is INSANELY HIGH for any expiry let alone a weekly. And at this expiry the call oi is 80% and the put oi is 19% which is the opposite of what was observed with SPY. 

Now, normal wsb retards have no idea of basel 3 and the effects on the precious metals market. The high oi and call oi on june 30 on $SLV can't be attributed to wsb retards who hate silver. It's most likely the smart money coming into play. 

Spy has a high put/call ratio while silver has a high call/put ratio on that expiry. Similar values on QQQ and GLD respectively. This points to a scenario where silver moons and spy drills.

Take note that june 28 has a lot of other regulations coming into place as well and there can be other huge moves in the market in other sectors due to the different regulations.

A lot of wsb thought the silver squeeze movement was a conspiracy by the banks but look up the data by yourself if you aren't convinced by this dd.",BASEL 3 is going to send SILVER and GOLD to the MOON,,

Array, $ARRY is a solar systems company that was founded in 1989 and IPO’d on October 15, 2020 and currently has a market cap of 2B. Array makes money by selling mounting/tracking systems for big solar production plants that increase efficiency by tracking the sun allowing the panels to absorb more energy. This video from Array shows their systems well: 

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nhDWaT5MjVA

   GROWTH:

Yearly:

Revenue:
2018: $290M
2019: $648M (+123% YoY) 
2020: $873M (+35% YoY)

Net income:
2018: -$61M
2019: $40M
2020: $59M (+48% YoY)

Quarterly:

Revenue:
Q3 2020: $139M
Q4 2020: $180M (+29% QoQ)
Q1 2021: $245M (+36% QoQ)

Net Income:
Q3 2020: -$7M
Q4 2020: -$2M
Q1 2021: 3M


Good growth numbers on everything except the latest QoQ net income (will get to later). 

Now on to the growth of solar as a sector, specifically on utility production (not residential/personal) because Array’s consumers are only in the utility sector. Array has 12% market share of the solar tracking systems. The growth of the solar utility sector directly influences the growth of Array. Solar been quickly rising over the last decade as cost of solar technology decreased significantly over that time period. Solar energy is now cheaper to produce than coal, natural gas and nuclear as of 2020. Energy production and utility companies will follow the money and continue to build solar plants to capitalize on this opportunity. 

US Solar Production from Utility (GWh)
2011: 1,800
2012: 4,300 (+138%)
2013: 9,200 (+114%)
2014: 18,300 (+99%)
2015: 26,500 (+45%)
2016: 36,700 (+38%)
2017: 53,000 (+44%)
2018: 66,600 (+26%)
2019: 72,200 (+9%)
2020: 90,900 (+26%)
Source: United States Department of Energy 

Solar accounted for 2.3% of total energy production in 2020. Obviously plenty of room to grow. Coal, Natural gas and Nuclear combined for 80% of total US electricity production in 2020. Now that solar is the cheapest energy source I expect it to take a large portion of that pie, maybe 25% or more in the next 10-15 years would be my guess. The only thing holding solar back is that the power grids in the US are build only to directly transport electricity from the source to its destination. So there is no element of the grid designed to store electricity. This has not been an issue in the past bc coal, nuclear, natural gas and even hydro produce energy 24/7. Obviously Solar can only produce in the day. The solution to this issue is large, utility scale electric storage. The exact kind provided by Tesla. These storage systems will provide necessary liquidity and versatility to the grid with solar production. The Lithium Ion batteries in these storage systems are rapidly decreasing in price. Prices of Li-Ion batteries have dropped 90% in the last decade. As it becomes more appealing for Tesla and other  companies to construct these storage systems and start providing more utility scale electricity storage, more utility companies will invest in solar rigs. It will be more profitable to produce and won’t be held back by the limitations of old grid infrastructure. 

Good video by CNBC on the Grid, Storage systems, and the growth of solar utility production:

   UNDERVALUED:

In the first few months after IPO Array’s price held around the low $40’s, hitting a high of $53.99. In late January until now the stock has sold off significantly. There are 3 main reasons for this and why the concerns are irrelevant in the long term.

1. Broader market tech/growth sell off due to inflation FUD. I’m not going to try to predict if inflation will stay, shoot up, or go back down to relatively normal levels but there is one think I know for sure. Tech/growth is cheaper now. Barring hyperinflation and or a depression, this dip gives long term investors a good buying opportunity. 
2. Tax credit changes hurt YoY revenue. ITC is a federal tax credit that allows people or businesses to right off x% of the cost they spent on solar (and directly related related systems/expenses) on their income tax. This % was 30% up to the end of 2019. Then it is lowered to 26% from 2020-2022, then to 22% in 2023, then 2024+ to 0% for residential and 10% for commercial utility and scale. The fact that there is still a 10% tax creditor the foreseeable future is great. And it doesn’t matter that residential dropped to 0% because Array doesn’t operate in that market. So why would this Tax Credit be bad? Well going back to the top of the post under Quarterly net income I said I would get to later. Q1 2020 was a great Q for array and their revenue. Revenue or that quarter was $438M, compared to the total yearly revenue in 2019 of $650M. Sense that great quarter. Revenue has dropped significantly. And now because YoY of the last Q report is compared to that breakout Q, it makes this Q and YoY growth look really bad. I believe that Q1 2020 revenue was drastically and temporary inflated because of an element of the ITC tax credit. There is a way that constructing solar systems can grab on and hold on to the higher 30% credit from 2019 even if they don’t finish construction before 2020. It is called safe haven. Basically if construction is started and there is a continuous effort made to complete construction and as long as that construction is finished within 4 years, the business will receive the 30% tax credit. In this quarters earnings report, when referring to the 44% decrease in YoY revenue, Array’s CEO said “Results were lower to last year because of the unseasonably high high volume of shipments we had in the first Q 2020 to consumers that were safe harboring tracker systems in connection with the ITC step down” So it seems clear that Array was flooded with orders late 2019 to take advantage of the safe harbor and those revenues showed up on Q1 2020 financials. So even though the YoY revenue from last earnings was bad I believe that the order flow Array is getting was inflated in Q1 2020 and is now deflated because of all the businesses that would be buying trackers now, but bought them earlier because they wanted the better tax credits. I can see this cycle of inflated and deflated order flow/revenue relative to the decreases in ITC tax credits continue until 2024 when the credit stabilizes at 10%. I believe bad YoY data is just a distraction from great long term growth and creates a great buying opportunity.  
3. Supply chain FUD and one time stock based compensation hurt profits. Rapid increase in the price of raw materials, goods and even cost of transporting those goods going up. Supply chain FUD has stacked on top of inflation FUD sense late February until last earnings and has caused a substantial sell off in Array stock. This Supply chain FUD was realized in last quarters earnings (Q1 2021) when profitably/margins sank because cost of goods shot through the roof. “This industry (solar tracking) is contending with increase in steel and shipping costs that are unprecedented in both magnitude and the rate of change.” - Jim Fusaro, Array CEO in Q1 2021 report. YoY the cost of steel has more than doubled Steel represents the almost half of Array’s cost of goods sold so it’s extreme increase in price has an large impact on the bottom line. Shipping costs have also shot up significantly and have the same effect on the bottom line. Even though revenue in Q1 2020 was $438M and revenue Q1 2021 was $246M, operating costs were higher in this Q large due to one time expense that come with becoming a public company. This includes increase in equity based compensation and costs related to common stock. This is simply a short term expense that negatively impacted this Q earnings and will have no further impact on profits/margins. Array is taking action to secure long term contracts with freight providers and fixing commodity prices with suppliers. This action from array combined with the fact that ridiculous prices of shipping and materials will drop in the next year or two as supply meets demand thanks to capitalism. This Supply chain FUD and bad profitability/margin data from last quarter I believe will also have no impact on future growth long term and only creates a good buying opportunity.

Then up till Friday next week I think it’ll be relatively calm as well moving no more than 10% up or down. Then the following week starting that Monday and whenever AMC does whatever they’re doing with their stock based on the vote from June 2nd, it’ll be huge Green Day’s from there on out with few days in between where it doesn’t go up more than 20% consecutively.

June 2nd could go either way red or green but I think will trade relatively sideways and end down 1-5% from the day before because people will want to see where we end that day. Then up till Friday next week I think it’ll be relatively calm as well moving no more than 10% up or down. Then the following week starting that Monday and whenever AMC does whatever they’re doing with their stock based on the vote from June 2nd, it’ll be huge Green Day’s from there on out with few days in between where it doesn’t go up more than 20% consecutively.

Rivian is talking about IPO'ing at a $50 billion valuation, meanwhile LTM has a $1.5 billion market cap, someone enlighten me?

Everything looked to have gone off successfully. We are now waiting on the data and craft to be analysed and inspected. This will take a few weeks according to Michael Colglazier.
That being said he had already outlined the test schedule in the earnings zoom call.

1st test flight - may 
2nd crewed flight - June 
3rd flight with R Branson on board late June/July 

4th flight this will be taking the Italian airforce on a training mission (600k a seat) late July


On the run in to the first test flight some possible maintenance issues appeared with the carrier plane White knight 2…. 
This indeed could have gone either way , after 2 weeks inspections it was decided that WK2 did not need to delay testing no maintenance was needed at this point. Scheduled Maintenance will commence in the fall after all tests have been completed.
Upon this news it is my opinion that the testing programme will go ahead as planned.

The market has responded accordingly and the stock is now up from $17-€31

With all these catalysts lined up before the end of the year and commercial operations looming for early 2022 things are looking up for Virgin Galactic.The success of the last test flight the company have now proven tech and concept. 
Also with revenue now coming in Nasa who are conducting micro gravity analysis.
Also international training for military pilots and astronauts.

The plan includes creating an online ticketing platform by Great British Railways which might have a huge blow on Trainline revenue. However, this platform does not yet exist and will probably take a couple of years to develop. Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed.

In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales.  Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%.

I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time  for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

 -🚀Mexico/US P3 trials and Price outlook 🚀-
Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days probable, end of June worst case) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July-August for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent or close to Moderna.  Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects)  Chart on Contracts nvax has and what future prices/MC is expected to be is down below in the ""DD literature section"" at the bottom



-🚀 Intro to Protein and mRNA type Vaccines🚀 -
Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

             
                           
-🚀Differences how Protein vs.mRNA vaxs work🚀 -
Imagine if the spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize one piece to understand the whole picture it and helps modify your Messenger RNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates it can still recognize the virus. In the mRNA method using one portion of the picture as virus mutates,  it becomes easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine. , that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. .... And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein.



-🚀 Safety, Side Effects, and Adjuvenants  🚀-
 Every vaccine uses what's called an adjuvenant. This basically boosts the vaccines effectiveness. There's different kinds, and every company uses one in their vaccine. Not all are created equal. What makes Nvaxs adjuvenant (called Matrix M) so special its the only plant based (soapbark tree) adjuvenants out there, and is the least irritating. This adjuvenant has been tested on pregnant women in the past and past the flying colors. mRNA adjuvenant vaccines use common molecules found in viruses and bacteria that stimulate our immune system. This approach has not been fully tested on pregnant women long term. One of the most common types that were used in the past were aluminum salts. They were found not to be ""harmful"" but we also didn't know enough about them and how they affect us on a grander scale. A lot of anti-vaxxers are against aluminum salts and giving it to the children. This is why Nvax will be the perfect solution for anti-vaxxers, children and the eldery that want something completely safe. Just using the term plant-based in a vaccine heads a good connotation let alone the stronger protection/immune responce it provides. As far as what the virus is being grown in and Nvax uses a moth based formula. So it's insect and plant-based. Sounds like the Karen's will love this! Ultra safe. 


Adjuvenants work by creating an irritation/inflammation at the injection site, This in turn helps the vaccines be more effective apon administration. This is what makes you feel sore after getting a vaccine and specifically amount of adjuvenate that being used.  NVAX only needs to use 5mM vs  mRNA type vaccines use anywhere from 50 to 100 mM of adjuvenant. Therefore when getting a vaccine from mRNA type vaccines you get a much stronger side effect due to the amount being used. Also this is proof how effective novax is because they need to use so little to be effective hence why they have the best data and we're called a first in class vaccine. In conjunction with how much adjuvenant is being used you can say it basically directly alters the safety profile. Use too much you get too many bad reactions. This is why Nvax has one of the best safety profiles out there. Bottom of my post is a link with a lot of data and that data is included all the side effects of each vaccine charted out to show this.


 Lastly because the amount of ajuvenant used in mRNA type vaccines it can only fit one maybe two strains max before throwing off the safety profile and risking not getting approval.  If they do use two strains they have to use less of both to combine them meaning you're not going to get complete protection for each strain that's in the vaccine.  Nvax does not have this problem because of the such small amount they use, they could combine up to five different strains without an issue.... And right now with it being so clear that covid strains are going to keep mutating we need vaccines thay can cover multiple strains and give full protection on each one. Sometimes one strain can cover multiple strains but depending on where the mutation is if it's a bad mutation you need to address each strain individually and putting them together in one vaccine. Since you can't get four strains in one mRNA vaccine this puts us out at a clear advantage down the road when people need to do booster shots and don't want to get multiple vaccines through the year and don.  So all in all it's clear Nvax adjuvenant separates it from the pack and performs much better then other kinds on Safety, Effectiveness, Coverage of all strains  and convenience of getting less covid vaccines through the year. 


-🚀 Logistics and Storage.🚀 -
Nvax can be stored it in a regular refrigerator, and let it sit out in room temperature for a while while you're vaccinating people instead of a special ultra low temp freeze needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers, this is a majority of the world, not to mention the intricate ways you got to handle it so increases your distribution cost because you need special warehouses, dry ice etc. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

                 
- 🚀 Scientific conclusion 🚀  -
So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines so other protein competitors will be far behind and they will have an a moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing they teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine. They will be combining flu and covid vaccine by 2025 for possibly double the price of current covid vaccine.



 -🚀 Investment Thesis & Financials  🚀-
They are pretty much de-risked at this point vs where they were a year ago. Yes you could buy other  biotechs that can go up 20x but are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up) that has all successful trials done so far, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment to where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place there are no more glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""


They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. Yesterday at market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. 
 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 


Future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract in there ( in the link below in another message). It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 



 -🚀My Positions and Future Price of Nvax🚀 -
As far as my position I own some $200 July calls along with about 933 shares. I'm all in baby.  Been in since $4.06, I panicked and sold once during February a couple months during the mini bear market we had and got back in a bit too early so got a wash sale 🙈 but I'm diamond hands all the way to $800 from here.  LFG  (Check out next link below this paragraph, it has My positions and an amazing DD chart converting contracts to future price and comparing with competitors. My screen name on stovktwits  is the same on there Johnnyknowsbest. Been on there and here since i started with nvax.


Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. This is huge as the combo is going to differentiate them especially since both flu and covid vaccines are first in class

# SPY SG:

Looks like low volatility day. Play tight.

Note from SG: ""For todays expiration our models show about 15% SPX /30% SPY gamma expiring, which could allow volatility increase a bit into next week. This in turn may free markets for a push up into that 4250 target (Call Wall) area.""

Gamma Index: decreased to -0.1 (A large negative figure indicates volatility may be high. The range is from 4 to –4.)

Vol Trigger: Increased to 419 (Important support and resistance level. (above this level = lower volatility and a more stable stock price.)

Abs Gamma Strike: Unchanged

Gamma Notional: Decreased to $-516 (stock has larger put gamma position. A negative gamma position implies higher volatility in the underlying)

Put Wall Support: Increased to 419 (If Put Wall shifts to a higher strike it could be a bearish indication)

Call Wall Strike: Increased to 425 (When this strike is rolled higher it is generally considered bullish)

Gamma Tilt: Decreased to 0.88	 (when decreasing it’s a bearish signal.)

Net Delta: Increased to 198k (positive delta position infers options market makers have a net long hedge.)

25d risk reversal: Increased to -0.06 (When the ratio shifts towards 0 it indicates call demand)

1) We look to the PTON CFO's statement found in the latest earnings call transcript, for guidance:
""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior.""
2) Being that we do not have access to a 10-K filing for Q4 fiscal '19, we will access other filings that do in fact reference numbers from fiscal '19...
A) 10-K filing dated 9/11/2020
B) 10-Q filing dated 5/6/2020
3) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $223.3M under Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19)
But, that is TOTAL Revenue; we need to find out what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike sales...
4) To calculate what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike Sales, we can use numbers from neighboring Q3 (i.e. Three Months Ended March 31, 2019)...
A) On page 6 of the 10-Q, you will find Revenue of ""Connected Fitness Products"" (aka Bike Sales) to be $261.6M
B) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $316.7M
C) % of Bike Sales per TOTAL Revenue: $261.6M / $316.7M * 100 = 82.6% {""Connected Fitness Products"" Revenue (aka Bike Sales)}
5) Apply 82.6% to the TOTAL Revenue $223.3M for Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19): $223.3M x 0.826 = $184.45M {Bike Sales for Q4 of fiscal '19}
6) Per the CFO, ""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior."":

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote... By mid-July, we’ll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase precious metals  especially silver amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative 

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

Gold rose over 60% in the 1930s as the prices of stocks and real estate crashed. You could buy an entire block with a one ounce gold coin. Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms.

I must address Cramer's statement because he is obviously trying to add fuel to the short-selling fire: When he says ""we're not going natural gas"" he is clearly making a vague and general statement meant to be interpreted in the worst possible way: ""no one is going to buy or use natural gas."" By now, I hope everyone that is interested in this stock understands that CLNE offers an alternative transportation fuel, thus, the investments made by BP and Chevron, and not revolutionary technology like some EV's (but this is mostly hype meant to catapult EVs to the front. What most people do not realize is that driverless technology and such can be placed in Petro vehicles too). Also, unfortunately, the company has done a terrible marketting job. That's why powerful analysts can get away with making vague and unsupported statements. The fact that Cramer explained the stock's decrease over the last month as being due to widespread dissaproval is misleading, at best. Many people do not yet know about the cleanliness and therapeutic effects RNG has on the climate. We must get the word out and pressure CLNE corporate to begin marketting campaigns to get the word out. I think it's about time.",Cramer on CLNE,,

I want to cover two tickers here, $SNDL which currently meets the sidebar rules with today's move. 1.6B market cap and is trading above $1. I get it mods, you gonna mod but I'll keep writing. The other is the infamous $TLRY.   


The News...

If you haven't read yet it looks like Federal Cannabis legalization my be around the corner. [Here](https://www.mpp.org/policy/federal/the-more-act/) is the House Bill. Supporters seem on board and like the reforms they have done to the bill including rescheduling cannabis. [Last time](https://mjbizdaily.com/key-us-house-lawmaker-reintroduces-federal-marijuana-legalization-bill/) the bill was introduced it cleared the House.   


Personally I think this gets a lot of support especially from a fiscal point of view. With stimulus stalling and a giant debate going on about how to pay for the stimulus I think cannabis offers the easiest way to collect federal revenue. A simple review of the bill and the fiscal benefits to the Fed's can be read [here](https://www.justtherealnews.com/congress/nadler-blumenauer-lee-jackson-lee-jeffries-velazquez-reintroduce-comprehensive-marijuana-reform-legislation/). The bill states a 5% fed tax. Money coming for uncle Sam, right when questions about paying for stimulus.... Personally I think it adds up, but that's for you to decide. 

Okay so that's the hype...

Let's talk about the tickers listed ($SNDL and $TLRY). 

$SNDL

I'll start with the cheaper YOLO, $SNDL. $SNDL short interest isn't high, but the company did issue convertible notes a while back around .7c if my memory is correct. I'm not saying they won't do it again, but they should be in a good place fiscally for now. Float is high with about 1.6B shares out there. However today's volume at the time of writing is over 415M. That's not bad given such a high float. It's about 200% more than the average volume. 

The options chain on $SNDL has me giddy. With over 200,000 options currently in the money on todays move above $1 there is some high potential here for some interesting action. The put to call ratio is just obnoxiously low at .08 it's screaming upwards betting. If we hold above $1 the potential squeeze up could be amazing.   


It's also broken up on the trend lines and out of the downward channel it was in. The regression channel from the peak squeeze back in Feb just broke out today according to my crayons I have laying around. 

$TLRY

$TLRY was the squeeze of a lifetime if you remember it back in 19'. The ticker was just a money printer with it's low float and stupid hype. Then they proceeded to do, like they all do, and issue debt. Shares tumbled since then falling from $120 --> $5. Ouch bag holders.   


Like all the cannabis stocks the Feb bump pushed $TLRY to above $60 in an amazing move. $TLRY has a lower short interest than $SNDL, but it also has a much lower float at about 300M. Compared to $SNDL the volume here isn't as good, but still remains decently above the avg volume around 36M as of right now. 

If we peep the options chain we also see a crazy low P/C ratio around .11. But we don't have the Open Interest in the chain like $SNDL does unless you roll out to Jun 18. Then we finally get some decent OI.   


Personally I am going with $SNDL. The option's chain looks better, the stock is cheaper, and the short interest is a little better. My advice would be to roll out till at least the Jun 11th $1 strike to not get eaten alive by Theta and IV crush. But WSB does what WSB wants and that's why I love you all.   
Do not go above the $2 strikes IMO. You will get crushed by theta unless we get an insane move, which could happen but I don't see the risk / reward there.",MORE ACT / CANNABIS / $SNDL & $TLRY Potential,,

>A corner in the silver market has been tried before - and let's be clear, that is what is being attempted now.  In 1980, a rule change by the government destroyed the corner.  #silverthursday.

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday

>Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers’ attempt to corner the market on the metal.

-
>Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926–2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt’s 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers’ Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.

-
>By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged—March 27—silver fell to $10.80, the metal’s biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, “A billion dollars isn’t what it used to be,” the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.

-
>To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978–91) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities.",There is no silver short squeeze happening.

* Geeta Gupta-Fisker is a solid Chief Financial Officer with experience in investment banking - she will ensure the shares are valued right
* Henrik has learned from all the mistakes he made with his previous attempt to create Fisker Automotive, and will certainly do everything in his power to avoid that mess again. He has designed systems into the intricacies of the company to avoid failure - meaning Fisker Inc is guaranteed to succeed
* Henrik Fisker on shorting $FSR - “You will quickly understand that you stand to lose a lot of money if you show it against Fisker”
* Production of Fisker Ocean expected to start in November 2022
* 250,000+ units a year expected by 2025
* Partnerships with Foxconn and Magna Steyr, both giants in their respective industries, among others

In 2007, Tesla Motors hired Henrik Fisker to perform initial design work on the Tesla Model S electric sedan, which was introduced in 2012.

Fisker stated in 2018 that, with the growth of car-sharing, ride-hailing, and autonomous shuttles, he believes within 10 years private cars will be used for less than half of what they are currently used for.

## Fisker Automotive

In 2008, Fisker Automotive raised over $90 million from investors including venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. In September 2009, Fisker Automotive was awarded a $528 million loan guarantee by the United States Department of Energy (DOE). The automaker was one of four recipients of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, to encourage the domestic manufacture of electric cars. The funds were to be used to develop the Karma, as well as an affordable family-size plug-in hybrid car. The loan facility was frozen at $192 million in February 2012, after the DOE claimed that Fisker missed its milestones

In December 2011, just as the Fisker Karma was launched, its battery supplier, A123 Systems, recalled all batteries, followed by a second recall in 2012. A123 filed for bankruptcy in October 2012, leaving Fisker Automotive without a battery supplier. After selling approximately 2,000 units, production of the Fisker Karma was suspended in November 2012, in the absence of its battery supplier.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/59vfj5wa8w171.png?width=511&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1c03d1e1254fea00c195776122de2b26099dd35

Henrik Fisker resigned as chairman from Fisker Automotive in March 2013, because of disagreements with management about business strategy. Later that year, the company declared voluntary bankruptcy.Fisker raised and spent more than a billion dollars over its lifetime.The heart of Fisker’s business model was in that early deal with Quantum. The idea was to design a gorgeous car, and have suppliers like Quantum provide the technology because off-the-shelf parts from suppliers would help keep costs down.

But there were problems with this strategy: Sometimes, those parts had to be custom-made to fit the design vision, which resulted in higher prices for Fisker. Other times, parts were delivered late or, worse, faulty, but Fisker was locked in to those supplier relationships. Sources close to Fisker have also said that many of the parts were owned by the suppliers themselves, so Fisker didn’t own a lot of the internal technology.

The broker that raised funds for Fisker automotive, by selling their private shares, was Advanced Equities.It wasn’t until December 2011 and into 2012 that the more dubious efforts of Advanced Equities became clearer to Fisker’s hundreds of investors. The last few hundred million dollars of Advanced Equities’ fund raising for Fisker, starting with the D-1 round, was what brokers call “pay to play.” As Fisker was running into technical, delivery and political problems, its valuation was quickly declining. But the company still needed more money, so the brokers went back to its current investors and said: Unless you give this more, your current shares will be diluted and your preferred stock will be converted to common stock.

It was essentially a gun to their heads. This is why investor Wray sued Fisker in February 2012, alleging he was on the receiving end of this tactic. In his lawsuit, he says Advanced Equities sent him a letter dated Jan. 18, 2012, stating that he needed to decide if he wanted to invest in Fisker’s next round, and pay around $84,000 by Jan. 27, 2012 — a little over a week from receiving the letter. He also says that Advanced Equities assured him that he would have anti-dilution protection. According to the audio clip from Advanced Equities’ internal sales call in early 2010, Advanced Equity leaders say that the Fisker deal will “suffer no dilution,” and was “a dream scenario.”

That dream would soon end. In September 2012 after Fisker closed on $1.2 billion in funding, the bulk of it organized by Advanced Equities, the SEC charged the broker with misleading investors when it raised money for another company back in 2009 and 2010 (Bloom Energy). Advanced settled, agreeing to pay $1 million, and its co-founders were personally fined. Two months later Advanced Equities closed up shop.

Later, A123 Systems itself went bankrupt, causing more problems for Fisker. Fisker claimed that A123 Systems owed it $140 million, but a bankruptcy settlement reduced that to a paltry $15 million.

Then there was the just plain terrible luck for the ironically named Karma: Super Storm Sandy wiped out 338 of its Karmas in storage in New Jersey. The cars first drowned, and then caught on fire — salt water damage caused a short circuit that was spread to other cars by high winds, Fisker said at the time.

With all of this happening in public — and in a presidential election year — Fisker’s struggles became highly politicized. The company was mentioned numerous times in presidential debates and speeches leading up to the election. Republican nominee Romney called Fisker and other DOE-supported companies losers.

The company didn’t seem to invest substantially in technology innovation or tech IP, and seemed to spend a disproportionate amount on suppliers. For example, numerous sources have said that the company paid upfront for 15,000 of some of the parts for its planned 15,000 Karmas. It ended up only selling around 2,000 of the cars. It has also been said that Fisker paid some funds upfront to have BMW make engines for the 100,000 Nina cars it hoped to produce — in the end, Fisker didn’t deliver a single Nina.

Costs to build each Karma also creeped up because the company missed its volume targets, and because engineering had to change designs around supplier constraints. The company ended up adding $20,000 to its initial sale price.

Expensive hires may also have sucked away chunks of Fisker’s funding: Sources say that Fisker filled the upper levels of the company with seasoned auto executives from Detroit. At the high point of Fisker, the company had around 300 employees, plus dozens of contract staff. Bringing in a certain amount of the old guard could help a car startup ramp up quickly, and also impress potential investors with “industry names.” But those people are also used to big auto-industry budgets that included extensive travel and salaries — that’s the opposite life of a tech startup.

## Fisker Inc.

In July 2016, Henrik Fisker expressed interest in designing a fully connected electric car with autonomous driving features and an aesthetically pleasing look. He has pursued battery technology, and hinted at potentially reviving the Fisker name with a pure-electric vehicle using technology that nobody else has. Since then Fisker has talked about delays to the promised solid state battery technology, which he does not expect to be able to be produced in volume until at least 2025. Posing risk for competition from more scientifically experienced future solid state battery producers such as Quantumscape.

***Forbes:*** “Now he’s back–and three things are different. First and foremost, he has a vital new partner: his wife, cofounder and Fisker Inc. CFO Geeta Gupta-Fisker. Second, his Los Angeles-based company is public this time around, raising more than $1 billion in an October 2020 IPO. And finally, Fisker’s stock price, up 56% since its debut, has made both Henrik and Geeta billionaires, each worth about $1.1 billion as of Friday’s market close. The auto industry has seen father-son and sibling leadership teams, but Fisker Inc.’s CEO-CFO combo is the fast-changing sector’s first husband and wife power couple.”

Wealth isn’t the purpose of the new company, Henrik says. “I never got into cars because of money. (This shows he is willing to do what is in the best interest of the company because he is not motivated by money, unlike 99% of other CEO’s)

The couple sought a big stake in the new venture to ensure they can control its fate in a way Fisker couldn’t with his earlier company.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yzhded6pfw171.png?width=408&format=png&auto=webp&s=54b30259720cf853a8efeacf058f2f74315260b9

Henrik is an auto industry celebrity, but Geeta’s background is equally impressive. A native of India, she holds multiple degrees in science, including a Ph.D. in biotechnology from Cambridge University where she was also a Research Newton Fellow. From there, she started a career in international investment for Lloyds Banking Group, and then managed investments for a high-net-worth client for several years. (In particular, this is insanely important - Geeta **KNOWS MONEY**! She knows how best to keep a company afloat, organize its share structure, provide value to shareholders, etc. because she has worked in the industry before. She may just be the most important element of Fisker Inc., due to the financial experience she has. At every step of the way, she is likely to make decisions with one sole focus - increasing share price and value).

She met her future husband in 2011 when he was visiting London, just before things started going very wrong at Fisker Automotive. They married in 2012.

“When I left Fisker Automotive, all I had was my car,” Henrik remembers. “I'm in a different position, mainly because of Geeta. Because she cuts the deals.”

To get the new venture off the ground, the Fiskers invested the majority of their life savings–an enormous financial risk given the fate of Henrik’s prior company. Then, just as they were locking in plans for the IPO back in July, they were hit by a highly unwelcome complication: Geeta learned she had early-stage breast cancer.

“She got the call (from her doctor) during a call with investors,” Henrik says. Despite that bombshell, she continued working with banks and investors in the weeks that followed, even as she underwent two surgical procedures and radiation therapy. Her medical therapy concluded in November.

Henrik, who marvels at her fortitude throughout the health crisis says, “she only missed something like one day of work...That's just how she is. She works tirelessly.”

## Fisker Ocean

The Fisker Ocean will have a nearly 300-mile range with an 80 kWh battery and a solar panel roof as a range extender, adding approximately 1,000 free miles of range per year. Advanced electronics will be housed under the hood, and the vehicle will incorporate recycled and sustainable materials throughout. Deliveries of the Ocean are scheduled to begin in 2022.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s87j6bdsfw171.png?width=438&format=png&auto=webp&s=e40add9ce53319d31db242cce73a303afb03cbab

Fisker has also announced a partnership with Electrify America to ensure Fisker Ocean vehicles will integrate seamlessly with Electrify America charging stations when the e-SUV hits the market. With features such as a solar roof and recycled inner materials, it will be, according to Fisker Inc., the ""world's most sustainable vehicle.""

In 2017, Fisker Inc. announced that it had filed patents on flexible solid-state battery designs. Fisker expected the batteries to be produced on a mass scale around 2020. A prototype of the battery debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018. In October 2018, Fisker announced new funding for battery development through Caterpillar Venture Capital. The solid-state batteries are intended to deliver longer vehicle range and faster charging times.

In 2018, Fisker was named to the board of directors of First Cobalt, a North American cobalt refinery that produces battery materials.

In September 2019, it was announced that Fisker Inc. was partnering with Game of Thrones actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who will serve as a partner and sustainability adviser to Fisker, to work on advanced, affordable, electric mobility models.

&#x200B;

[In addition to being a well-known actor, Coster-Waldau is also the United Nations Development Program Goodwill Ambassador for climate change and other social issues.](https://preview.redd.it/3hssff5vfw171.png?width=451&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebe55e2468c5b63d1bc0ac3c71547219dff5afaa)

Nikolaj wrote this piece about Fisker:

To quote a friend of mine who is a lot smarter than me, architect Bjarke Ingels: “The idea that sustainability needs to sacrifice quality of life is a flawed one. It’s a design challenge, a challenge to build something that transforms the idea of sustainability into something that will increase the quality of life for all those around it.”

One person meeting that challenge is Henrik Fisker, who has designed some of the most iconic cars over the past decades for BMW and others, like the BMW Z8, Aston Martin DB9 and Aston Martin V8 Vantage. He’s a hero for gas-guzzling supercars. He is a fellow Dane, I am a fan, and we met, of all places, on Twitter.

When we met in person, he described his new project — an all-electric luxury SUV — and asked me if I would help spread the word on his car. The problem as I see it with most electric cars is that they only accomplish the basics. They get you from point A to B. They run electric so you don’t pollute while driving, but that’s it. They are basically unattractive combustion engine cars that have a battery thrown into them — and for most of them, a battery with a limited range. What Fisker does is to try to make every part of the car in a sustainable and attractive way, like a full-length solar roof, recycled floor mats and vegan leather seats. It looks incredibly cool and inviting, with a great 250- to 300-mile range, and at a cost of just under $40,000, it’s a luxury car affordable to a mass market.

I said yes and even became an investor, not only because it’s a great car but more importantly, I hope and believe it can inspire other companies to actively incorporate sustainability goals into all aspects of their business. Fisker then had the idea of calling me “sustainability” adviser. Which I am not. Just to be clear. Thanks Henrik, sounds cool, but I am an actor and a citizen, and that’s really it.

And what about Hollywood? Is our industry changing, are we at the forefront? Looking at social media, you would think so. And things are happening, but usually only when a camera is pointed at people. Remember a few years back when all awards shows only used EVs for the red carpet? We made a difference. We mattered. We showed the way. So cool. So green, so … brief. Now it’s back to the Escalade. But hey, we are not using plastic straws anymore!

To believe that change will come from Hollywood is not really based in reality (when did that stop us?), but we are great at reacting — and things around us are changing, and changing us. I have a good friend who loves his SUV. It’s not electric. But he cannot give up his car. He is a good guy, he’s works for the U.N., so if he has a problem going electric, we all do. But if he is presented with an alternative that doesn’t mean a reduction in his quality of life, something like the Fisker SUV, I think he’d transition to electric in a heartbeat.

The IPO deal values Fisker Inc at US$2.9 billion, with an IPO share price of $10.

On July 30, 2020, Fisker announced plans for a four-vehicle portfolio by 2025. The Fisker Ocean SUV will be joined by a sports sedan based on their previously announced Fisker Emotion concept, a coupe-like SUV, and a lifestyle pickup truck. All will be electric vehicles.

On October 15, 2020, Fisker Inc announced it would be outsourcing vehicle production of its Fisker Ocean electric SUV to Magna Steyr, to reduce the complexities and costs related to the building and operating its own factory. Magna will start building the Fisker Ocean in Europe in 2022.

## Henrik Fisker Interview quotes:

I have people on Twitter saying, “Why don’t you just make the car next month? You have a prototype.” Most people don’t understand that it takes 18 months to do long-lead body tooling for high-volume vehicles. Most people don’t understand it takes two years to do durability tests and do all the engineering certification and everything else.

And on the business model itself, I believe that there is nobody in the near future or the next couple of years that’s going to make a million EVs on one model. Today, there’s nobody doing it. Tesla probably has the highest volume of one single model, a couple hundred thousand. But even the big giant established carmakers are not making, right now, a couple hundred thousand vehicles of one model. So the way you get volume, in my view, is if you partner up with other OEMs and share some of the expensive parts of the platform, which in my view is not anymore something that is unique IP or something that is a unique experience to the customer. An aluminum stamped floor or a steel stamped floor really doesn’t have any brand value anymore.

And obviously, as we move forward, we always start to do some of the things ourselves. But it was really about de-risking in our first vehicle to market. So we’re going to do another three vehicles, which we can do because we don’t have to spend all our money and effort on learning how to manufacture a car, for instance.

So we have programmed a lot. We have hired a head of ESG, environmental and social governance, and he is really spearheading developing specific... we kind of put out some goals that we would like to reach with suppliers, and we at least try to bring them in that direction. They are not reaching those goals right now, but they may reach them later. And then we have goals for ourselves. So for instance, we look at transport. Are we choosing a supplier that’s closer to the plant, or are we choosing a supplier that’s on the other side of the planet that way we have to then transport all that stuff. So those are the types of things that we’re really thinking about now as we’re nominating suppliers. And finally, materials as well, looking at sustainable materials. We’ve actually picked up a lot of knowledge on that side as well, where we are adding more sustainable materials to our vehicle. So we are actually looking across everything — supply chain, where the suppliers are located, what the suppliers are doing for sustainability, and also then of course in the vehicle itself — in terms of the type of materials there.

▪ Magna architecture in development since 2018. Without FF-PAD, Fisker would have needed to be involved from that date.

Fisker targets 4 unique vehicle models on the market by 2025YE

MEDIUM-TERM OPERATING MODEL:

Targeting annual volume of 200,000-250,000 units by 2025 (under review pending finalized agreement with Foxconn)

Projecting mid-$50k Avg. selling price (ASP) at Ocean maturity (slightly below midpoint of price range)

Platform-sharing, contract manufacturing, outsourced service, digital sales / distribution, and organic marketing supports meaningfully lower OpEx spend vs. competitors.

So - let's summarize - prices are rising at their fastest pace in almost 30 years and incomes just plunged by their most ever! We're gonna need more stimmies!""  

Plus  to above; 

Last year, Hirschman Capital noted that since 1821, 98% of sovereigns that hit 130% debt/GDP have defaulted on their sovereign debt.   

The US hit 130% late last year. 

Simple Conclussion : The Fed can’t go “hawkish” and raise rates without sending markets –and economies–to their knees; by extension, they now have nothing left to “cut” when the current everything bubble implodes.

And that  is a *real problem*.

 There are only two ways for sovereigns to default: 

Inflation or collapse.    

The latter is not an option. 

 As for a solution, what’s so tragic is that the only option before the Fed is an even bigger problem—current and inevitably more inflation. 

 That is, if the Fed wants to keep markets (and their job security) breathing, they no longer have the foregoing template of “rate-hike-followed-by-rate-cutting” at their disposal, which means they now have no choice but to dovishly keep rates near the zero-bound indefinitely.

But the only way to keep rates “controlled” and nailed to the floor of time is to purchase otherwise unwanted bonds to keep their prices elevated and hence yields and rates repressed.

Such bond “accommodation,” of course, costs money, and as we already know, the only “money” the Fed has to spend is the kind they create out of thin air– the very kind of money (and policy) which leads to the kind of inflation discussed above—namely, the brutal kind.

 As for that fake money, the evidence of the Fed’s desperate (and only) direction is now obvious, as the following M2 money supply makes equally clear. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v774ta55sw171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e73c839beb67a67eea9aed7de4ac61d86813840

 

Fed is so embarrassed by this “printing solution” that they’ve stopped *weekly* reporting of M2 data, and frankly, since March, have even stopped *monthly* reporting of the same.

That, of course, is both telling as well as disgraceful… The Fed literally has something to hide, and that never bodes well, does it?

&#x200B;

 The correlation to central bank balance sheet (i.e., money supply) expansion and rising markets is now beyond dispute. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sgizb6xcsw171.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=aad2fe681fe0c49ac20368aba77e86c118b22959

 In short—do you see the correlation and pattern? Do you see how the Fed’s market sausage is made? More importantly, do you now see the Fed’s self-made conundrum? 

 

Given that the Fed bows to the markets not the people, which choice do you think they’ll make?

In other words, expect more money printing and more yield curve control—and hence more money creation, more inflation, and by extension more fiat currency debasement.

 More money supply to keep rates monetized simply means more currency debasement and rising inflation.","""Fed's ""Favorite"" #Inflation Indicator (PCE) Explodes At Fastest Rate Since 1992 As Incomes Crash By Record""",,

I have leading indicators telling me that there are two concurrent shifts underway when it comes to who is purchasing homes.

\- Massive increase in unmarried people buying houses alone. This used to be somewhat unusual, now it's becoming very common.

\- Massive increase in unmarried men, in particular, buying houses alone. Traditionally, the female-to-male ratio of unmarried homebuyers was about 5 to 1. For the last 3 months, it's been closer to 50/50.

Source is my own closed real estate purchase transactions. Am a mortgage broker (btw this means cash purchases are ""invisible"" to me). It takes 3-6 months for [HMDA data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Mortgage_Disclosure_Act) to become accessible to journalists and academics, and thus ""visible"" to the general public (assuming journalists deem it worthy of commenting on), but I can see the trends live in real time.

How would one go about placing a bet that in about 3 or 6 months, the media, journalists, academics, etc, will pick up on this, publish articles, and potentially cause a lot of people to buy certain stocks. Which stocks would that be? Is there a ""Mancave, Inc"" out there that would potentially get an uptick? Or maybe a company making smart-home stuff that is particularly suited to renting by the room (the single men are not buying 1 bedroom condos, they are buying proper houses with 3 bedrooms, etc)?

EDIT: oh, and to be clear. It's not just an uptick in single men. It's an uptick in women too, but a massive surge from the men. It used to be that for 15 banana sales, 10 are to married couples, 4 to single women, and 1 to a single man. Now for the same 15 banana sales, it's 6 to married couples, 6 to single women, and 3 to single men, something like that.",Homebuyer Demographics Shift towards single and male. How to bet?,,

It was on a Thursday night 02/25/2021 when I posted, at the time RKT was around 19-20 range and on the following Monday 03/01/2021 it started rallying, by 03/02 & 03/03 it hit the ATH level 43. You’re welcome to find my last DD post for verification. And for those of you who made tendies on it congratulations to you all! Spread the good energy!

As I am writing this post Today is 05/28/2021, I’ll try to bring more data and technical analysis on $RKT, as you all saw what happened yesterday 05/27/2021 around lunch time upon sudden move it went from 17.50 area all the way to 19.40. This move doesn’t seem so random at all, a combination of someone noticed this to be a strategic technical squeeze just testing the water after it being suppressed down for the past 3 months, and you can see how fast the shorts started covering all of a sudden.

Today 05/28/2021, at opening it shot up to $19.20 but the shorts came prepared for $RKT this morning with their analysts and news blasting numerous articles and downgrades from Morgan Stanley, Wedbush & Zacks, ALL AT ONCE. This is certainly no coincidence.

On the technical side, on the daily chart as you can see it has a gap to fill around 22.67 area then it’ll go straight to 28 and has a huge potential to pass beyond that and make it to a new all-time high, there’s nothing stopping it. On the daily MACD closed red and turned green, RSI is at the same level as last time before it squeezed to ATH $43, Parabolic S.A.R indicator flipped from red on the daily to green for the first time in 3 months. Another important factor is as you look at the volume and candle compared to last time it exploded (both red arrows) same volume, same price action.

Conclusion: the shorts are basically scared sh\*tless right now and they know it, is a tickle to the trigger for it to explode again like last time or even higher. Based on Excess Returns Model the fair value for RKT is $85, so why haven't we seen $100 yet?

I am no financial advisor and this is not a recommendation, just knowledge I would like to share.. Heres to Vertex Energy and why I think it won't stop rising in price for the next few days...

First off, we have the $75 million deal to buy the Mobile refinery in Alabama from Royal Dutch Shell PLC which is expected to close by the end of the year, and would be the largest and most significant transaction Vertex has ever completed.

With the additional $85 million conversion of the Mobile refinery's hydrocracking unit, Vertex expects the refinery will have the potential to generate at least $3 billion in annual sales and $400 million of gross profit annually beginning in 2023.

As part of this transaction, Vertex will assume ownership of more than 3 million barrels of crude oil and product storage, together with other valuable logistics assets. Our vision for this site is that of diversification. We will seek to lead the southeast region in marketing next generation fuels and products that are not currently produced by the refinery today.

Vertex will become the sole owner and operator of the refinery upon closing. The refinery, which has a long track record of safe, reliable operations and consistent financial performance, will become Vertex's flagship refining asset upon the close of the transaction, positioning the Company to become a pure-play producer of renewable and conventional products. Highly attractive transaction economics, pro-forma for renewable diesel fuel project.

Still with me? Ok, so...

Vertex expects the average gross profit per barrel on its renewable diesel production will be significantly higher than that of the Mobile refinery's conventional fuels production, including the benefit of tax subsidies and carbon-reduction incentives. As this project involves the conversion of an existing, operating process unit, Vertex anticipates that both the capital cost and anticipated time-to-market will be significantly less than that of comparable greenfield conversion projects.​

Also, here's what Alvaro Ruiz, EVP of Corporate Development at Vertex had to say:

""As part of this transaction, we plan to enter into a multi-year crude supply and product offtake agreements with several highly-respected counterparties, including Shell, who has been an exceptional partner throughout the sale process. We believe these agreements will position us to reduce our working capital requirements, while mitigating spot market risk on product sales. Upon closing, we expect to hedge a significant portion of the first-year production, reducing our near-term exposure to movements in refined product margins, as we focus on completing the planned asset conversion, which remains the most significant near-term economic driver resulting from this transaction.""

BIG NEWS BOYS AND GIRLS​
Most importantè piece of info, right here:⤵️


PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION: Vertex intends to enter into a multi-year product off-take agreement with Shell, while continuing to supply Bunker Holding (""Bunker One"") under an existing 10-year agreement. Under the agreements, Shell and Bunker One will purchase 100% of the Mobile refinery's conventional fuels production. Concurrent with this arrangement, Vertex will enter into a separate, long-term agreement under which Idemitsu Apollo Corporation, a wholly-owned California-based subsidiary of Idemitsu Kosan, will purchase 100% of the Mobile refinery's renewable diesel fuel production. The sale of all conventional and unconventional fuels will be priced against spot market index prices.​

Okay, whew, that was beginning to strain MY eyes.. Here's - to me, the best thing out of all this info and the best for our future as a cleaner environment: 

Renewable diesel is a biofuel that can be produced from organic waste and vegetable oils. Renewable diesel is a sustainable, fungible replacement for petroleum-based diesel fuel. While California remains the primary market for domestically produced renewable diesel, given the economic benefits for its use under the state's Low Carbon Fuel Standard, other states are expected to follow suit, creating significant, incremental demand during the next decade. Once operable, the Mobile refinery's converted hydrocracking unit will be capable of processing a wide range of organic, pre-treated feedstocks, including soybean and corn oil, meat tallow and waste vegetable oils, among others.​

&#x200B;

\*\*\* If you aren't in TSM ( ***Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing***) you hate money. Here are some reasons you should look into this stock and buy it before it is too late. \*\*\*

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Economics 101, Supply and Demand.**

* TSM is the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the world
* THERE IS A WORLDWIDE SEMICONDUCTOR SHORTAGE
* Let me emphasize this point. THERE IS A WORLDWIDE SEMICONDUCTOR SHORTAGE

As many of you know, there is a worldwide semiconductor shortage (yes I said it again). These semiconductors are vital components in every electronic we use today. Without these semiconductors, things like smartphones, automobiles, video game consoles, etc. Would not be able to function.

(Read the following if you want to see why these semiconductors are so vital...or just completely trust me, that's fine too)

***\*ALL COMPUTERS NEEDS SEMICONDUCTORS TO FUNCTION\****

Semiconductors are used primarily in electronic devices, including chips, diodes, transistors, and integrated circuits. Anything that is computerized or uses radio waves depends on semiconductors. Your phone is a computer, your car is a computer, your video game consoles are computers, your amazon firestick is a computer, every aspect of your life is dependent on these semiconductors.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do you believe the future of automobiles are powered by electric? Not without semiconductors.

**Semiconductors in Automobiles**

1. **Vehicle electrification –** Semiconductors have made it possible to replace manual systems with electrical systems. Electrification of key systems provides benefits such as increased vehicle efficiency, reductions in carbon emissions, and minimizing oil dependency.
2. **Safety and driver assistance –** The increasing need for better safety and driver assistance systems in cars has provided a niche for semiconductors. Intelligent functions such as backup cameras, blind-spot detection, adaptive cruise control, lane change assist, airbag deployment, and emergency braking systems are all made possible through the integration of semiconductor technologies.
3. **Connectivity –** Cars are increasingly incorporating technology that improves their connectivity. New vehicles on the market include ever-more sophisticated telematics (long-distance data transmission) and infotainment capabilities which feed drivers information on factors such as road closures, collision avoidance, and even free parking spaces at their destination. On-board computers which handle this information have to process millions of lines of code every second. Semiconductors allow cars to stay connected in real-time.

Semiconductors are key to the future of the electric vehicle (EV) industry as they help to control the powertrain and battery. Semiconductors are also used in the variety of touchscreens that are installed in the driver’s dash and in the back of passenger seats.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**FINANCIALS/NEWS**

* Financially, the company has reported its third straight quarter of record sales in its first-quarter earnings report back in April.
* Its revenue came in 25.4% higher year-over-year to 12.9 billion.
* The stock has more than doubled in price over the past year
* Japan’s government recently announced that it wants TSM and Sony to invest $9.2 billion to build the country’s first 20-nanometer chip plant.
* Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) said on Friday (5/21/2021) that it has increased its 2021 output for a key component for automotive semiconductors by 60% compared with last year, amid a global chip shortage.

These are just a couple of things. If This has caught your eye please research TSM on your own and you can find more great news and financial statements...or don't, you've made it this far, might as well go all in.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 31st, 2021.

# **A big jobs report looms in the week ahead, as markets enter the often-weak month of June - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/28/jobs-report-looms-in-the-week-ahead-as-markets-enter-the-often-weak-month-of-june.html)**
*****
> May’s employment report is the big event in the week ahead, as stocks enter the often weak month of June. Stocks are finishing May with a mixed performance. Big cap indexes like the S&P 500 and Dow notched gains. The S&P rose a half percent, and the Dow rose 1.9%. The small cap Russell 2000 was flat, up 0.1%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq declined 1.5%.
*****
> June is not historically a strong month for stocks. Bespoke Investment Group points out that over the past 50 years, the Dow has gained just 0.12% in June and has been positive 52% of the time.
*****
> But over the past 20 years, June was far weaker, gaining only 40% of the time. June’s performance is tied with September as the worst month of the year, with an average Dow decline of 0.7%, according to Bespoke.
*****
> The economy is front and center in the coming week with the important ISM readings on manufacturing and services sector activity, but the most important measure will be Friday’s jobs report. According to Dow Jones, economists expect Friday’s employment report to show the creation of about 674,000 jobs in May, after the disappointing 266,000 jobs added in April. That was about a quarter of what economists had expected.
*****
> “You know if we have two months in a row of not delivering on the jobs expectations, the market is going to get nervous,” said George Goncalves, head of U.S. macro strategy at MUFG. “Hopefully, we beat it and then that creates a positive buzz, and we go into the Fed meeting and then we’re, ‘Hey, the economy is still on track.’”
*****
> # Big June event
> The Fed meets June 15-16, and already market pros are anticipating it will be the most important event of the month. Fed officials have emphasized that they will keep policy easy as they watch to see signs that the economy is really healing. They also contend that higher inflation readings are temporary, since the data is being compared with a weak period last year.
*****
> Key for the markets is whether the Fed begins to believe that inflation is higher than it expected or that the economy is strengthening enough to progress without so much monetary support. Fed officials have said they would consider discussing tapering back on their quantitative easing bond purchase program if they see signs of improvement, and that would be a first step toward interest rate hikes, not expected until at least 2023.
*****
> If inflation runs too hot, the Fed’s main weapon to combat it is to raise interest rates.
*****
> The prospect of higher interest rates makes the stock market nervous, since it would mean higher costs for companies and less liquidity. In theory, higher interest rates also means that investors could potentially choose higher-yielding bond investments over stocks.
*****
> The next big read for the economy is Friday’s jobs report, and it looms large as recent inflation readings have come in much hotter than expected. The latest was the personal consumption expenditures price index Friday. It showed core inflation running at 3.1% year over year, the strongest reading for that measure since 1992.
*****
> The Fed’s beige book on the economy is expected Wednesday. ISM manufacturing data is expected Tuesday, and ISM services is released Thursday. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks on central banks and climate change at Green Swan 2021 global virtual conference Friday.
*****
> # Inflation flare-up
> The Fed has said it would tolerate an average range of inflation around its 2% target until it sees inflation sticking at a higher level. Inflation has been running mostly below 2%, prior to the latest numbers.
*****
> “With the PCE number coming in like every other inflation number over the last six weeks, hotter than expected, the market is inching closer to calling the Fed out on its view that inflation is transitory,” said Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy at BTIG.
*****
> Emanuel said the speculative activity around meme stocks this week is a sign of froth and shows a large amount of liquidity in the hands of investors. One of those stocks, AMC, closed off 1.5% on Friday after rallying 116% in the past week, giving it a 2021 gain of 1,200%.
*****
> “The net net on the index level is basically it’s a stock market that’s moving sideways,” Emanuel said. “Our view continues to be that when you look at it longer term, the big picture is this is a bull market that started in March of last year that has further to run. When you look at it in the medium term, the market has every right to be concerned and we do believe they will amp up their concern that the Fed’s paying insufficient attention to price stability.”
*****
> Emanuel said he studied what happened to stocks when core PCE was above the Fed’s 2% target. “The average monthly return for months where the core PCE has been over 2%, going back to 1989 is (a decline) of 1.6%, with a decided bias toward more defensive sectors like health care outperforming and a very pronounced bias for technology of all kinds to underperform,” he said.
*****
> Technology stocks, as measured by the S&P information technology sector, gained 1.6% in the past month, and are up 5.9% year to date. The sector is lagging the S&P 500′s 12% gain.
*****
> The top-performing sectors have been cyclical year to date, with energy up 36.2%, financials up 28.5%, materials up 20.1% and industrials up 18.3%. Communications services, which contains some internet growth names, gained 16% since the start of the year. Health care has been outperforming information technology, up 8.6% year to date.
*****
> In the past week, the S&P 500 gained 1.2% to 4,204 and is within 1% of its all-time high. The Dow rose 0.9% to 34,529, and the Nasdaq was up 2% at 13,748.
*****
> # Red flag?
On the edges of the financial markets, market pros are paying attention to signs of a huge surge of liquidity in the financial system. In the past week, institutions have been placing unprecedented amounts of cash with the Fed, nearly a half trillion dollars Thursday.
*****
> “There’s way too much liquidity in the system, and it’s happening as a result of the Fed’s ongoing QE, but also disbursements from the fiscal stimulus,” said Goncalves.
*****
> He said the funds from trillions in stimulus, including to state and local governments, have not yet been spent but have found their way into the banking system. At the same time, institutions and individuals continue to move funds into money market funds, now holding about $4.6 trillion.
*****

> # Days After Memorial Day Improving

> Our office will be closed for observance of Memorial Day on Monday, May 31, 2021. U.S stock and bond markets will also be closed. As you spend some quality time off please consider taking time to commemorate those who have paid the ultimate price while serving in the U.S. military. Additionally, consider taking a moment to acknowledge first responders, nurses, doctors, law enforcement, firefighters, essential workers, scientists and everyone else that has tirelessly worked and sacrificed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

> For decades the Stock Trader’s Almanac has been tracking and monitoring the market’s performance around holidays. The trading day after Memorial Day has a mixed record going back to 1971. Both S&P 500 and NASDAQ have declined more often than risen on the day, but average performance is still modestly positive.

> Since 1986, the frequency of gains has improved, and average performance has also risen however, but S&P 500 declined five straight days after 2015-2019. The second trading day after Memorial Day has more advances than declines, but average performance is negative for NASDAQ. The third day after appears to have the best long- and short-term record combined with solid average performance.

> # Post-Election-Year June: Third Worst S&P 500 Month

> June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks over the last 50 years as a rule ranking sixth with a 0.9% average gain, up 28 of 50 years. This contributes to NASDAQ’s “Best Eight Months” which ends in June. June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.2%. S&P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking ninth, but essentially flat (0.1% average gain). Small caps also tend to fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.8% in the month since 1979.

> In post-election years since 1953, June still ranks poorly and its average loss for DJIA increases to –1.1% while S&P 500′s modestly positive performance becomes a 0.6% loss. DJIA struggles the most, advancing in just four post-election year Junes (1977, 1985, 1997 and 2017). Russell 2000 fares best, up seven times in ten years with an average gain of 1.2%. NASDAQ lands in the middle, advancing 50% of the time with an average gain of 0.4%.

> # Checking the Gauges: Economic Surprise Indexes

> In terms of whether economic data is either beating or missing economists’ forecasts, it appears conditions may now be a bit better overseas. Driven by some improving COVID-19 trends, the economic backdrop has improved overseas, while high economic expectations have proved to be a more formidable hurdle here in the U.S. This improvement has helped to steady the foundation in many non-U.S. equity markets, and has caused us to improve our outlook for developed non-U.S. stocks. We believe the improving COVID-19 trends in Europe could be particularly sticky as vaccine distribution becomes more widespread.

> For several years now, being underweight European equities, relative to the U.S., has been a winning trade. A sea-change in that thinking could be approaching as value-heavy European indices have gotten some attention with the improvement from value, but a firm, constructive view of European equities may still be some ways off.

> The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index, or CESI, tracks how the economic data fare compared with expectations. The index rises when economic data exceeds Bloomberg consensus estimates and falls when data is below forecasts. As shown in the LPL Chart of the day, economically, global conditions remain rather strong, as evidenced by these indices, which remain above the zero line. This reflects economic data coming in better than expected in several geographic regions. The repair of global trade activity, as supply lines are reconnected, has been notably key in non-U.S. data outcomes.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/blog-chart-5.27.21.png?ssl=1))**

> Looking ahead, we expect now elevated economic expectations, particularly in the U.S., may prove a tougher target. As a result “economic surprises,” both in the U.S. and abroad, may fade as we move through the year. However, the overall global growth trajectory is expected to continue to be robust through 2021. Global real GDP contracted 3.3% in 2020, and it is expected to rise to +6.0% in 2021, according to Bloomberg’s consensus estimate, before ticking down to +3.4% in 2022.

> “Although high U.S. economic expectations could be tough to beat for the remainder of 2021, we still believe U.S. stocks should make up a material portion of equity portfolios. And even though economic expectations are being more readily exceeded overseas, it is tough to overlook U.S. companies’ innovation and profitability advantages.” explained LPL Financial Director of Research Marc Zabicki.

> # More and More Investors Are Looking For A Correction

> The S&P 500 has been hovering around 0.5% below its record highs this week, but without a true test of those highs, sentiment has not moved very far. The American Association of Individual Investors' weekly reading on bullish sentiment fell from 37% last week down to 36.4%. While that is the second week in a row with an absolute move less than a full percentage point in size, the marginally lower reading does leave bullish sentiment at the lowest level since the end of October.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052721-AAII-Bull.png))**

> Bearish sentiment moved by even less, only rising 0.1 percentage points. At 26.4%, it still is below the reading of 27% from the first week of the month. Outside of that reading, that is the highest level since February.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052721-AAII-Bear.png))**

> This week's moves left the bull-bear spread little changed at 10. That's down 0.7 points from last week but still above the 9.5 reading from two weeks ago.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052721-AAII-BB-Spread.png))**

> Once again, the highest percentage of investors are in the neutral camp at 37.1%. As was the case last week, that makes for the highest level in neutral sentiment since the first week of 2020 when it stood north of 40%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052721-AAII-Neut.png))**

> Pivoting over to sentiment for equity newsletter writers measured in the Investors Intelligence survey, there were some more interesting moves. Bullish and bearish sentiments were not necessarily anything to gawk at similar to the AAII survey. Bullish sentiment has been on the decline with this week's survey showing a 3 percentage point drop to 51.5%, the lowest level since March 10th. Meanwhile, bearish sentiment moderated from 17.2 to 16.8%. That was the same level as the start of the month.

> The percentage of respondents ""looking for a correction"" was more notable. Rather than simply asking whether or not respondents foresee a correction in the technical sense on the horizon (a 10% decline from a high), Investors Intelligence defines a newsletter writer as ""looking for a correction"" when they are bullish on a list of stocks but at a lower price point. Coming in at 31.7%, the reading is a few percentage points above the historical average of 27.6% and is in the top quartile of the historical range. In other words, it is an elevated reading albeit far from without precedence. What is more significant is that it has been over a year since this part of the survey has seen these levels.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052721-II-Correction.png))**

> In the history of the survey dating back to 1963, there have only been eight other times that the percentage of newsletter writers looking for a correction has crossed above 30% for the first time in at least a year. The most recent of these was in April 2009. In the table below we show the S&P 500's performance in the year following those occurrences. As shown, performance has been generally positive across those past instances with average gains over the following weeks and months and moves higher at least 75% of the time one month, three months, and one year out. Additionally, while there were two times, 1982 and 2009, in which the S&P 500 rallied over the following year without looking back, there were another two times, 2001 and 2007, that at the following years' lows, the S&P 500 would end up lower by double-digit percentage points.

**TL;DR  BEAR CASE: OXY HAS DOGSHIT FOR A BALANCESHEET AND THIS MAY KEEP  INVESTORS AWAY REGARDLESS OF EVERYTHING IT HAS GOING FOR IT DUE TO  CURRENT MARKET UNCERTAINTY AND GENERAL OIL FUD, POTENTIALLY  OPEC/RUSSIA/WHATEVER HANDLES THE UNLIKELY POSSIBILITY OF LIFTED IRANIAN  SANCTIONS POORLY AND CRASHES OIL PRICES**

**TL;DR  BULL CASE: OXY HAS DOGSHIT FOR A BALANCESHEET AND THUS INVESTOR FEAR  HAS LEFT THE STOCK SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERVALUED WITH MODERATE IMMEDIATE  UPSIDE (1-2 weeks, $26 > $31) AND 2-3x POTENTIAL BY END OF YEAR,  BEING ONE OF THE COMPANIES BEST POSITIONED TO PROFIT OFF THE PRESENT AND  NAVIGATE THE FUTURE OF THE OIL INDUSTRY**

We  live in oily times. This has been the case since the dawn of the  petroleum industry; it is the lifeblood of the world, almost quite  literally, and our first fears of oil were that we would drain the  planet dry. Now, consensus is shifting towards the real issue with  reliance upon fossil fuels - if we keep up as we have been, we will end  all life on the planet in quite a different way. Climate change is real,  and the mainstream narrative has finally caught up - with covid slowly  fading away, and an era of relative peace (apart from the middle east  exploding as usual and china slowly buying the world), it is going to  become the hottest topic on our plates and people are going to be  feeling very angry about the prime culprits, big oil. This has already  started, last week, with the first strikes hitting Shell and Exxon, and I  have absolutely no doubt that similar incidents will continue to sweep  across the industry, especially once we hit full reopening and the media  needs its next big fix of drama. For those invested or who are  considering investing in the oil industry, we live in uncertain times,  but again, we live in oily times. I truly believe that the energy/oil  sector will fully recover from COVID and begin to absolutely take off  over the next few years, but not without a significant degree of  turbulence regarding oil companies. This will not be based around  fundamentals, but fear. For this reason, I feel that Occidental  Petroleum is the best positioned company to weather the potential media  circus, profit off the rising prices of oil and make absolute bank as  they begin to shift into carbon capture, which is what I believe to be  the future of oil companies in an attempt to remain carbon neutral  without massive restructuring and countless stranded assets. Much of  what I'm saying will apply to many small-midcap petroleum companies, but  I like OXY the most - and I love the technical setup, which I can't say  for other strong candidates like Devon Energy (DVN)

**SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

Oil  players cutting production without a meaningful reduction in demand is  massively bullish for oil. The lower the supply, the higher the demand,  and thus the higher the price of any given commodity. If the oil  industry is forced to restrict oil extraction, the first companies on  the block for being strong armed into lowering production are going to  be the supermajors. OXY is not a supermajor, and has already lowered  production/plans to keep production lowered this year (and leaned out  significantly, as they are now profitable at around $30bbl if I read  correctly). Therefore, reduced production from the supermajors in a  sector that is already likely to hit a supply crunch sometime this year  is bullish for all small-midcap oil producers, and although they have  seen good quarterly results, many of them are yet to recover to  pre-covid levels.

**TECHNICALS**

I'm  still too poor to afford crayons, but the long and short of it is this:  On March 5th 2021, oil closed at $66.27bbl. OXY was valued at $31.23  per share. On May 28th 2021, oil closed at $66.66bbl. Aside from this  being very bullish for Satan - the price of OXY at close was $25.96.  This, to me, makes no sense at all, given that OXY could be considered  as a highly levered company regarding oil prices. The price of oil did  not spike as rapidly as it did in March, but right now it feels to be in  a very clear uptrend, and has demonstrated a level of stability that  March did not. Moreso, OXY posted strong earnings and an EPS beat, but  they have been unable to recover recent highs, and pre-covid highs still  seem to be a distant dream, though entirely realistic within my eyes.  To me, this lack of positive price action is purely because of FUD -  people aren't sure what to make of oil right now, because they're smooth  brained retards. The bottom line is the bottom line; OXY and friends  are making big bucks, and the more restrictions the industry as a whole  finds itself slapped with, the higher the cost of oil, which leads to  greater benefit for small-medium players. Or, potentially, bankruptcy,  but I think OXY's investment in carbon capture is their silver bullet  which will give them safe haven and even greater appeal in the face of  future uncertainty.

**CARBON CAPTURE**

OXY  has significant interest in carbon capture. This is sort of beyond the  scope of this DD, but essentially, carbon capture is used to sequester  carbon - and in this case, this captured carbon is used to pump more oil  out of the ground. I personally believe it's going to be an incredibly  helpful and possibly even necessary technology, and I think if  restrictions do pass in regards to oil drilling, it's going to come also  in the form of regulations mandating an amount of carbon capture per  output. I'm aware that there's quite a lot of debate regarding the  actual usefulness of carbon capture, but it has clear and undeniable  benefit in oil drilling and regardless: governments throw money at  nonsense all the time, and even if it is ultimately an ineffective  method I believe that carbon capture is likely to see significant  interest and investment. It is entirely possible that OXY becomes an  industry leader in this respect, and it would mark a ridiculously  lucrative pivot when combined with their current position in oil. This  could easily see them reaching the ranks of the supermajors, if these  companies are unable to keep up with the current state of change and can  find no appropriate pivot themselves.

THE SHORT TERM PLAY

**The  price of oil has been inching towards testing 5 year highs over the  past week, having pushed past 52w highs on the Friday but closing lower  on the day. I believe this is for a single reason, one which will have  resolved by the 1st of June. We're currently in a long weekend with an  OPEC meeting on Tuesday, and the Iranian oil sanction FUD is still  weighing heavily on the market. Thus, it would have been foolish to buy  into a stock position over the last few days when next week will give  much greater clarity - hence why a number of oil equities have remained  somewhat flat compared to similar price action in March - since it is  not entirely clear in which direction oil prices will go right now and a  lot can change over a long weekend into an OPEC meeting.**

**Personally,  I believe that oil prices will go right the fuck up. OPEC is unlikely  to deviate from their plan, and will very likely talk on how they would  handle the potential reintroduction of Iranian oil to the market. This,  coming off of the memorial day weekend being a psychological marker that  things are ""back to normal"", with the weeks following being  historically bullish for the market in general, the current concerns on  inflation, the stories on oil majors cutting back production and the  ongoing tensions in the middle east makes me think we see oil cross  $68bbl by next week and, without a significant pullback, $70bbl by mid  June.**

**Therefore,  the play is simple. Check oil price movement immediately following the  OPEC meeting on Tuesday, and if it's stable or moving up, buy July 9th  OXY calls at a $28 strike - my price target being $33. So long as oil  doesn't crash back below $65, I have no doubt that OXY will retrace to  at least $30 by July 9th, which is a comfortable 100% profit at current  prices - I also expect an IV bump following OPEC, as there should be  some large buys as funds rush to reposition themselves in oil stocks  once the FUD clears. A few of the stocks in this sector - OXY and RIG in  particular - are quite prone to posting 10% to 15% green days out of  nowhere, and OXY is well overdue for one. Overall, these stocks have  been lagging in confidence compared to March, even with more stable  price action and higher highs - I expect a correction to the upside very  soon.**

THE LONG TERM PLAY

In the unlikely even that oil tanks after the OPEC meeting, we move to long term - buy OXY calls or shares at *whatever price they've dipped to the next time oil is around $58-$60bb*l,  because that feels like a historically strong level of support and  should hold even stronger given the current monetary environment. As  long as oil is above $55bbl, OXY is sitting in a pretty profitable  space, so a significant drop in price if oil drops to around the $60bbl  mark would indicate the stock being oversold compared to fundamentals,  and it's likely to pop back up around the Q2/Q3 earnings.

Buy  and hold for 5-10 years and I see a relatively safe 3-5x. Boomer shit,  and I bet they'll even up their dividend by then, but I think 2023 calls  are a bit unpredictable - 2022 are likely to print, I like $40s, but  things might get choppy past then. Still, even with their level of debt,  I don't see OXY as among the companies that may go under during the  coming massive shifts in the oil industry, and I believe that they will  be debt free within a few years and successfully pivot to carbon capture  and make a new name for themselves there. Potentially literally, given  that Total is now TotalEnergies, and Petroleum is going to go the way of  the gamer word.

**BEAR CASE**

There's  really not much here to be bearish about; it depends on the price  movement of oil and investor sentiment about large debtors. Personally I  believe that OXY will have a significantly cleaner balance sheet by end  of year, and given some stability in the price of oil above $60bbl I  think most investors will come around to that fact, too, but given the  general uncertainty in the market - strangely absent this week, as it  was overall bullish - OXY is not the safest investment, and the smart  money required to move the needle on an established and ""problem"" large  cap significantly might be absent for a few years yet, until some  definite stability and repayment of debt is found.

Also,  OXY did some potentially really stupid shit hedging oil prices and  their profits are capped at oil being $75bbl. Personally, I think this  is fine, as I see oil capping out at around $75bbl for the year, but  expect OXY stock price to hit a ceiling around there if crude does  breach $75 this year. At which point, I would advise either DVN or RIG  as they have much more room to run in a significant oil bull market.

Thanks for reading, if you have.

Good  luck to all; this is one of the ideas I have been more confident on  this year, and since I have made a fair bit of money off of various DDs  shared here (and I fucking hate what this place has become by the way,  but shout out to steel gang), I have wanted to give back in some way.","The state (and future) of oil, an OXY - Occidental Petroleum - trade idea.",,

I’ll give my view also. Especially where I differ. 

Always starts with team. This team is top. Went through their LinkedIn pages and all of them are all stars. That’s seems like a great place to start. 

FINTECH
Not to mention they just got Jackie Reese from Square $SQ recently took over and looks like Wish could be a big #Fintech play with 100m users. They launched buy now and pay later recently. 

Also Palantir cofounder is on the board and CEO is one of the early Google search engine technologists. 

53k! LOCAL MERCHANTS- SOMETHING NO OTHER COMPANY HAS
They recently launched Wish Local. They partner with local merchants to sell goods in the local communities but using their app as the online face. 53k are on the platform. This allows them to deliver goods same day, buy online pick up same day, and Wish Express that is 5 days or less shipping. This also brings in traffic to merchants. So everyone is winning. 


30% OF MARKET CAP IS CASH NO DEBT
They trade at 1x sales. Grew it over 50%. 

LOGISTICS ON FIRE
This revenue is on fire. Growing over 2x and they mentioned this will soon make profit. They said they are offering to companies NOT selling on Wish. They just started this effort. This means someone selling on Shopify or other marketplaces can sell globally using their network. Not really possible before. 

Obviously there’s risks but it also seems like the risks have come down dramatically with share decline. 

Not only this. Short interest is high and I think reason for selling is private funds selling shares after lockup.",Time to make a WISH,,

1. GME's breakout candle, on Thursday, January 13th and AMC's breakout candle, on Wednesday, May 13th are almost identical
2. After both breakouts, they traded above the bollinger bands for 3 back to back sessions
3. After GME's breakout, we saw a consolidation of price action for 5 trading sessions
4. After AMC's breakout we saw a consolidation of price action for 7 trading sessions
5. From GME's low on it's initial breakout to it's high the Friday before the squeeze, we saw on increase of 283%
6. From AMC's low on it's initial breakout to it's high the Friday before the potential squeeze, we saw an increase of 245%

&#x200B;

This is where things get interesting...

&#x200B;

The bullish candle that was formed for GME on Friday, January 22nd looks ALOT like the bullish candle formed on Thursday, May 27th for AMC

The spinning top candle that was formed for GME on Monday, Jan 25th looks alot like the spinning top candle formed on Friday, May 28th for AMC

&#x200B;

Taking into consideration the market is closed on memorial day, is this history repeating itself? If it is, that would mean the squeeze will start next week? Now I don't want to attach certain dates, I'm just sharing more information with you all. You be the judge of it.

Amazon has been looking into this idea even before the pandemic, and delayed its plans because of the pandemic. Essentially, Amazon has a bunch of excess stock of computer equipment in its warehouses that they really just want to get rid of (since it costs money to store). Instead of throwing it out they would prefer to sell it - even at a big discount. This is likely stuff like older graphics cards, monitors, computers etc. This solves a key issue with Gamestop's business model: Gamestop's margin's suck. Selling computer equipment that would have just been thrown out anyway means that every dollar sold is a dollar saved.

&#x200B;

Here's the original news report for anyone who wants more information:

&#x200B;

**2: A number of ex-Amazon executives already work at Gamestop in the C-Suite**

Due to this - the cultures of the companies are likely to become very similar and people at Amazon and Gamestop are likely to have worked together in the past. This makes any type of business combination much easier

&#x200B;

Here's a couple (I'm sure you guys can add more to this list): 

Chief Growth Officer (CGO):  Elliott Wilke 

Chief Operating Officer (COO):  Jenna Owens

**3: A clean exit from a short selling debacle**

Many people have floated around theories of naked short selling, imaginary shares, etc. No matter if you believe these are correct or not lets make an assumption here that there is something fishy going on. If there is something fishy going on, there's nothing the SEC would like more than to neatly sweep it under the rug. Lets say this fishy thing makes it so that closing all short positions in GameStop would cause the stock price to skyrocket due to a share shortage and pose a serious threat to the entire financial system. Obviously this isn't a great outcome if the financial system fails

How does Amazon solve this? An all-stock deal. Short sellers go from being short Gamestop to being short Amazon. The number of liquid shares of Amazon is far greater in dollar value than the liquid shares of Gamestop. This means that short sellers would be able to close out of their position without pushing up Amazon's stock price to some ridiculous number

&#x200B;

**4: Amazon has the cash to bankroll and supercharge Gamestop's innovation**

Between developing NFTs and reinventing their business Gamestop has some challenges ahead of it. To execute on their strategies they will need cash to do so. An Amazon + Gamestop merger is more valuable than Gamestop alone and Amazon alone. Furthermore Amazon could benefit from this Gamestop's NFT technology (think digital rights management solution for all of Amazon's content) and expand its market share in collectables and gaming.

&#x200B;

**5: Amazon could use a distraction from news focusing on thwarted worker unionization attempts**

Being able to shift the news narrative from ""Amazon kills unionization attempts"" to ""Amazon saves \~50,000 jobs at struggling retailer Gamestop"" seems like an obvious perk of doing this deal

&#x200B;

Just a couple recent articles about Amazon:

Frontpage news was made fairly recently as Amazon defeated a unionization attempt

&#x200B;

**6: Jeff Bezos is looking for a new project. Being the biggest champion of GameStop would cement his legacy**

Now that Jeff Bezos is stepping down as CEO of Amazon, he has time to work on new projects. Gamestop sounds like a fun fixer-upper for a billionaire with some extra time on his hands. Furthermore the rivalry between Elon Musk and Bezos has never been greater; their competing space projects (blue origin and spacex) have gone head to head in recent years. Elon has a key advantage that Bezos doesn't though - a die-hard fanbase. Arguably these fans have really powered SpaceX and Tesla's success - as Elon's celebrity status draws in talent and sells product. Bezos, while popular doesn't quite have the same type of energized fans. Buying Gamestop would also buy him an army of WSB apes and close the gap.

Elon & Jeff have been rivals for years:

Plus, now that he is single he has time to play videogames!

&#x200B;

**7: Bootstrapping Amazon's P/E Ratio**

Buying GameStop would make Amazon look cheaper (in terms of P/E ratio). As of 5/28 yahoo finance is showing forward (next 12 months) PE ratios of 54 for Amazon and 37 for Gamestop (price around 220) as of 5/28

Having a P/E ratio of 54 and buying a company with a PE ratio of 37 makes the combined company have a P/E ratio somewhere between the two. Amazon P/E ratio going from 54 to less than 54 makes the stock look like a better deal to investors.",Amazon should consider buying Gamestop due to natural synergies between the two business models.

Disclaimer 

This is my first shot at a DD since joining a year ago. Just as a disclaimer I’m kinda retarded and not an expert at financial advise. I also hold 70 shares so I’m definitely biased. 

What the hell is NNDM? 

Nano Dimension is technology company that specializes in 3D printing computer chips. The are aimed at disrupting the current method of computer chip manufacturing called PCB (Printed Circuit Board). 

Why should you care? 

As technology develops the need for more complex computer chips increases. Normal PCB fabrication is limited in is manufacturing capabilities. Nano Dimensions printers can print in 3D with multiple materials, allowing for better optimization of electronics. This has the ability to disrupt the ~$60 billion dollar PCB market. Also imagine having the capability of 3D printing chips in space without having to be resupplied every time you need electronics equipment. 

Not only does their product have the potential to be revolutionary but they manufacture and supply all the bulk materials for there product. So once a company buys their 3D printers they almost have to buy the consumables from NNDM. 2/3 of their revenue comes from the printer itself while the other 1/3 comes from support/consumables. 

They are buying up smaller nano printing companies and have secured almost all the competitive patents. One article said the next competition is 2-3 years behind NNDM 

What are the downsides? 

NNDM has been underperforming over the last year or so in its transition to mass market vendor. They are also struggling to gain a foothold in the PCB market right now. 

It’s also been a rollercoaster of a stock, I have seen massive gains and subsequent losses all with in a few months of each other. 

Conclusion 

This is not a stock to buy if you’re expecting instant gains with in a week or so. You invest in this company if you like the potential in their technology. I believe the stock right now at $7 a share is a steal because if they can optimize production for mass market I believe their stock could be $30+ in a few years. 

Also the short volume ratio is sitting at 27% which is higher than AMC’s 23%.",Potential of Nano Dimension $NNDM,,

Hey fellow traders. Today, l’ll present to you a very strong bull case on AMC that is not explained by simply putting a rocket emoji (I love this emoji by the way) or because someone else posted a strong YOLO bet on the stock. Here is my analysis based on volume, price action, and a powerful pattern named the flag, high and tight.

&#x200B;

[Weekly chart](https://preview.redd.it/5bruexp383271.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=f679d9584a983071eaf036df2e4c5be14069eaae)

Firstly on the weekly chart, we see a high tight flag that started developing from the low on January 5th at $1.91 (#1) to the high of the pattern which was achieved on January 27th at a staggering price of $20.36 (#2). In 17 trading days, the stock soared 1065.96%. It’s an understatement that this price action caught my attention. The following months saw the stock consolidate in a flag, high and tight on falling volume. Bulkowski studied this pattern extensively and it’s one of his favorites. HTF is characterised by a rise of at least 90% (aim for double) in less than 2 months followed by a consolidation period on ideally falling volume. I think we easily meet these criteria! The performance rank of this pattern in his work is 1 on 23 in a bull market (1 being the best) with an average rise of 69% and throwbacks happening 54% of the time. Price meets target 90% of the time. The measure rule helps us acquire a potential price target for this trade. In his work, Bulkowski tells us to measure the rise and project it 50% past the breakout point. With the measure rule, using the breakout point at $12, we would have a theoretical price target of $63.96 (1065.96/100/2\*12)). Now to the analysis based on volume and price.

On the weekly chart, we have the breakout on #3 with rising and above average volume. This confirms the breakout is not fake, but supported by the professionals. After the minor pullback, we see the momentum exploding and the price action ripping past $20 on very high volume. Like we will see on the daily chart, the last trading day of the week saw some heavy selling which can be seen with the long upper wick on the weekly chart. 

I attribute this to two things. First, the stock rose to overbought levels and a pullback was imminent. Two, the stock hit the ATH of around $35 and many market participants saw this as a good point to take profits.  While it is true the SI rose in this period, I do not believe shorts created this long upper wick. Seems more likely professionals were taking money off the table. This being said, I do not think we are witnessing a trend end since strong momentums like this one cannot be broken in a single day. Like a big cargo ship, it cannot be stopped simply by turning off the engine. More effort will be necessary to break this rocket for sure. On top of that, the most conservative assessment would bring us to $63.96 in less than 30 days (around June 10th) following the breakout and we have a 90% chance of hitting this target according to Bulkowski. If these are not good odds, I don’t know what is. I truly believe this is an opportunity of a lifetime!

&#x200B;

[Daily chart](https://preview.redd.it/wslu122983271.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a1d2f718d41538d8bfad7ffad44ade99c796356)

On the daily chart, we can see the flag, high and tight develop from January 27th on #2 to the breakout at #3 on May 13th. Developing this cause is important according to Wyckoff’s law of cause and effect. The development of a cause will be proportional to the subsequent effect. On May 14th (breakout day (#4)), we see rising and above average volume that confirms the start of a new trend. Then, the test of supply on the pullback at #5, we see falling volume until the stock reaches $12 which means there is no interest in selling at these prices. The rally resumes on very nice long white candles on steadily rising volume which means volume and price are in harmony fully supported by the great professionals. 

On the second to last candle, we see some selling happening as shown with the upper wick. On #6, we see a tall black candle that closes very close to the prior day’s close. I associate this candle with the bearish meeting lines candle. Bulkowski’s work establishes the candle to be a continuation pattern 51% of the time in a bull market, which is pretty much as valid as a coin toss. If the next day’s close is below this candle, Bulkowski tells us there is a 70% chance the candle acts as a reversal. So this is to be looked at closely for next week. The long upper wick and shorter lower wick associated with very high volume tells me there was more selling happening Friday by the professionals. 

We must remember that stocks do not trend in a straight line. Volatility is cyclical, and all this is normal price action. Even in the event that Friday’s price action is stopping volume by the great professionals and the beginning of a distribution phase, Wyckoff’s work tells us this is associated with a potential preliminary supply and this stopping action ALWAYS fails and thus the rally WILL continue. Ladies and gents, I cannot stress enough how AMC is trading currently at a discount and any entry point is a good one at this point in time. We do not choose our seats on a rocket ship! You get in, strap on, and enjoy the ride! Trying to perfectly time the bottom on any pullback is a fool’s errand! Looking back at the daily chart on AMC, #1 (hanging man) and #3 (dark cloud cover) shows us that any bearish candle in the recent history of this stock is likely to be very short lived. Shorting this stock based on the bearish meeting lines (weak bearish candle by the way) would be a very dangerous endeavour indeed.

[30 minutes chart](https://preview.redd.it/erdc846b83271.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ec91557abfecf685c4af681eaf68f0da6a1fd9b)

Lastly, on the 30 minutes chart, friday we see at #1 strong buying pressure as seen with the long lower wick and high volume at $25.50. #2 was a retest on falling volume meaning falling interest to sell at this price. I do believe we have strong support at this level.

No one has a crystal ball and this could go either way, but the odds are that we reach $63.96 by the end of June with a 90% probability according to Bulkowski. I am adding to my position at any dip in this stock. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qbs706tc83271.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=8669186d98ef0792b216b50992969cd1d08fe785

If history is of any guide, I expect AMC to have a short consolidation period with falling volume like we saw with GME before the great run up. Thus, I believe we have another week to add to our positions before this really takes off. Any close above 35$ will be extremely bullish

I’ve been reading many posts explaining the short squeeze potential and this adds to the excitement of a strong bull run in this stock way past $63.96. AMC is currently the most shorted stock in the market as we speak. Though I have doubts that AMC will reach 500k like many claim, I do believe we have a strong squeeze potential in this stock as shown by the candles and volume recently printed on the charts. Ultimately, volume and price will tell us when it is time to close our positions.

Cheers,

20$ 07/16C AMC

30$ 07/16C AMC

Edit: Just to be clear, Bulkowski’s HTF gives us a 90% chance to hit the target in the next 30 days after the breakout. This target is his CONSERVATIVE target not MY target. I do NOT plan to sell at this target. I have no price target at this time since it could squeeze to 10k for all I know. More price action is needed to accurately assess a higher target.",AMC Volume Price Analysis,,

966,2021-05-29 17:51:54,t3_nnsnmx,nnsnmx,wallstreetbets,"TL;DR: Trucking will be the first viable business for autonomous vehicles. TuSimple ($TSP) currently has the best autonomous truck tech and is the closest to commercialization. 

&#x200B;

Why not Robotaxis?

Robotaxis are sexier and thus get all the media attention. But commercialization of robotaxis currently poses several technical, operational, and business challenges. 

&#x200B;

Why not Robotaxis: Technical

Robotaxis are most profitable in downtown environments. But those environments also pose the greatest challenges for an autonomous vehicle due to the large number of hard-to-predict agents. No company has been able to solve those yet. 

&#x200B;

Pick up and drop offs are also technically very challenging because, frankly, most Uber/Lyft pick up and drop offs in downtown environments are in illegal locations. Human drivers can get away with that. But a computer system cannot be programmed to perform illegal actions without the company being held responsible.

&#x200B;

Why not Robotaxis: Operational

With Uber or Lyft, the drivers do much more than just drive. They purchase, store, clean, fuel/charge, and maintain their vehicles. With robotaxis, all of this operational load falls to the robotaxi company. Where are they going to store thousands of vehicles in downtown environments? How are they going to charge them and perform all of the other operational tasks? Even if this problem could be solved, it means that robotaxis will scale much more slowly than Uber or Lyft did.

&#x200B;

Why not Robotaxis: Business

The cost of robotaxis is currently extremely high due to the compute and sensor requirements. Even if they perform perfectly, it will take a long time before they are more profitable than vehicles with human drivers.

&#x200B;

Further, recent regulation in the US has shown that the public support is behind the drivers, not the silicon valley companies. Driving for Uber and Lyft has been a lifeline to people who lost their jobs during the pandemic. So robotaxis are going to be viewed with hostility and likely backlash from the public and thus from governments. 

&#x200B;

Why Trucking?

Why Trucking: Technical

Highway driving, though higher speed, is much more structured than downtown environments. In most ways it is much easier, as evidenced by current level 2 driver assistance systems that easily handle most highway driving. It does, however, require much longer range perception. We will return to that below.

&#x200B;

Why Trucking: Operational

Trucks already have all of the operational infrastructure. They are stored at depots. They have dedicated staff for their cleaning, maintenance, fueling, etc. Making trucks autonomous can simply leverage all of this infrastructure.

&#x200B;

Why Trucking: Business

There is currently a shortage of truck drivers. Freight shippers want to ship faster (and not need to wait for drivers to sleep). Truck driving is not a fun or healthy job. It keeps people away from their families. And trucking is a $4T industry globally ($1T in the US). 

&#x200B;

Given the long lifespan of trucks and their ability to run for millions of miles, the cost of the autonomous compute and sensor system can be amortized much better than for robotaxis.

&#x200B;

In short, the stars are all aligned for autonomous trucks today.

&#x200B;

Why TuSimple? 

The players who started with robotaxis have built their entire tech stack around detailed but short range perception. Trying to convert that tech stack to trucking poses more challenges than one might expect. But since TuSimple has focused on trucking from the beginning (2015), they have built their stack to have 1000 meter perception - more than 4x other companies.

&#x200B;

TuSimple also has been building up partnerships with the rest of the international freight ecosystem since the beginning. They have key partnerships with OEMs, Tier 1s, shipping companies, and part manufacturers in the US, Europe, and Asia. None of the other autonomous companies have that.

&#x200B;

TuSimple is also building their Autonomous Freight Network across the US in multiple phases. Initially, only corridors with favorable weather will be autonomous. But as the technology improves to be able to handle heavy rain and snow, additional corridors can be easily flipped from manual to autonomous mode. 

&#x200B;

But, but, aren’t they Chinese?

They definitely have ties to China. Their first investors were Chinese. So what? 

&#x200B;

This actually gives them an advantage vs pure US players: they have easy access to the entire trucking market in China.

&#x200B;

Conclusion

Given all of the above, TuSimple is undervalued with its current valuation of about $8B. Some other self-driving companies are around $30B or more, despite facing all of the challenges mentioned. 

&#x200B;

In other words: TSP to the moon, apes!

TLDR: SILVER and GOLD MOON by end of june and spy might drill.

&#x200B;

A lot of basel 3 regulations are happening on june 28 2021 and an important one is the Net Stable Funding Rate. 

This regulation in essence requires banks to prove their physical holdings of commodities relative to the amount of physical commodities they have lent out or shorted or leveraged on.

[https://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs271.pdf](https://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs271.pdf)

more details on that link\^

&#x200B;

Many commodities traders say this is the single biggest event in their career and this regulation could send SILVER and GOLD to the moon when:

1. Banks reveal they don't have enough physical holdings -> indicates shortage 
2. Banks can't short physical commodities like gold and silver beyond their physical holdings -> banks cover their shorts causing a squeeze. Banks manipulating the silver market is not a conspiracy theory spread during the gme squeeze to distract wsb retards from gme. The manipulation has been going on for a long time and big banks have been fined heavily for manipulating the silver market ([https://www.reuters.com/article/jp-morgan-spoofing-penalty-idUSKBN26K325](https://www.reuters.com/article/jp-morgan-spoofing-penalty-idUSKBN26K325))

JP Morgan has been a big culprit of manipulating the precious metals market by suppressing the price through paper shorts and when the price falls they buy physical bars of silver.

&#x200B;

Recall that the basel three regulations take place on june 28. Take a look at the OI for $SPY

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[OI for $SPY](https://preview.redd.it/yxbdwumzr3271.jpg?width=652&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ef7a95c937dfdcf0cc136a95c09205a46ddb6c64)

Look at the 06/30 oi. There's an unusually high oi for 06/30 which is a weekly expiry whereas all the other weeklys are nowhere close to the oi on 06/30. There's a 74% oi for put and 25% oi for call on that expiry and similar ratios for the expiries close to june 28 when the basel 3 regulations take effect.

&#x200B;

Now look at the oi for $SLV

&#x200B;

[OI for $SLV](https://preview.redd.it/on521lejs3271.png?width=1232&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fb65ae75d160e8df27682d7a24ddeb82a946d36)

Again look at the 06/30 expiry with the unusally high oi. 1.1 million oi on 06/30 which is INSANELY HIGH for any expiry let alone a weekly. And at this expiry the call oi is 80% and the put oi is 19% which is the opposite of what was observed with SPY. 

Now, normal wsb retards have no idea of basel 3 and the effects on the precious metals market. The high oi and call oi on june 30 on $SLV can't be attributed to wsb retards who hate silver. It's most likely the smart money coming into play. 

Spy has a high put/call ratio while silver has a high call/put ratio on that expiry. Similar values on QQQ and GLD respectively. This points to a scenario where silver moons and spy drills.

Take note that june 28 has a lot of other regulations coming into place as well and there can be other huge moves in the market in other sectors due to the different regulations.

A lot of wsb thought the silver squeeze movement was a conspiracy by the banks but look up the data by yourself if you aren't convinced by this dd.",BASEL 3 is going to send SILVER and GOLD to the MOON,,

Now on to the growth of solar as a sector, specifically on utility production (not residential/personal) because Array’s consumers are only in the utility sector. Array has 12% market share of the solar tracking systems. The growth of the solar utility sector directly influences the growth of Array. Solar been quickly rising over the last decade as cost of solar technology decreased significantly over that time period. Solar energy is now cheaper to produce than coal, natural gas and nuclear as of 2020. Energy production and utility companies will follow the money and continue to build solar plants to capitalize on this opportunity.

Solar accounted for 2.3% of total energy production in 2020. Obviously plenty of room to grow. Coal, Natural gas and Nuclear combined for 80% of total US electricity production in 2020. Now that solar is the cheapest energy source I expect it to take a large portion of that pie, maybe 25% or more in the next 10-15 years would be my guess. The only thing holding solar back is that the power grids in the US are build only to directly transport electricity from the source to its destination. So there is no element of the grid designed to store electricity. This has not been an issue in the past bc coal, nuclear, natural gas and even hydro produce energy 24/7. Obviously Solar can only produce in the day. The solution to this issue is large, utility scale electric storage. The exact kind provided by Tesla. These storage systems will provide necessary liquidity and versatility to the grid with solar production. The Lithium Ion batteries in these storage systems are rapidly decreasing in price. Prices of Li-Ion batteries have dropped 90% in the last decade. As it becomes more appealing for Tesla and other  companies to construct these storage systems and start providing more utility scale electricity storage, more utility companies will invest in solar rigs. It will be more profitable to produce and won’t be held back by the limitations of old grid infrastructure.

   UNDERVALUED:

In the first few months after IPO Array’s price held around the low $40’s, hitting a high of $53.99. In late January until now the stock has sold off significantly. There are 3 main reasons for this and why the concerns are irrelevant in the long term.

1. Broader market tech/growth sell off due to inflation FUD. I’m not going to try to predict if inflation will stay, shoot up, or go back down to relatively normal levels but there is one think I know for sure. Tech/growth is cheaper now. Barring hyperinflation and or a depression, this dip gives long term investors a good buying opportunity. 
2. Tax credit changes hurt YoY revenue. ITC is a federal tax credit that allows people or businesses to right off x% of the cost they spent on solar (and directly related related systems/expenses) on their income tax. This % was 30% up to the end of 2019. Then it is lowered to 26% from 2020-2022, then to 22% in 2023, then 2024+ to 0% for residential and 10% for commercial utility and scale. The fact that there is still a 10% tax creditor the foreseeable future is great. And it doesn’t matter that residential dropped to 0% because Array doesn’t operate in that market. So why would this Tax Credit be bad? Well going back to the top of the post under Quarterly net income I said I would get to later. Q1 2020 was a great Q for array and their revenue. Revenue or that quarter was $438M, compared to the total yearly revenue in 2019 of $650M. Sense that great quarter. Revenue has dropped significantly. And now because YoY of the last Q report is compared to that breakout Q, it makes this Q and YoY growth look really bad. I believe that Q1 2020 revenue was drastically and temporary inflated because of an element of the ITC tax credit. There is a way that constructing solar systems can grab on and hold on to the higher 30% credit from 2019 even if they don’t finish construction before 2020. It is called safe haven. Basically if construction is started and there is a continuous effort made to complete construction and as long as that construction is finished within 4 years, the business will receive the 30% tax credit. In this quarters earnings report, when referring to the 44% decrease in YoY revenue, Array’s CEO said “Results were lower to last year because of the unseasonably high high volume of shipments we had in the first Q 2020 to consumers that were safe harboring tracker systems in connection with the ITC step down” So it seems clear that Array was flooded with orders late 2019 to take advantage of the safe harbor and those revenues showed up on Q1 2020 financials. So even though the YoY revenue from last earnings was bad I believe that the order flow Array is getting was inflated in Q1 2020 and is now deflated because of all the businesses that would be buying trackers now, but bought them earlier because they wanted the better tax credits. I can see this cycle of inflated and deflated order flow/revenue relative to the decreases in ITC tax credits continue until 2024 when the credit stabilizes at 10%. I believe bad YoY data is just a distraction from great long term growth and creates a great buying opportunity.  
3. Supply chain FUD and one time stock based compensation hurt profits. Rapid increase in the price of raw materials, goods and even cost of transporting those goods going up. Supply chain FUD has stacked on top of inflation FUD sense late February until last earnings and has caused a substantial sell off in Array stock. This Supply chain FUD was realized in last quarters earnings (Q1 2021) when profitably/margins sank because cost of goods shot through the roof. “This industry (solar tracking) is contending with increase in steel and shipping costs that are unprecedented in both magnitude and the rate of change.” - Jim Fusaro, Array CEO in Q1 2021 report. YoY the cost of steel has more than doubled Steel represents the almost half of Array’s cost of goods sold so it’s extreme increase in price has an large impact on the bottom line. Shipping costs have also shot up significantly and have the same effect on the bottom line. Even though revenue in Q1 2020 was $438M and revenue Q1 2021 was $246M, operating costs were higher in this Q large due to one time expense that come with becoming a public company. This includes increase in equity based compensation and costs related to common stock. This is simply a short term expense that negatively impacted this Q earnings and will have no further impact on profits/margins. Array is taking action to secure long term contracts with freight providers and fixing commodity prices with suppliers. This action from array combined with the fact that ridiculous prices of shipping and materials will drop in the next year or two as supply meets demand thanks to capitalism. This Supply chain FUD and bad profitability/margin data from last quarter I believe will also have no impact on future growth long term and only creates a good buying opportunity.
