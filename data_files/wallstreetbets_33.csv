Q1 EPS of ($0.48), in-line with the analyst estimate of ($0.48

By end of the year, # of markets will be doubled from last year

For the second quarter of 2021, revenue is expected to be between **$1.025 billion and $1.075 billion,** which represents **41% sequential growth over 1Q21** at the midpoint of the expected range. Adjusted EBITDA1  is expected to be between ($5) million and $5 million, which represents breakeven margin at the midpoint of the expected range

AND, Opendoor has about $**2 billion in cash.** If you follow the industry, you know that M&A is a real winner which will give them to expand even faster to additional markets.

I can't really think of many stocks that are better than Opendoor. Lots of potential here and it's at the price it jumped to on DA. It is more than 50%+ off of its highs and I think it represents a great buying opportunity as of right now.

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 6 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is just about over, so there is a good chance that this is going to be the final spreadsheet until Q2 rolls around. Thank you all for joining me for the ride!

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It’s an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What’s not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they’re one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I’ve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I’d love to see what you guys come up with.

# Conclusion

We’ve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there’s a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season!

302,,2021-05-24 19:42:47,t3_nk6fnw,,wallstreetbets,"Well, the commodity market has been on fire. The question is... is that gonna continue? 
While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and copper for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc) 
I am long on TRQ .",nk6fnw,$TRQ and the Copper/Gold play

It seems to me that this is an important market indicator - if the CEO of a large company sells most of his stock or buys more, this indirectly determines the company's performance and the mood of employees. Of course, insider trading based on non-public information is illegal. However, when the company's employees buy or sell its shares in large quantities, it is completely legal and an important indicator of its affairs.

I’ve been collecting information from Nasdaq and other official sources. Then I aggregated it by months and got two lists as a result - the first is the top 5 companies by insider buying activity and the second is Top 5 by Insider selling activity.

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Their next earnings are slated for 6/10/21 after market close.

 If my calls expire in the money then I'll make about a $300 profit for a total $545 profit in just one month. Then I'll just sell some cash covered puts then rinse and repeat. If the calls expire OTM then it's another monthly covered calls. I truly believe in BNGO which is why I have about 200 other calls on the side for the long term.

The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don’t think it holds up with Zillow. I know their software is great for their agents on the backend, but not into it as a consumer. Overall I like it as a long-term play.

328,,2021-05-25 02:00:02,t3_nkedem,,wallstreetbets,"I want to preface this by saying that I’m primarily a value investor (although many of my clients do own growth stocks) so my area of expertise isn’t necessarily on growth stocks like PENN. With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can’t necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what’s to come. So, let’s take a look at PENN’s growth. 

In 2015 Penn’s revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN’s revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN’s debt to asset ratio of 80% isn’t terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN’s partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,The PLUG Restatement: A Great Chance to Get Out

Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.  There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".  The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.  Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.  In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.  In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.    


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.  While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?  Good question.  I don't know yet.  Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.  Another good question.  I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?  The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.  They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.  This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.  *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**    


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.  And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?  I don't know, but here's a scary graph.  So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.  Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.  Not significantly.  After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.  So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.  Doesn't seem like much.  But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.  I went down another rabbit hole.  1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?  The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.  Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.  Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).  It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.  After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.  And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.  When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?  A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.  But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.  

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.  Short the S&P there.  


Or you could just go to the source, nevermind, retail traders can't get any accurate, up to date, actionable market data.  You can go to the fed, but it's 3 days late.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

**This week's things to watch for:**

  
Tomorrow we also get the results from the Richmond manufacturing index and Consumer confidence.  

Last week, the Empire Index was up (barely) though the prices paid were higher (higher inflation).  The Philly index was down, and prices paid were at 40 year highs.  Tomorrow is Richmond.  Where the fuck is Richmond?  Thursday is unemployment claims, and Friday is another print of CPI.  But it's on a holiday weekend.  So responses should be muted.  If bad, look for a bloody Tuesday.  If good, fuck it, why not?  All time highs again.

In short, no.

SelfWealth members have been allowed to buy and sell GME as  well as others like AMC, throughout the entirety of 2021. This is in  stark comparison to other platforms that entirely halted the trading of  certain stocks.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

my god..

and also they retain the voting rights?! i want out but i dont know who else allows buying of gme and amc... i had a stake account but they stopped letting people buy shares back in January and that's when i got into selfwealth and have been ever since but finding this out today is quiet frightening..

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME –  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.  These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",nkk4c1,where to buy GME stocks in Australia?! SelfWealth is evil and stake was dodgy!

you can legally yolo all your money into a horrible option, and you can become a homeless person or billionaire at any given time. What is the difference between these 2 groups, well to me it is structure.

&#x200B;

You may be saying, 'well I have my trading system so I am good right?', no - you are not. You are missing 50% of the equation. Hear me out:

&#x200B;

A trading STRUCTURE is what should house, or literally be the roof and foundation for your SYSTEM. Imagine a trading system being a furnace, it cannot keep you warm and safe without a roof, walls, and foundation. So, what is my structure and system; here ya go:

&#x200B;

Trading Structure (Literal Home):

**Foundation**: Risk Management - All decisions, all other elements, and all trades are GROUNDED in risk management. I get it, 'Apes Stick Together' or whatever, but I use stop losses - I enter every trade with a set loss and take profit. I do not get emotional, I have a plan, and each trade is a 3 reward to 1 risk setup at least for a small move.

**Walls**: I base my 4 balls of success on:

1. 3 Analysis: 
   1. **Fundamental Analysis** based on news, P/E Ratio, Floats, EPS, etc. 
   2. **Technical Analysis** based on charts, graphs, value. If you are one of those 'AsTrOlOgY fOr IdIoTs' people, fine but understand you are handicapping yourself due to your own ego.
   3. **Mental Analysis** based on confidence, execution, and planning.
2. **Macro Economic** moves like inflation rates, money supply, consumer confidence; and Indexes like S&P, Nasdaq, DOW30, Russell2000, etc. I also study the 11 sectors intently too.
3. **Trading Plan** that includes a stop loss, a loading or buying zone, a price target, and an exit strategy and entry strategy already planned.
4. **Goal Setting** for my 1 month, 6 month, 1 year, 5 year, etc.... and what each trade does to help these goals.

From there my '**ROOF**' or my added protection is consistency. I stick to these rules. Before every trade, I double check with my 'roof' that I am being consistent. When I am in a trade, I check to make sure I am being consistent. When I exit - guess what, I check I am being consistent.

That means the EXPI could easily move up 6 times what it is trading at now.

EXPI also just increased their share buyback program from 75m to 475m. Which means they could buy a ton of stock and are probably going to announce a share buyback. Sending the already 54% insider owned stock absolutely skyrocketing due to them not selling the stock and supply running short.

Thus, the banks would no longer operate illegal and unlawful financing should they offer loans and other services to the companies. That would be a huge step in removing what analysts are calling an obstacle to the development of a national cannabis industry.

Legislators voted for the bill with 321-101 votes and sent it to the Senate.

https://preview.redd.it/5mpqdo4tja171.jpg?width=660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1255ec4f5a2471772ca27ad86ea25c16167d241b

The bill clarifies that proceeds from legal cannabis deals are not considered illegal and instructs federal regulators to create rules on how they would oversee such banking activities. Banks have so far been unwilling to do business with companies that sell marijuana or related products, fearing they could run into conflict with US federal law. This has left marijuana companies with few options to rely on a handful of small financial institutions or do cash deals. The American Bankers Association has aggressively lobbied for the SAFE Banking Act bill.

The banks have been in a difficult position due to the conflict between state and federal law, so it makes sense that Congress must act now to resolve this conflict. Thirty-six US states have now legalized medical cannabis, while 17 states already allow recreational use of cannabis by adults.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would try to push legislation. The positive reaction of the stock prices of Tilray, Sundial Growers, Aphria or Aurora Cannabis shows the great relief of investors. Investors hope that this could have kicked off further progressive reforms in the cannabis sector. This move took the potential of a game-changing marijuana law an important step forward.

If Congress passes the SAFE Banking Act and President Joe Biden signs it, it would likely become much easier and cheaper for marijuana companies to raise the capital they need to fund their growth initiatives. The law should also make cannabis companies safer and more efficient, as credit services would reduce the need for cash in day-to-day operations.

Tilray's merger with Aphria paved the way for creating the world's largest cannabis company (by revenue). After checking out a lot about TLRY i was buying 1.170 Tilray-stocks today.

Or is there other materials that can be used? I know we will still be using wood for most construction. At this time, lumber it is still the most cost efficient but who is to say someone doesn't discover a more cost efficient way.

Currently the stock is down 15-20% from the opening bell. Who cares? Nobody is fever-buying IPOs like they were late last year or early this year. But this is actually the perfect time to buy in. Why? Well this IPO is actually occurring exactly when YouTube is just about to fuck over all of the business YouTube accounts in the USA.

What is YouTube doing to fuck over businesses? Well they are starting to run ads on non-partnered content. See source here, from the November terms of use update: [https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719)

If you don't want to read this, basically it says that channels that aren't partners are now going to get ads on their videos and YouTube is keeping ALL of the revenue (fuck you, right?). I've personally already witnessed this because I manage YT channels for several businesses and I've already gotten ads. And guess who gets a call every time their client sees an ad on their videos? Me, I get the call. 

&#x200B;

**When does this happen?**

It's already started. I've started seeing ads on corporate non-monetized and uncopyrighted videos within the last couple weeks, but the change is supposed to be implemented across the country in June. I've already been getting calls from my boss and from clients. We are already moving a lot of content to Vimeo.

&#x200B;

**Why does this matter?** 

Businesses are not going to be happy if their competitors are running ads on their videos. Especially if that ad occurs when the video is embedded on their own website. I know for a fact that ads are showing in YouTube but there has been no distinction that I'm aware of that would prohibit them from running ads in embedded videos on a website or blog. 

&#x200B;

**What is going to happen?**

If businesses start seeing competitor ads on their videos, they will do everything they can to stop it. They can either join the YPP and disable ads or they can leave the platform. However, there are requirements to the YPP:

1. They must have 1,000 subscribers
2. They must have 4,000 watch hours in the last 12 months

I can promise you that most businesses do not even come close to meeting these requirements. They can try to purchase subscribers or views but YouTube is good at identifying this. Trust me, I've gone down that road and have seen channels get taken down because of it.

&#x200B;

**Why is VMEO the best play here?**

The main reason is because businesses will leave YouTube.

Vimeo is hand-down my favorite video hosting service for a few reasons:

* The video encode quality is visibly better
* The embedded player is 100% customizable
* It's easier to pick thumbnails
* It has a built-in review system for businesses
* And the best feature, you can update videos without changing the URL (very helpful for embedding)

What's the drawback? It costs $7/month for most of these features. But businesses will gladly pay that to not have their competitors on their website/videos.

This is not a financial Advise,

RBLX has been on a bull run for past week and more. I wanted to to highlight few critical points here.

RBLX is approaching its resistance, Bearish in short term.  
It might fight $90 for 1 or 2 days, and then retrace to 21 ema (must be close to the ascending support line around $72) Wise decision would be to close a position now and re-enter at a lower price.  
Another data point to be cautions, analysts 12 month high price target - $90.

Trade cautiously, do your own DD.

If one completely ignored the **immediate** circumstances, I'd have to agree; the only thing currently suggesting investing is the future prospect that Ryan Cohen can pull off a turn around. (Which, to my mind, has a significant probability of success.)

But, you can't invest in isolation.  GME is heavily manipulated.  We know this.  ""Shorts have covered!""  We know the have not; merely shifted direct shorting into indirect means (ETFs/Options.)

What I think everyone who isn't a ""believer"" (no offense) misses is that we absolutely DO NOT believe in what you call ""a continued upward trend throughout the year.""  (Well, maybe some do, I don't.)  We believe in a ""blast off"" and reset to fundamentals.

We will sell for exorbitant amounts and by back in at sound levels (I'm thinking $38.50-45.00). Hell, my holdings literally just went completely positive (four separate lots) for the first time since early-March as I'm writing this.",,

All the Apollo craft carried liquid oxygen in the Command and Service Module, used for both breathing and to power their electrical fuel cells. Now, zero-g does some weird stuff to fluid dynamics, and the pressure sensors in the tanks weren't always accurate as a result. To combat this, an internal mechanism was able to ""stir"" the O2 inside the tank, homogenizing/mixing it and allowing the pressure sensors to get a more accurate reading. The Apollo 13 crew performed a routine tank stir en route to the moon, but the CSM *Odyssey* had a fault in its wiring; some of the insulation on the wires that controlled the stirring mechanism had come off, leading to a short, leading to a spark, which reacted rather violently with the highly-pressurized pure O2 in the tanks. The explosion blew off essentially the entire panel on that side of the ship and ruptured both O2 tanks, causing the ship's atmosphere and electrical supply to be vented into space, along with causing extensive damage to numerous other systems onboard (their main antenna was utterly fucked, for instance). Luckily, the explosion hadn't ruptured the ship's hull, or they would have been dead right there. Knowing that they would need the command module for re-entry, the crew shut down the whole CSM to conserve power and moved to the Lunar Module *Aquarius*, using it as a lifeboat. The apes back at NASA had actually prepared contingency plans for this, even though the scenario had been considered ""extremely unlikely"", so they weren't going into things completely unprepared. It was uncomfortable - very, very uncomfortable - but the crew had enough food and oxygen to get them back to Earth. Water was a bit trickier; they had to ration roughly 200 mL (a bit under a cup, for any Americans reading this) per person per day, as most of their drinkable supply was produced as a byproduct from the CSM's fuel cells, which were now nonfunctional. 200 mL a day certainly isn't fun or pleasant, but it was doable. They could survive on it long enough to make it home. The next problem was carbon dioxide. 

The CO2 our bodies exhale isn't breathable, and in fact becomes toxic in high enough concentrations. This isn't a problem on Earth, both because we have an entire planets' worth of atmosphere to work with and because plants eat CO2 and shit oxygen (paraphrasing, of course). In an airtight, closed-loop environment like a spacecraft, however, it can build up to toxic levels within a matter of hours, and we thus use ""CO2 scrubbers"", small machines that use a chemical reaction to remove CO2 from the air and sequester it as a solid. *Aquarius* only had enough CO2 scrubbers to handle two people for ~45 hours, not 3 people for the 4-ish days it would take to return to Earth. It should also be noted that although the chemical reaction is ""free"" in terms of electricity, the scrubbers have to be properly fitted into their slots and have a fan running to pull atmosphere though, which takes a moderate amount of power. Just waving a spare canister around in the air wouldn't do anything, for instance. They still had a huge stock of fresh scrubber canisters left over in the *Odyssey* that hadn't been used, but with the *Odyssey* shut down, they couldn't use any of its systems. The obvious solution, then, was to use *Odyssey's* scrubber cartridges in *Aquarius'* systems, but - and I shit you not - the *Aquarus'* scrubbers accepted round cartridges, while the *Odyssey's* were square. The crew had to, quite literally, fit a square peg into a round hole. Yeah, the movie didn't make that up. Anyways, NASA put their enormously wrinkled brains to work and devised a contraption called ""the mailbox"". Using only what they had on board, the crew managed to create a device that allowed them to bridge the gap between the two systems, letting them hook up the CSM's scrubber cartridges to the Lunar Module's systems. It worked - CO2 levels in the cabin started dropping pretty much as soon as they hooked it up, and it held for the entire trip home. 

As an aside, something else interesting is that all the Apollo missions burned for the moon following something called a ""free-return trajectory"". This is essentially a carefully-balanced path that allows you to, if you don't fire your engine at all again after the initial burn, slingshot and loop back around the moon in a figure-eight motion to return to Earth, re-entering the atmosphere without any additional course corrections or adjustments, hence a ""free return"". This was considered a safe option, because if the CSM's engine failed to light for any course correction or lunar injection burns, the crew would still return to Earth safely as they followed the previous trajectory - you could say that NASA intentionally ""missed"" the moon with the initial trajectories of the Apollo craft. However, before the accident, *Odyssey* had performed her first midcourse correction burn, placing the craft into what was called a ""hybrid trajectory"". The ship would still miss the moon, but would also miss Earth on the return journey if no actions were taken. Had all gone well, this would have allowed the mission to land at their high-latitude target in the Fra Mauro highlands (a free-return trajectory would have limited landing spots to near-equatorial sites). All did not, of course, go well, and now the crew had to somehow make a correction burn if they wanted to actually come home instead of just waving out the window as they coasted by. 

Using the CSM *Odyssey's* engine was deemed fairly out of the question. In addition to lacking the power they'd need to reboot the CSM, run the guidance computers, run the engine, and shut everything back down again, they didn't have any information on its status, and were (rightly) concerned that the O2 tank explosion might have damaged it, in which case it could have just blown up the entire ship upon ignition. It was decided instead that they would perform several course correction burns using *Aquarius'* engine. The margins were slim, and they were operating far outside the Lunar Module's rated capabilities, but it ought to have been just capable of making the required course corrections. This required several NASA programmers on the ground to work around the clock, frantically figuring out how to program the *Aquarius'* flight computer for the task, as firing the lunar module's engine with the CSM still attached (let alone in an attempt to change the course of the spacecraft) had never been even remotely considered as a contingency. Mission Commander Jim Lovell also had to manually record values from *Odyssey's* flight computer before shutting down the CSM, re-calculating the values by hand according to the programmers' instructions on the ground before manually entering them into *Aquarius'* flight computer before each burn. Long story short, the burns were successful. They were more or less the most exciting part of the coast home; the rest of the crew's time reportedly consisted mostly of maintaining the spacecraft, conserving their energy, and otherwise trying to rest. By all accounts, it was absolutely miserable: everybody was exhausted, hungry, thirsty, freezing (with no power to continuously run the heater, temperatures dropped to as low as 3 Celsius within the cabin), and bored. Fred Haise, the Lunar Module pilot, also developed a UTI due to low fluid intake and microgravity's effects on the immune system. Eventually, though, they were nearing Earth, their trajectory was lined up, and it was time to enter the final phase of the flight.

The crew had to power up the CSM cold, from scratch, in-flight, a scenario that, once again, had never been even briefly thought about at NASA, as it had been thought so unlikely as to be impossible. Additionally, they had to do this without overstressing the cold batteries. If they drew too much current and killed them, the crew were all dead, as simple as that. Once again, NASA's remarkably wrinkled brains rose to the occasion, devising a procedure on the ground that the crew followed in-flight to power up the CSM once more. They cut the Command Module loose from the Service Module and *Aquarius*, photographing the side of the service module in the process. Reviewing the photos, it seems like an utter miracle that the crew weren't killed outright when the O2 tanks exploded - the entire side of the ship was torn open, and there was clear damage to *Odyssey's* engine, validating the decision to use *Aquarius* for their course correction burns. The crew prepared for re-entry. The heatshield had been below its rated temperature for days - it might have cracked or been damaged during the trip back. The crew was well aware of this, but there was no way for them to inspect it or to have done anything about it had it been damaged. Additionally, the craft was re-entering at a higher speed than it was designed for (Apollo 13 still holds the absolute world altitude record, obtained when they crossed the far side of the moon as it was at the farthest point in its orbit), far faster than any previous Apollo mission. There was a very real chance that the craft could have burned up like a shooting star, killing the crew instantly. Re-entering, the craft entered its expected plasma blackout, the sheath of particles shrouding the module preventing any communication with the crew. The ground crew clenched their teeth. The expected four-minute blackout period came and went, and still, there was no contact with the crew. Five minutes. Six. The ground crew was beginning to fear the worst. Suddenly, the radio crackled to life: *Odyssey* had made it, and was on track for a safe splashdown in the Indian Ocean. The efforts of thousands of NASA apes on the ground had been successful; the crew of Apollo 13 had been returned safely home.",,

2224,gzf9nms,2021-05-25 18:55:19,t1_gzf9nms,t1_gzeskb2,wallstreetbets,"I thought about housing versus crypto versus precious metals.

Housing has utility (you can use it) but no portability.  It is finite because of land area. Also demand outpaces supply because all the good spots are already filled with housing.  Housing is also a good proposition for skyrocketing inflation. If you have a mortgage, you can easily pay it off if inflation is soaring.  The problem with housing is that it can be fucked with by governments.  They can tax it into oblivion.  They know who owns it and can fuck with the owner.  They can pass laws protecting tenants and preventing evictions while the owner has no cash flow and can’t pay his mortgage and gets foreclosed on by his bank.  There is just all this fuckery that the government can pull on housing.

Precious metals have more portability and some utility (industrial applications)  They are not as finite as housing sense there is ongoing extraction.  But the ongoing mining is more and more expensive because all the good mines are mined so we’re left with having to mine in deeper and more dangerous mines.  Also, precious metals are not easily moved across borders.  Governments will also fuck with precious metals in times of crisis.  They may pass laws to fuck with ownership of precious metals.  Like asking owners to sell to the state. Or taxing ownership.  If it exists in the real world and is tangible/real, I expect that desperate governments will fuck with it.

Crypto/bitcoin is finite and the most portable.  It’s also borderless/international.  I don’t think one nations military or sovereign power would be able to stop or outlaw crypto.  It’s decentralized so there’s just no way to zap it out of existence.  It cannot be taxed, it can move across borders freely.  It also cannot be tracked by governments.  Ownership is anonymous.  I like it because desperate governments can’t fuck with it.",,

We've been in the same channel for 100yrs...just broke out to the top...the correction won't come until the Fed stops buying 
$120bn of bonds per month.  If the USA wants to hold onto reserve status, we can't devalue that USD forever.  So interest rates going to climb, valuations will go down.   How fast, how far, when that happens?   Henry Dean doesn't know.   Michael Burry doesn't know.

Every country on earth is devaluing during Covid...it's the only way the Fed gets away with it.  Eventually an economic winner of the Covid crisis emerges ..if it's China our pain will be the interest rate climb to stay relevent, and then the pain his the greater economy.  That doesn't start until the fed stops brrr...  

The setup we have today is the same as 1927-1929...if it plays out the same (which it probably won't) it could mean the same 90% off stock valuations and a 10yr depression to follow.  I believe history echoes, I don't believe anything was fixed from the 2008 crash, so yes I feel it will happen again.  Stock up  now...the party isn't over until the fed stop brr...don't play risky shit you can't lose, but don't miss out on the gains.  Then again this is WSB...fuck it YOLO apes!",,

GameStop completed their multi-million share sell off to raise capital without it affecting the price much at all, and without anyone really knowing that it was happening. So, at this point, it can take off at any time, and when that happens and share recalls start going out, the price should really boom.

>I want to call attention to the fact that GME has been consolidating for 2 months and looks just about ready to launch. Check the chart below, courtesy of traderstewie. For months GME has been tightening and building higher lows on the daily and weekly. The key level to break out of the wedge is \~190 which we're pretty much exactly at now. Above $190 the path looks open to $300+.

I was a paper handed bitch the first 2 run ups and sold at decent times and made a 9X the first time and a 2.5 X the second time along w a selling a few CSPs successfully along the way. Last week when it shot up  a little, I posted I bought 11 shares as a show of support for my brothers and sisters and didn’t care if it moonshot or crashed to $40 because the stonk and community has given much to me. I did put a limit order for 4 more shares rn at $201 in case it gets pushed down.

1) Girls do not pee out of the vagina, you are not putting your mouth on her pee hole.

2) The texture is closer to the texture of the inside of your cheek, it’s really not gross, and if it’s with the right person it’s honestly a lot of fun

3) Hair in the mouth isn’t really as big of a deal as you might thing, but also yeah that can happen.

It’s not unhygienic, but if you ever feel that someone you’re having sex with is not clean, for whatever reason, there are plenty of ways to take care of that. You can always just suggest that you two take a shower with each other as foreplay, and that avoids any hurt feelings. Or you can just say no. You never have to do anything you’re not comfortable doing.

Stay with me apes. 

We can’t do this unless it’s all of us, together.

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 6 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is just about over, so there is a good chance that this is going to be the final spreadsheet until Q2 rolls around. Thank you all for joining me for the ride!

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It’s an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What’s not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they’re one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I’ve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I’d love to see what you guys come up with.

# Conclusion

We’ve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there’s a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles!

3903,,2021-05-24 19:42:47,t3_nk6fnw,,wallstreetbets,"Well, the commodity market has been on fire. The question is... is that gonna continue? 
While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and copper for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc) 
I am long on TRQ .",nk6fnw,$TRQ and the Copper/Gold play

It seems to me that this is an important market indicator - if the CEO of a large company sells most of his stock or buys more, this indirectly determines the company's performance and the mood of employees. Of course, insider trading based on non-public information is illegal. However, when the company's employees buy or sell its shares in large quantities, it is completely legal and an important indicator of its affairs.

I’ve been collecting information from Nasdaq and other official sources. Then I aggregated it by months and got two lists as a result - the first is the top 5 companies by insider buying activity and the second is Top 5 by Insider selling activity.

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Their next earnings are slated for 6/10/21 after market close.

Last week I sold calls for the first time and I decided to go all in. I had about $2,780 invested in QYLD which gave me about $343 a year and $28.6 a month. I decided to retire this investment and use it to buy 500 shares of BNGO at about $5.54. I then sold 5 $6 June 18, covered calls for $245 premium which will cover my monthly hooker expense, for legal reasons that's a joke. Already I earned 70% of what QYLD would have payed me in a year.

 If my calls expire in the money then I'll make about a $300 profit for a total $545 profit in just one month. Then I'll just sell some cash covered puts then rinse and repeat. If the calls expire OTM then it's another monthly covered calls. I truly believe in BNGO which is why I have about 200 other calls on the side for the long term.

The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don’t think it holds up with Zillow. I know their software is great for their agents on the backend, but not into it as a consumer. Overall I like it as a long-term play.

3929,,2021-05-25 02:00:02,t3_nkedem,,wallstreetbets,"I want to preface this by saying that I’m primarily a value investor (although many of my clients do own growth stocks) so my area of expertise isn’t necessarily on growth stocks like PENN. With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can’t necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what’s to come. So, let’s take a look at PENN’s growth. 

In 2015 Penn’s revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN’s revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN’s debt to asset ratio of 80% isn’t terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN’s partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,The PLUG Restatement: A Great Chance to Get Out

Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.  There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".  The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.  Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.  In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.  In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.    


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.  While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?  Good question.  I don't know yet.  Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.  Another good question.  I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?  The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.  They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.  This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.  *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**    


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.  And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?  I don't know, but here's a scary graph.  So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.  Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.  Not significantly.  After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.  So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.  Doesn't seem like much.  But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.  I went down another rabbit hole.  1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?  The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.  Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.  Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).  It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.  After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.  And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.  When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?  A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.  But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.  

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.  Short the S&P there.  


Or you could just go to the source, nevermind, retail traders can't get any accurate, up to date, actionable market data.  You can go to the fed, but it's 3 days late.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

**This week's things to watch for:**

  
Tomorrow we also get the results from the Richmond manufacturing index and Consumer confidence.  

Last week, the Empire Index was up (barely) though the prices paid were higher (higher inflation).  The Philly index was down, and prices paid were at 40 year highs.  Tomorrow is Richmond.  Where the fuck is Richmond?  Thursday is unemployment claims, and Friday is another print of CPI.  But it's on a holiday weekend.  So responses should be muted.  If bad, look for a bloody Tuesday.  If good, fuck it, why not?  All time highs again.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME –  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.  These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",nkk4c1,where to buy GME stocks in Australia?! SelfWealth is evil and stake was dodgy!

you can legally yolo all your money into a horrible option, and you can become a homeless person or billionaire at any given time. What is the difference between these 2 groups, well to me it is structure.

&#x200B;

You may be saying, 'well I have my trading system so I am good right?', no - you are not. You are missing 50% of the equation. Hear me out:

&#x200B;

A trading STRUCTURE is what should house, or literally be the roof and foundation for your SYSTEM. Imagine a trading system being a furnace, it cannot keep you warm and safe without a roof, walls, and foundation. So, what is my structure and system; here ya go:

&#x200B;

Trading Structure (Literal Home):

**Foundation**: Risk Management - All decisions, all other elements, and all trades are GROUNDED in risk management. I get it, 'Apes Stick Together' or whatever, but I use stop losses - I enter every trade with a set loss and take profit. I do not get emotional, I have a plan, and each trade is a 3 reward to 1 risk setup at least for a small move.

**Walls**: I base my 4 balls of success on:

1. 3 Analysis: 
   1. **Fundamental Analysis** based on news, P/E Ratio, Floats, EPS, etc. 
   2. **Technical Analysis** based on charts, graphs, value. If you are one of those 'AsTrOlOgY fOr IdIoTs' people, fine but understand you are handicapping yourself due to your own ego.
   3. **Mental Analysis** based on confidence, execution, and planning.
2. **Macro Economic** moves like inflation rates, money supply, consumer confidence; and Indexes like S&P, Nasdaq, DOW30, Russell2000, etc. I also study the 11 sectors intently too.
3. **Trading Plan** that includes a stop loss, a loading or buying zone, a price target, and an exit strategy and entry strategy already planned.
4. **Goal Setting** for my 1 month, 6 month, 1 year, 5 year, etc.... and what each trade does to help these goals.

From there my '**ROOF**' or my added protection is consistency. I stick to these rules. Before every trade, I double check with my 'roof' that I am being consistent. When I am in a trade, I check to make sure I am being consistent. When I exit - guess what, I check I am being consistent.

There will be some nights we would all enjoy and actually benefit from not having a roof. Those 73 degree, sunny days come - and we may enjoy sleeping in a tent or even sleeping with the sound of toad ribbits and cricket songs, and we give that up. We do because there are also hurricane level monsoons and without a roof, your whole room will be ruined (blowing up your account).

&#x200B;

From there, you place your SYSTEM in this STRUCTURE. Scalping, great. Day trader, beautiful. Swing, long term, only ETF, dividends!? That is fine. Anytime frame, any short term goal, and account size; all of the things that make your TRADING EDGE or SYSTEM goes into the STRUCUTRE.

&#x200B;

Please have both. Please have rules. Please understand you are in a chaotic neutral system, with 0 rules, 0 guidance, 0 anything. You either create your own structure, or have none. You fail to plan, than you're planning to fail. Good luck.",nkq9et,The Difference Between A Trading Structure And A Trading System

I want to call attention to the fact that GME has been consolidating for 2 months and looks just about ready to launch. Check the chart below courtesy of traderstewie. For months GME has been tightening and building higher lows on the daily and weekly. The key level to break out of the wedge is \~190 which we're pretty much exactly at now. Above $190 the path looks open to $300+.

**What I'm saying my friends is that GME is starting to look like a rocket launch site.**

The only thing missing is VOLUME. SPCE & TSLA look interesting but what we're seeing in GME is 5-star. Think maybe it's time we get the band back together.

Not advice, I just like the stock. Do you?

*As always, do your own due diligence. Knowing how to read charts can make you slightly more likely to catch break outs and mitigate losses but there is always uncertainty. Don't speculate with $ you can't afford to lose.*

Thus, the banks would no longer operate illegal and unlawful financing should they offer loans and other services to the companies. That would be a huge step in removing what analysts are calling an obstacle to the development of a national cannabis industry.

Legislators voted for the bill with 321-101 votes and sent it to the Senate.

https://preview.redd.it/5mpqdo4tja171.jpg?width=660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1255ec4f5a2471772ca27ad86ea25c16167d241b

The bill clarifies that proceeds from legal cannabis deals are not considered illegal and instructs federal regulators to create rules on how they would oversee such banking activities. Banks have so far been unwilling to do business with companies that sell marijuana or related products, fearing they could run into conflict with US federal law. This has left marijuana companies with few options to rely on a handful of small financial institutions or do cash deals. The American Bankers Association has aggressively lobbied for the SAFE Banking Act bill.

The banks have been in a difficult position due to the conflict between state and federal law, so it makes sense that Congress must act now to resolve this conflict. Thirty-six US states have now legalized medical cannabis, while 17 states already allow recreational use of cannabis by adults.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would try to push legislation. The positive reaction of the stock prices of Tilray, Sundial Growers, Aphria or Aurora Cannabis shows the great relief of investors. Investors hope that this could have kicked off further progressive reforms in the cannabis sector. This move took the potential of a game-changing marijuana law an important step forward.

If Congress passes the SAFE Banking Act and President Joe Biden signs it, it would likely become much easier and cheaper for marijuana companies to raise the capital they need to fund their growth initiatives. The law should also make cannabis companies safer and more efficient, as credit services would reduce the need for cash in day-to-day operations.

Currently the stock is down 15-20% from the opening bell. Who cares? Nobody is fever-buying IPOs like they were late last year or early this year. But this is actually the perfect time to buy in. Why? Well this IPO is actually occurring exactly when YouTube is just about to fuck over all of the business YouTube accounts in the USA.

What is YouTube doing to fuck over businesses? Well they are starting to run ads on non-partnered content. See source here, from the November terms of use update: [https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719)

If you don't want to read this, basically it says that channels that aren't partners are now going to get ads on their videos and YouTube is keeping ALL of the revenue (fuck you, right?). I've personally already witnessed this because I manage YT channels for several businesses and I've already gotten ads. And guess who gets a call every time their client sees an ad on their videos? Me, I get the call. 

&#x200B;

**When does this happen?**

It's already started. I've started seeing ads on corporate non-monetized and uncopyrighted videos within the last couple weeks, but the change is supposed to be implemented across the country in June. I've already been getting calls from my boss and from clients. We are already moving a lot of content to Vimeo.

&#x200B;

**Why does this matter?** 

Businesses are not going to be happy if their competitors are running ads on their videos. Especially if that ad occurs when the video is embedded on their own website. I know for a fact that ads are showing in YouTube but there has been no distinction that I'm aware of that would prohibit them from running ads in embedded videos on a website or blog. 

&#x200B;

**What is going to happen?**

If businesses start seeing competitor ads on their videos, they will do everything they can to stop it. They can either join the YPP and disable ads or they can leave the platform. However, there are requirements to the YPP:

1. They must have 1,000 subscribers
2. They must have 4,000 watch hours in the last 12 months

I can promise you that most businesses do not even come close to meeting these requirements. They can try to purchase subscribers or views but YouTube is good at identifying this. Trust me, I've gone down that road and have seen channels get taken down because of it.

&#x200B;

**Why is VMEO the best play here?**

The main reason is because businesses will leave YouTube.

Vimeo is hand-down my favorite video hosting service for a few reasons:

* The video encode quality is visibly better
* The embedded player is 100% customizable
* It's easier to pick thumbnails
* It has a built-in review system for businesses
* And the best feature, you can update videos without changing the URL (very helpful for embedding)

What's the drawback? It costs $7/month for most of these features. But businesses will gladly pay that to not have their competitors on their website/videos.

This is not a financial Advise,

RBLX has been on a bull run for past week and more. I wanted to to highlight few critical points here.

RBLX is approaching its resistance, Bearish in short term.  
It might fight $90 for 1 or 2 days, and then retrace to 21 ema (must be close to the ascending support line around $72) Wise decision would be to close a position now and re-enter at a lower price.  
Another data point to be cautions, analysts 12 month high price target - $90.

Giant short squeeze. “He who sells what isn’t his’n, must pay up or go to prison.”  Brokerage firms have also gone bust over this.  It can even be done legally with tiny micro-caps.  I did it in the 1960’s with Red Lake Labs.  Bought the float at $40, the broker naked shorted to sell to me, couldn’t borrow the stock to cover, and I sold it back to him the next day at $60.

Crypto is pretty much useless in this scenario.  If there is political unrest, and you tried to start using crypto as a currency, what makes you think people wouldn't just steal it from you (assuming it had any value)

How would you use crypto is the internet was down?

The problem is a lot of the old school guys who were privileged enough to get this information are all dying out slowly. The way it works now is so over compartmentalized that no one really knows the full truth anymore, not like the old timers did.

Since we're just speculating here, I'd put my money into Northrup Grumman before anything else since they're pretty much the ones that got all that tech from the Roswell crash.  Philip Corso who was under Lt. Gen. Arthur Trudeau spoke about how the tech recovered paved the way for particle beams, fiber optics, lasers, integrated circuit, microprocessors, night vision and kevlar. 

There are only a handful of agencies/defense contractors that are involved in that stuff. Supposedly nothing even remotely interesting happens out at Area 51 anymore, all the good stuff was relocated out to Los Alamos and some other D.U.M.B's away from the eyes of everyone else. 

The government still believes that people aren't mentally capable of handling the truth that we're not alone in an infinitely vast universe. They think we're going to go into a panic like it's some Orwell radio show and we just can't process it. Little do they know a higher percentage of people believe other worlds exists aside from our own and with that comes other life. The government just can't undo all the lies they've spun because it requires coming outright and saying ""Hey, we lied about this."" They won't do that.",,

As excited as I was for a Tesla truck before the cybertruck was unveiled, I was immediately disappointed when I saw what it looked like. The shape alone makes it highly impractical for most things I use a pickup for outside of daily driving. I haul a cabover camper on road trips for vacation. The shape of the cybertruck alone makes it impossible to ever haul a camper. Not that I would be hauling mine with any electric truck anyway, but there are ultra lightweight campers out there that could probably be hauled with an electric pickup, and are probably well within what an F150 Lightning can do based on what I've seen of it so far. I'm guessing most people buying the cybertruck are not going to be doing truck type things with it.",,

Read up on the history of this burgeoning company, the wealthy patent trove they hold, and the current technology verticals that are up for sale. For example: Augmented Reality, Lidar, Laser Beam Scanning, etc. 
This company currently- emphasis on currently-has the technology to change the future and will do just that in good time. 
Tomorrow is the MVIS annual shareholders meeting, just after Ford’s big Capital Markets Day. 
MVIS is looking for strategic partners to buy certain verticals or even open to a buyout by a large tech company like Nvidia, Google, Microsoft etc. 
As far as PPS goes it’s a battleground. But whether you take a strategic short position or a long position IMO - it will be a win.

6466,gzfj2ac,2021-05-25 20:01:21,t1_gzfj2ac,t3_nkyn0w,wallstreetbets,"TIL: The IRS & Fed continue to treat creep-tow as a collectible, for tax purposes, as opposed to a capital asset. I believe that they may have done this to penalize or otherwise restrict one’s ability to trade such alternative currency token and recognize long term capital gains preferential tax treatment.  
However, the unintended consequence is that as a collectible, alternative currency tokens are NOT subject to the dreaded “Wash Sales” rule.  
Meaning, if you bought said token at high price and the price falls substantially, and you believe that the price could return to said high price, you can sell said token at the lower price, recognizing a loss on the sale of an asset, and then turn right around and repurchase said token at the same or similar price.  
That recognized loss could then be used, eventually, to offset any short-term capital gains, dollar-for-dollar.  
Talk about cutting off your nose to spite your face, gives a new meaning to short-sightedness on the part of Uncle Sam.  I wonder if that was in their calculus when they determined to treat such assets as collectibles, as opposed to capital assets?",,

Probably wont get there, but sometimes you can profit even if it isn’t ITM, just due to the possibility. 

But again, options is mostly burning your money, for WSB plays I think shorting is the best, you do have to have an appetite for wide swings and wide stop losses, cause these things move wildy sometimes. Also I wouldn’t short GME, not because I think it isn’t a shit stock (it is), but because the price swings are so ridiculous it tends to blow up any sensible stop loss.

Your risk is never limited with any types of options, period. If you pay $100 premium for a naked call and it expires worthless you lose full $100

If you buy a call at $150 and sell a call at a higher strike for $50, your net debit is $100. If stock closes below both strikes then you lose full $100.

Now tell me how are you limiting the loss here by spread?

&#x200B;

>**I do my current average is around 60% per spread and these are just weekly ones**

You might get 60% average return weekly for a brief amount of time but it's not sustainable. I made 4000% on a week but I will not claim that I can do that in a consistent way for a long time. A 60% weekly return is basically

**(1.6)\^50 = 16,069,380,442% (considering there are 50 weeks of trading)**

That means if you invest $1 you will have 16 billion dollars by years end if you reinvest everything every week. Possible? NO.

Even if you do not reinvest the profit and use the same capital every week and withdraw all the profit, **that's still 3000% yearly return**. Again not possible.

Please think before making a claim what that claim actually means.",,

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Their next earnings are slated for 6/10/21 after market close.

I don't know if this next line is necessary or not but just to be safe....I'm not a professional financial advisor and this is not investment advice.",nk79sh,$CHWY - Earnings coming up - huge upside potential

If the calls expire OTM then it's another monthly covered calls. I truly believe in BNGO which is why I have about 200 other calls on the side for the long term.

The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don’t think it holds up with Zillow. I know their software is great for their agents on the backend, but not into it as a consumer. Overall I like it as a long-term play.

7319,,2021-05-25 02:00:02,t3_nkedem,,wallstreetbets,"I want to preface this by saying that I’m primarily a value investor (although many of my clients do own growth stocks) so my area of expertise isn’t necessarily on growth stocks like PENN. With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can’t necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what’s to come. So, let’s take a look at PENN’s growth. 

In 2015 Penn’s revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN’s revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN’s debt to asset ratio of 80% isn’t terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN’s partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

Thanks for reading this. If you liked my analysis and are curious about a company’s value, feel free to let me know.",nkedem,Should you bet on PENN?

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,The PLUG Restatement: A Great Chance to Get Out

Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.  There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".  The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.  Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.  In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.  In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.    


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.  While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?  Good question.  I don't know yet.  Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.  Another good question.  I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?  The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.  They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.  This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.  *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**    


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.  And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?  I don't know, but here's a scary graph.  So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.  Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.  Not significantly.  After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.  So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.  Doesn't seem like much.  But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.  I went down another rabbit hole.  1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?  The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.  Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.  Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).  It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.  After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.  And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.  When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?  A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.  But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.  

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.  Short the S&P there.  


Or you could just go to the source, nevermind, retail traders can't get any accurate, up to date, actionable market data.  You can go to the fed, but it's 3 days late.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

**This week's things to watch for:**

  
Tomorrow we also get the results from the Richmond manufacturing index and Consumer confidence.  

Last week, the Empire Index was up (barely) though the prices paid were higher (higher inflation).  The Philly index was down, and prices paid were at 40 year highs.  Tomorrow is Richmond.  Where the fuck is Richmond?  Thursday is unemployment claims, and Friday is another print of CPI.  But it's on a holiday weekend.  So responses should be muted.  If bad, look for a bloody Tuesday.  If good, fuck it, why not?  All time highs again.

In short, no.

SelfWealth members have been allowed to buy and sell GME as  well as others like AMC, throughout the entirety of 2021. This is in  stark comparison to other platforms that entirely halted the trading of  certain stocks.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

my god..

and also they retain the voting rights?! i want out but i dont know who else allows buying of gme and amc... i had a stake account but they stopped letting people buy shares back in January and that's when i got into selfwealth and have been ever since but finding this out today is quiet frightening..

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME –  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.  These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",nkk4c1,where to buy GME stocks in Australia?! SelfWealth is evil and stake was dodgy!

you can legally yolo all your money into a horrible option, and you can become a homeless person or billionaire at any given time. What is the difference between these 2 groups, well to me it is structure.

&#x200B;

You may be saying, 'well I have my trading system so I am good right?', no - you are not. You are missing 50% of the equation. Hear me out:

&#x200B;

A trading STRUCTURE is what should house, or literally be the roof and foundation for your SYSTEM. Imagine a trading system being a furnace, it cannot keep you warm and safe without a roof, walls, and foundation. So, what is my structure and system; here ya go:

&#x200B;

Trading Structure (Literal Home):

**Foundation**: Risk Management - All decisions, all other elements, and all trades are GROUNDED in risk management. I get it, 'Apes Stick Together' or whatever, but I use stop losses - I enter every trade with a set loss and take profit. I do not get emotional, I have a plan, and each trade is a 3 reward to 1 risk setup at least for a small move.

**Walls**: I base my 4 balls of success on:

1. 3 Analysis: 
   1. **Fundamental Analysis** based on news, P/E Ratio, Floats, EPS, etc. 
   2. **Technical Analysis** based on charts, graphs, value. If you are one of those 'AsTrOlOgY fOr IdIoTs' people, fine but understand you are handicapping yourself due to your own ego.
   3. **Mental Analysis** based on confidence, execution, and planning.
2. **Macro Economic** moves like inflation rates, money supply, consumer confidence; and Indexes like S&P, Nasdaq, DOW30, Russell2000, etc. I also study the 11 sectors intently too.
3. **Trading Plan** that includes a stop loss, a loading or buying zone, a price target, and an exit strategy and entry strategy already planned.
4. **Goal Setting** for my 1 month, 6 month, 1 year, 5 year, etc.... and what each trade does to help these goals.

From there my '**ROOF**' or my added protection is consistency. I stick to these rules. Before every trade, I double check with my 'roof' that I am being consistent. When I am in a trade, I check to make sure I am being consistent. When I exit - guess what, I check I am being consistent.

There will be some nights we would all enjoy and actually benefit from not having a roof. Those 73 degree, sunny days come - and we may enjoy sleeping in a tent or even sleeping with the sound of toad ribbits and cricket songs, and we give that up.

I want to call attention to the fact that GME has been consolidating for 2 months and looks just about ready to launch. Check the chart below courtesy of traderstewie. For months GME has been tightening and building higher lows on the daily and weekly. The key level to break out of the wedge is \~190 which we're pretty much exactly at now. Above $190 the path looks open to $300+.

**What I'm saying my friends is that GME is starting to look like a rocket launch site.**

The only thing missing is VOLUME. SPCE & TSLA look interesting but what we're seeing in GME is 5-star. Think maybe it's time we get the band back together.

Not advice, I just like the stock. Do you?

*As always, do your own due diligence. Knowing how to read charts can make you slightly more likely to catch break outs and mitigate losses but there is always uncertainty. Don't speculate with $ you can't afford to lose.*

7354,,2021-05-25 16:18:02,t3_nktkfy,,wallstreetbets,"The US House of Representatives passed a bill last month that would allow banks to provide services to cannabis companies in the US. Thus, the banks would no longer operate illegal and unlawful financing should they offer loans and other services to the companies. That would be a huge step in removing what analysts are calling an obstacle to the development of a national cannabis industry.

Legislators voted for the bill with 321-101 votes and sent it to the Senate.

https://preview.redd.it/5mpqdo4tja171.jpg?width=660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1255ec4f5a2471772ca27ad86ea25c16167d241b

The bill clarifies that proceeds from legal cannabis deals are not considered illegal and instructs federal regulators to create rules on how they would oversee such banking activities. Banks have so far been unwilling to do business with companies that sell marijuana or related products, fearing they could run into conflict with US federal law. This has left marijuana companies with few options to rely on a handful of small financial institutions or do cash deals. The American Bankers Association has aggressively lobbied for the SAFE Banking Act bill.

The banks have been in a difficult position due to the conflict between state and federal law, so it makes sense that Congress must act now to resolve this conflict. Thirty-six US states have now legalized medical cannabis, while 17 states already allow recreational use of cannabis by adults.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would try to push legislation. The positive reaction of the stock prices of Tilray, Sundial Growers, Aphria or Aurora Cannabis shows the great relief of investors. Investors hope that this could have kicked off further progressive reforms in the cannabis sector. This move took the potential of a game-changing marijuana law an important step forward.

If Congress passes the SAFE Banking Act and President Joe Biden signs it, it would likely become much easier and cheaper for marijuana companies to raise the capital they need to fund their growth initiatives. The law should also make cannabis companies safer and more efficient, as credit services would reduce the need for cash in day-to-day operations.

7358,,2021-05-25 17:28:55,t3_nkv7q2,,wallstreetbets,"Something interesting happened today. Vimeo, the video hosting service that is 100x better than YouTube but still nobody knows about (except losers like me) just had it's IPO today and it got fucked!

Currently the stock is down 15-20% from the opening bell. Who cares? Nobody is fever-buying IPOs like they were late last year or early this year. But this is actually the perfect time to buy in. Why? Well this IPO is actually occurring exactly when YouTube is just about to fuck over all of the business YouTube accounts in the USA.

What is YouTube doing to fuck over businesses? Well they are starting to run ads on non-partnered content. See source here, from the November terms of use update: [https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719)

If you don't want to read this, basically it says that channels that aren't partners are now going to get ads on their videos and YouTube is keeping ALL of the revenue (fuck you, right?). I've personally already witnessed this because I manage YT channels for several businesses and I've already gotten ads. And guess who gets a call every time their client sees an ad on their videos? Me, I get the call. 

&#x200B;

**When does this happen?**

It's already started. I've started seeing ads on corporate non-monetized and uncopyrighted videos within the last couple weeks, but the change is supposed to be implemented across the country in June. I've already been getting calls from my boss and from clients. We are already moving a lot of content to Vimeo.

&#x200B;

**Why does this matter?** 

Businesses are not going to be happy if their competitors are running ads on their videos. Especially if that ad occurs when the video is embedded on their own website. I know for a fact that ads are showing in YouTube but there has been no distinction that I'm aware of that would prohibit them from running ads in embedded videos on a website or blog. 

&#x200B;

**What is going to happen?**

If businesses start seeing competitor ads on their videos, they will do everything they can to stop it. They can either join the YPP and disable ads or they can leave the platform. However, there are requirements to the YPP:

1. They must have 1,000 subscribers
2. They must have 4,000 watch hours in the last 12 months

I can promise you that most businesses do not even come close to meeting these requirements. They can try to purchase subscribers or views but YouTube is good at identifying this. Trust me, I've gone down that road and have seen channels get taken down because of it.

&#x200B;

**Why is VMEO the best play here?**

The main reason is because businesses will leave YouTube.

Vimeo is hand-down my favorite video hosting service for a few reasons:

* The video encode quality is visibly better
* The embedded player is 100% customizable
* It's easier to pick thumbnails
* It has a built-in review system for businesses
* And the best feature, you can update videos without changing the URL (very helpful for embedding)

What's the drawback? It costs $7/month for most of these features. But businesses will gladly pay that to not have their competitors on their website/videos.

Positions: Shares 11 VMEO @ $43.25. I'll be loading up more soon.",nkv7q2,VMEO's IPO had perfect timing (and not by accident)

This is not a financial Advise,

RBLX has been on a bull run for past week and more. I wanted to to highlight few critical points here.

RBLX is approaching its resistance, Bearish in short term.  
It might fight $90 for 1 or 2 days, and then retrace to 21 ema (must be close to the ascending support line around $72) Wise decision would be to close a position now and re-enter at a lower price.  
Another data point to be cautions, analysts 12 month high price target - $90.

It started when I had the prophetic revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector. And because increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I stopped smoking weed.  My first thought was that if the government doesn’t release the report then I’m fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report sometime in June. However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it’s another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  After every national emergency, such as saying this is foreign tech would be, it has caused defense contract stocks to go up 5-10%. Also many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.  Finally I looked up ufo on google trends today and it is up 3x its 12 month average.  Google trends have been shown to foresee increase in prices.

Their app does not direct users to switch to Uber eats (as Postmates is almost completely defunct) and their support staff were not trained on how to support Postmates, so they are giving negative interactions every time a user requests help (eg. Here's how you fix it in the Uber app!)  


There's at least one month of completely lost revenue for a large portion of the assumed captured monthly recurring revenue that Postmates would have added to the books for Ubereats.  Instead, the only uplift they'll get is people starting to use the Uber Eats app.

However, this revenue will not be recaptured as they also changed the distance algorithm to be more resitrictive, so rural Americans (who Postmates had manually tweaked some of the routes for) will no longer, by and large, be able to order from anywhere near as many restaurants as they used to.

I suspect that even with more people travelling, this (in combination with additional regulation) will actually push Uber into a red quarter.  Also, any competing app that recaptures this revenue (Doordash/Grubhub/PizzaHut/Dominoes) will likely get an uplift as the negative support effect will drive people to other apps, and likely to just call the Chinese or pizza places in their rural town that deliver first party.

They're a good source of protein, environmentally friendly, they're crunchy, you can make bread with them, and cockroaches are fuckin sturdy.  Nuclear war?  No problem.  The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.  That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.  

And then the fuckin cicadas came.  Not a problem, right?  That happens reliably on 17 year cycles, should be priced in.  Except that they came *early*.  Nobody's talking about this but everyone in the cockroach community knows.  The rats have been feasting on these things.  It only takes them three weeks to breed.  And since the rat population is already booming, you retards can do the math.  Oh christ, they're going to be everywhere.  I already see them lurking in the grass.  We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  

You know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.  My wife and my wife's boyfriend left me at this point because I had not a penny to my name.  And you'd think they'd deliver 'em dead, right?  Nope!  Now I have literal tons of cockroaches crawling around my house and as a bonus they're attracting more rats cause apparently I'm not the only one who thinks they're a good source of protein.  And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.  

tl;dr I'm broke, I'm starving, my house is gone, and I'm probably gonna get eaten by rats.  Never, ever buy cockroach futures.",nk4z03,I am financially ruined and my life is hell thanks to cockroach futures

7783,,2021-05-24 18:49:18,t3_nk56mr,,wallstreetbets,"So for those of you who aren't nerds that pay attention to military procurement and DoD fuckery, you might've missed the fact that the DoD is considering shelving the entire 10-billion dollar JEDI contract for the simple fact that the bidders are having an all out legal battle to see who deserves the contract. 

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn’t brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD’s Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> “While all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we’re risking is just different stovepipes,” Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. “**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**” 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM’s Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

By end of the year, # of markets will be doubled from last year

For the second quarter of 2021, revenue is expected to be between **$1.025 billion and $1.075 billion,** which represents **41% sequential growth over 1Q21** at the midpoint of the expected range.

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 6 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is just about over, so there is a good chance that this is going to be the final spreadsheet until Q2 rolls around. Thank you all for joining me for the ride!

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It’s an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What’s not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they’re one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I’ve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I’d love to see what you guys come up with.

7793,,2021-05-24 19:42:47,t3_nk6fnw,,wallstreetbets,"Well, the commodity market has been on fire. The question is... is that gonna continue? 
While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and copper for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc) 
I am long on TRQ .",nk6fnw,$TRQ and the Copper/Gold play

It seems to me that this is an important market indicator - if the CEO of a large company sells most of his stock or buys more, this indirectly determines the company's performance and the mood of employees. Of course, insider trading based on non-public information is illegal. However, when the company's employees buy or sell its shares in large quantities, it is completely legal and an important indicator of its affairs.

I’ve been collecting information from Nasdaq and other official sources. Then I aggregated it by months and got two lists as a result - the first is the top 5 companies by insider buying activity and the second is Top 5 by Insider selling activity.

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Their next earnings are slated for 6/10/21 after market close.

Last week I sold calls for the first time and I decided to go all in. I had about $2,780 invested in QYLD which gave me about $343 a year and $28.6 a month. I decided to retire this investment and use it to buy 500 shares of BNGO at about $5.54. I then sold 5 $6 June 18, covered calls for $245 premium which will cover my monthly hooker expense, for legal reasons that's a joke. Already I earned 70% of what QYLD would have payed me in a year.

 If my calls expire in the money then I'll make about a $300 profit for a total $545 profit in just one month. Then I'll just sell some cash covered puts then rinse and repeat. If the calls expire OTM then it's another monthly covered calls. I truly believe in BNGO which is why I have about 200 other calls on the side for the long term.

The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don’t think it holds up with Zillow. I know their software is great for their agents on the backend, but not into it as a consumer. Overall I like it as a long-term play. Their revenue growth over the next few years should drive it up nicely.",nkdxwl,$COMP is well priced. (Imo)

7819,,2021-05-25 02:00:02,t3_nkedem,,wallstreetbets,"I want to preface this by saying that I’m primarily a value investor (although many of my clients do own growth stocks) so my area of expertise isn’t necessarily on growth stocks like PENN. With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can’t necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what’s to come. So, let’s take a look at PENN’s growth. 

In 2015 Penn’s revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN’s revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN’s debt to asset ratio of 80% isn’t terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN’s partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

Thanks for reading this. If you liked my analysis and are curious about a company’s value, feel free to let me know.",nkedem,Should you bet on PENN?

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,The PLUG Restatement: A Great Chance to Get Out

Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.  There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".  The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.  Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.  In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.  In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.    


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.  While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?  Good question.  I don't know yet.  Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.  Another good question.  I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?  The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.  They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.  This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.  *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**    


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.  And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?  I don't know, but here's a scary graph.  So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.  Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.  Not significantly.  After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.  So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.  Doesn't seem like much.  But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.  I went down another rabbit hole.  1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?  The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.  Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.  Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).  It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.  After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.  And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.  When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?  A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.  But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.  

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.  Short the S&P there.  


Or you could just go to the source, nevermind, retail traders can't get any accurate, up to date, actionable market data.  You can go to the fed, but it's 3 days late.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

**This week's things to watch for:**

  
Tomorrow we also get the results from the Richmond manufacturing index and Consumer confidence.  

Last week, the Empire Index was up (barely) though the prices paid were higher (higher inflation).  The Philly index was down, and prices paid were at 40 year highs.  Tomorrow is Richmond.  Where the fuck is Richmond?  Thursday is unemployment claims, and Friday is another print of CPI.  But it's on a holiday weekend.  So responses should be muted.  If bad, look for a bloody Tuesday.  If good, fuck it, why not?  All time highs again.

In short, no.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

and also they retain the voting rights?! i want out but i dont know who else allows buying of gme and amc... i had a stake account but they stopped letting people buy shares back in January and that's when i got into selfwealth and have been ever since but finding this out today is quiet frightening..

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME –  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.  These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",nkk4c1,where to buy GME stocks in Australia?! SelfWealth is evil and stake was dodgy!

you can legally yolo all your money into a horrible option, and you can become a homeless person or billionaire at any given time. What is the difference between these 2 groups, well to me it is structure.

&#x200B;

You may be saying, 'well I have my trading system so I am good right?', no - you are not. You are missing 50% of the equation. Hear me out:

&#x200B;

A trading STRUCTURE is what should house, or literally be the roof and foundation for your SYSTEM. Imagine a trading system being a furnace, it cannot keep you warm and safe without a roof, walls, and foundation. So, what is my structure and system; here ya go:

&#x200B;

Trading Structure (Literal Home):

**Foundation**: Risk Management - All decisions, all other elements, and all trades are GROUNDED in risk management. I get it, 'Apes Stick Together' or whatever, but I use stop losses - I enter every trade with a set loss and take profit. I do not get emotional, I have a plan, and each trade is a 3 reward to 1 risk setup at least for a small move.

**Walls**: I base my 4 balls of success on:

1. 3 Analysis: 
   1. **Fundamental Analysis** based on news, P/E Ratio, Floats, EPS, etc. 
   2. **Technical Analysis** based on charts, graphs, value. If you are one of those 'AsTrOlOgY fOr IdIoTs' people, fine but understand you are handicapping yourself due to your own ego.
   3. **Mental Analysis** based on confidence, execution, and planning.
2. **Macro Economic** moves like inflation rates, money supply, consumer confidence; and Indexes like S&P, Nasdaq, DOW30, Russell2000, etc. I also study the 11 sectors intently too.
3. **Trading Plan** that includes a stop loss, a loading or buying zone, a price target, and an exit strategy and entry strategy already planned.
4. **Goal Setting** for my 1 month, 6 month, 1 year, 5 year, etc.... and what each trade does to help these goals.

From there my '**ROOF**' or my added protection is consistency. I stick to these rules. Before every trade, I double check with my 'roof' that I am being consistent. When I am in a trade, I check to make sure I am being consistent. When I exit - guess what, I check I am being consistent.

There will be some nights we would all enjoy and actually benefit from not having a roof. Those 73 degree, sunny days come - and we may enjoy sleeping in a tent or even sleeping with the sound of toad ribbits and cricket songs, and we give that up. We do because there are also hurricane level monsoons and without a roof, your whole room will be ruined (blowing up your account).

&#x200B;

From there, you place your SYSTEM in this STRUCTURE. Scalping, great. Day trader, beautiful. Swing, long term, only ETF, dividends!? That is fine. Anytime frame, any short term goal, and account size; all of the things that make your TRADING EDGE or SYSTEM goes into the STRUCUTRE.

&#x200B;

Please have both. Please have rules. Please understand you are in a chaotic neutral system, with 0 rules, 0 guidance, 0 anything. You either create your own structure, or have none. You fail to plan, than you're planning to fail. Good luck.",nkq9et,The Difference Between A Trading Structure And A Trading System

I want to call attention to the fact that GME has been consolidating for 2 months and looks just about ready to launch. Check the chart below courtesy of traderstewie. For months GME has been tightening and building higher lows on the daily and weekly. The key level to break out of the wedge is \~190 which we're pretty much exactly at now. Above $190 the path looks open to $300+.

**What I'm saying my friends is that GME is starting to look like a rocket launch site.**

The only thing missing is VOLUME. SPCE & TSLA look interesting but what we're seeing in GME is 5-star. Think maybe it's time we get the band back together.

Not advice, I just like the stock. Do you?

*As always, do your own due diligence. Knowing how to read charts can make you slightly more likely to catch break outs and mitigate losses but there is always uncertainty. Don't speculate with $ you can't afford to lose.*

Thus, the banks would no longer operate illegal and unlawful financing should they offer loans and other services to the companies. That would be a huge step in removing what analysts are calling an obstacle to the development of a national cannabis industry.

Legislators voted for the bill with 321-101 votes and sent it to the Senate.

https://preview.redd.it/5mpqdo4tja171.jpg?width=660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1255ec4f5a2471772ca27ad86ea25c16167d241b

The bill clarifies that proceeds from legal cannabis deals are not considered illegal and instructs federal regulators to create rules on how they would oversee such banking activities. Banks have so far been unwilling to do business with companies that sell marijuana or related products, fearing they could run into conflict with US federal law. This has left marijuana companies with few options to rely on a handful of small financial institutions or do cash deals. The American Bankers Association has aggressively lobbied for the SAFE Banking Act bill.

The banks have been in a difficult position due to the conflict between state and federal law, so it makes sense that Congress must act now to resolve this conflict. Thirty-six US states have now legalized medical cannabis, while 17 states already allow recreational use of cannabis by adults.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would try to push legislation. The positive reaction of the stock prices of Tilray, Sundial Growers, Aphria or Aurora Cannabis shows the great relief of investors. Investors hope that this could have kicked off further progressive reforms in the cannabis sector. This move took the potential of a game-changing marijuana law an important step forward.

If Congress passes the SAFE Banking Act and President Joe Biden signs it, it would likely become much easier and cheaper for marijuana companies to raise the capital they need to fund their growth initiatives. The law should also make cannabis companies safer and more efficient, as credit services would reduce the need for cash in day-to-day operations.

Currently the stock is down 15-20% from the opening bell. Who cares? Nobody is fever-buying IPOs like they were late last year or early this year. But this is actually the perfect time to buy in. Why? Well this IPO is actually occurring exactly when YouTube is just about to fuck over all of the business YouTube accounts in the USA.

What is YouTube doing to fuck over businesses? Well they are starting to run ads on non-partnered content. See source here, from the November terms of use update: [https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719)

If you don't want to read this, basically it says that channels that aren't partners are now going to get ads on their videos and YouTube is keeping ALL of the revenue (fuck you, right?). I've personally already witnessed this because I manage YT channels for several businesses and I've already gotten ads. And guess who gets a call every time their client sees an ad on their videos? Me, I get the call. 

&#x200B;

**When does this happen?**

It's already started. I've started seeing ads on corporate non-monetized and uncopyrighted videos within the last couple weeks, but the change is supposed to be implemented across the country in June. I've already been getting calls from my boss and from clients. We are already moving a lot of content to Vimeo.

&#x200B;

**Why does this matter?** 

Businesses are not going to be happy if their competitors are running ads on their videos. Especially if that ad occurs when the video is embedded on their own website. I know for a fact that ads are showing in YouTube but there has been no distinction that I'm aware of that would prohibit them from running ads in embedded videos on a website or blog. 

&#x200B;

**What is going to happen?**

If businesses start seeing competitor ads on their videos, they will do everything they can to stop it. They can either join the YPP and disable ads or they can leave the platform. However, there are requirements to the YPP:

1. They must have 1,000 subscribers
2. They must have 4,000 watch hours in the last 12 months

I can promise you that most businesses do not even come close to meeting these requirements. They can try to purchase subscribers or views but YouTube is good at identifying this. Trust me, I've gone down that road and have seen channels get taken down because of it.

&#x200B;

**Why is VMEO the best play here?**

The main reason is because businesses will leave YouTube.

Vimeo is hand-down my favorite video hosting service for a few reasons:

* The video encode quality is visibly better
* The embedded player is 100% customizable
* It's easier to pick thumbnails
* It has a built-in review system for businesses
* And the best feature, you can update videos without changing the URL (very helpful for embedding)

What's the drawback? It costs $7/month for most of these features. But businesses will gladly pay that to not have their competitors on their website/videos.

This is not a financial Advise,

RBLX has been on a bull run for past week and more. I wanted to to highlight few critical points here.

RBLX is approaching its resistance, Bearish in short term.  
It might fight $90 for 1 or 2 days, and then retrace to 21 ema (must be close to the ascending support line around $72) Wise decision would be to close a position now and re-enter at a lower price.  
Another data point to be cautions, analysts 12 month high price target - $90.

It started when I had the prophetic revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector. And because increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I stopped smoking weed.  My first thought was that if the government doesn’t release the report then I’m fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report sometime in June. However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it’s another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.

I think the disclosure stuff has been happening because people that were inside of the government thought it was messed up that the tech wouldn't be shared to transform society and make things better.

Their app does not direct users to switch to Uber eats (as Postmates is almost completely defunct) and their support staff were not trained on how to support Postmates, so they are giving negative interactions every time a user requests help (eg. Here's how you fix it in the Uber app!)  


There's at least one month of completely lost revenue for a large portion of the assumed captured monthly recurring revenue that Postmates would have added to the books for Ubereats.  Instead, the only uplift they'll get is people starting to use the Uber Eats app.

However, this revenue will not be recaptured as they also changed the distance algorithm to be more resitrictive, so rural Americans (who Postmates had manually tweaked some of the routes for) will no longer, by and large, be able to order from anywhere near as many restaurants as they used to.

I suspect that even with more people travelling, this (in combination with additional regulation) will actually push Uber into a red quarter.  Also, any competing app that recaptures this revenue (Doordash/Grubhub/PizzaHut/Dominoes) will likely get an uplift as the negative support effect will drive people to other apps, and likely to just call the Chinese or pizza places in their rural town that deliver first party.

The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.  That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.  

And then the fuckin cicadas came.  Not a problem, right?  That happens reliably on 17 year cycles, should be priced in.  Except that they came *early*.  Nobody's talking about this but everyone in the cockroach community knows.  The rats have been feasting on these things.  It only takes them three weeks to breed.  And since the rat population is already booming, you retards can do the math.  Oh christ, they're going to be everywhere.  I already see them lurking in the grass.  We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  

You know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.  My wife and my wife's boyfriend left me at this point because I had not a penny to my name.  And you'd think they'd deliver 'em dead, right?  Nope!  Now I have literal tons of cockroaches crawling around my house and as a bonus they're attracting more rats cause apparently I'm not the only one who thinks they're a good source of protein.  And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.  

tl;dr I'm broke, I'm starving, my house is gone, and I'm probably gonna get eaten by rats.  Never, ever buy cockroach futures.",nk4z03,I am financially ruined and my life is hell thanks to cockroach futures

8020,,2021-05-24 18:49:18,t3_nk56mr,,wallstreetbets,"So for those of you who aren't nerds that pay attention to military procurement and DoD fuckery, you might've missed the fact that the DoD is considering shelving the entire 10-billion dollar JEDI contract for the simple fact that the bidders are having an all out legal battle to see who deserves the contract. 

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn’t brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD’s Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> “While all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we’re risking is just different stovepipes,” Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. “**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**” 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM’s Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 6 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is just about over, so there is a good chance that this is going to be the final spreadsheet until Q2 rolls around. Thank you all for joining me for the ride!

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It’s an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What’s not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they’re one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I’ve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I’d love to see what you guys come up with.

8030,,2021-05-24 19:42:47,t3_nk6fnw,,wallstreetbets,"Well, the commodity market has been on fire. The question is... is that gonna continue? 
While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and copper for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc) 
I am long on TRQ .",nk6fnw,$TRQ and the Copper/Gold play

It seems to me that this is an important market indicator - if the CEO of a large company sells most of his stock or buys more, this indirectly determines the company's performance and the mood of employees. Of course, insider trading based on non-public information is illegal. However, when the company's employees buy or sell its shares in large quantities, it is completely legal and an important indicator of its affairs.

I’ve been collecting information from Nasdaq and other official sources. Then I aggregated it by months and got two lists as a result - the first is the top 5 companies by insider buying activity and the second is Top 5 by Insider selling activity.

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Their next earnings are slated for 6/10/21 after market close.

Last week I sold calls for the first time and I decided to go all in. I had about $2,780 invested in QYLD which gave me about $343 a year and $28.6 a month. I decided to retire this investment and use it to buy 500 shares of BNGO at about $5.54. I then sold 5 $6 June 18, covered calls for $245 premium which will cover my monthly hooker expense, for legal reasons that's a joke. Already I earned 70% of what QYLD would have payed me in a year.

 If my calls expire in the money then I'll make about a $300 profit for a total $545 profit in just one month. Then I'll just sell some cash covered puts then rinse and repeat. If the calls expire OTM then it's another monthly covered calls. I truly believe in BNGO which is why I have about 200 other calls on the side for the long term.

The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don’t think it holds up with Zillow. I know their software is great for their agents on the backend, but not into it as a consumer. Overall I like it as a long-term play. Their revenue growth over the next few years should drive it up nicely.",nkdxwl,$COMP is well priced. (Imo)

8056,,2021-05-25 02:00:02,t3_nkedem,,wallstreetbets,"I want to preface this by saying that I’m primarily a value investor (although many of my clients do own growth stocks) so my area of expertise isn’t necessarily on growth stocks like PENN. With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can’t necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what’s to come. So, let’s take a look at PENN’s growth. 

In 2015 Penn’s revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN’s revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN’s debt to asset ratio of 80% isn’t terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN’s partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,The PLUG Restatement: A Great Chance to Get Out

Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.  There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".  The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.  Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.  In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.  In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.    


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.  While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?  Good question.  I don't know yet.  Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.  Another good question.  I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?  The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.  They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.  This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.  *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**    


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.  And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?  I don't know, but here's a scary graph.  So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.  Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.  Not significantly.  After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.  So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.  Doesn't seem like much.  But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.  I went down another rabbit hole.  1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?  The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.  Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.  Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).  It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.  After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.  And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.  When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?  A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.  But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.  

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.  Short the S&P there.  


Or you could just go to the source, nevermind, retail traders can't get any accurate, up to date, actionable market data.  You can go to the fed, but it's 3 days late.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

**This week's things to watch for:**

  
Tomorrow we also get the results from the Richmond manufacturing index and Consumer confidence.  

Last week, the Empire Index was up (barely) though the prices paid were higher (higher inflation).  The Philly index was down, and prices paid were at 40 year highs.  Tomorrow is Richmond.  Where the fuck is Richmond?  Thursday is unemployment claims, and Friday is another print of CPI.  But it's on a holiday weekend.  So responses should be muted.  If bad, look for a bloody Tuesday.  If good, fuck it, why not?  All time highs again.

In short, no.

SelfWealth members have been allowed to buy and sell GME as  well as others like AMC, throughout the entirety of 2021. This is in  stark comparison to other platforms that entirely halted the trading of  certain stocks.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

and also they retain the voting rights?! i want out but i dont know who else allows buying of gme and amc... i had a stake account but they stopped letting people buy shares back in January and that's when i got into selfwealth and have been ever since but finding this out today is quiet frightening..

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME –  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.  These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",nkk4c1,where to buy GME stocks in Australia?! SelfWealth is evil and stake was dodgy!

you can legally yolo all your money into a horrible option, and you can become a homeless person or billionaire at any given time. What is the difference between these 2 groups, well to me it is structure.

&#x200B;

You may be saying, 'well I have my trading system so I am good right?', no - you are not. You are missing 50% of the equation. Hear me out:

&#x200B;

A trading STRUCTURE is what should house, or literally be the roof and foundation for your SYSTEM. Imagine a trading system being a furnace, it cannot keep you warm and safe without a roof, walls, and foundation. So, what is my structure and system; here ya go:

&#x200B;

Trading Structure (Literal Home):

**Foundation**: Risk Management - All decisions, all other elements, and all trades are GROUNDED in risk management. I get it, 'Apes Stick Together' or whatever, but I use stop losses - I enter every trade with a set loss and take profit. I do not get emotional, I have a plan, and each trade is a 3 reward to 1 risk setup at least for a small move.

**Walls**: I base my 4 balls of success on:

1. 3 Analysis: 
   1. **Fundamental Analysis** based on news, P/E Ratio, Floats, EPS, etc. 
   2. **Technical Analysis** based on charts, graphs, value. If you are one of those 'AsTrOlOgY fOr IdIoTs' people, fine but understand you are handicapping yourself due to your own ego.
   3. **Mental Analysis** based on confidence, execution, and planning.
2. **Macro Economic** moves like inflation rates, money supply, consumer confidence; and Indexes like S&P, Nasdaq, DOW30, Russell2000, etc. I also study the 11 sectors intently too.
3. **Trading Plan** that includes a stop loss, a loading or buying zone, a price target, and an exit strategy and entry strategy already planned.
4. **Goal Setting** for my 1 month, 6 month, 1 year, 5 year, etc.... and what each trade does to help these goals.

From there my '**ROOF**' or my added protection is consistency. I stick to these rules. Before every trade, I double check with my 'roof' that I am being consistent. When I am in a trade, I check to make sure I am being consistent. When I exit - guess what, I check I am being consistent.

There will be some nights we would all enjoy and actually benefit from not having a roof. Those 73 degree, sunny days come - and we may enjoy sleeping in a tent or even sleeping with the sound of toad ribbits and cricket songs, and we give that up. We do because there are also hurricane level monsoons and without a roof, your whole room will be ruined (blowing up your account).

&#x200B;

From there, you place your SYSTEM in this STRUCTURE. Scalping, great. Day trader, beautiful. Swing, long term, only ETF, dividends!? That is fine. Anytime frame, any short term goal, and account size; all of the things that make your TRADING EDGE or SYSTEM goes into the STRUCUTRE.

&#x200B;

Please have both. Please have rules. Please understand you are in a chaotic neutral system, with 0 rules, 0 guidance, 0 anything. You either create your own structure, or have none. You fail to plan, than you're planning to fail. Good luck.",nkq9et,The Difference Between A Trading Structure And A Trading System

I want to call attention to the fact that GME has been consolidating for 2 months and looks just about ready to launch. Check the chart below courtesy of traderstewie. For months GME has been tightening and building higher lows on the daily and weekly. The key level to break out of the wedge is \~190 which we're pretty much exactly at now. Above $190 the path looks open to $300+.

**What I'm saying my friends is that GME is starting to look like a rocket launch site.**

The only thing missing is VOLUME. SPCE & TSLA look interesting but what we're seeing in GME is 5-star. Think maybe it's time we get the band back together.

Not advice, I just like the stock. Do you?

*As always, do your own due diligence. Knowing how to read charts can make you slightly more likely to catch break outs and mitigate losses but there is always uncertainty. Don't speculate with $ you can't afford to lose.*

Thus, the banks would no longer operate illegal and unlawful financing should they offer loans and other services to the companies. That would be a huge step in removing what analysts are calling an obstacle to the development of a national cannabis industry.

Legislators voted for the bill with 321-101 votes and sent it to the Senate.

https://preview.redd.it/5mpqdo4tja171.jpg?width=660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1255ec4f5a2471772ca27ad86ea25c16167d241b

The bill clarifies that proceeds from legal cannabis deals are not considered illegal and instructs federal regulators to create rules on how they would oversee such banking activities. Banks have so far been unwilling to do business with companies that sell marijuana or related products, fearing they could run into conflict with US federal law. This has left marijuana companies with few options to rely on a handful of small financial institutions or do cash deals. The American Bankers Association has aggressively lobbied for the SAFE Banking Act bill.

The banks have been in a difficult position due to the conflict between state and federal law, so it makes sense that Congress must act now to resolve this conflict. Thirty-six US states have now legalized medical cannabis, while 17 states already allow recreational use of cannabis by adults.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would try to push legislation. The positive reaction of the stock prices of Tilray, Sundial Growers, Aphria or Aurora Cannabis shows the great relief of investors. Investors hope that this could have kicked off further progressive reforms in the cannabis sector. This move took the potential of a game-changing marijuana law an important step forward.

If Congress passes the SAFE Banking Act and President Joe Biden signs it, it would likely become much easier and cheaper for marijuana companies to raise the capital they need to fund their growth initiatives. The law should also make cannabis companies safer and more efficient, as credit services would reduce the need for cash in day-to-day operations.

Currently the stock is down 15-20% from the opening bell. Who cares? Nobody is fever-buying IPOs like they were late last year or early this year. But this is actually the perfect time to buy in. Why? Well this IPO is actually occurring exactly when YouTube is just about to fuck over all of the business YouTube accounts in the USA.

What is YouTube doing to fuck over businesses? Well they are starting to run ads on non-partnered content. See source here, from the November terms of use update: [https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719)

If you don't want to read this, basically it says that channels that aren't partners are now going to get ads on their videos and YouTube is keeping ALL of the revenue (fuck you, right?). I've personally already witnessed this because I manage YT channels for several businesses and I've already gotten ads. And guess who gets a call every time their client sees an ad on their videos? Me, I get the call. 

&#x200B;

**When does this happen?**

It's already started. I've started seeing ads on corporate non-monetized and uncopyrighted videos within the last couple weeks, but the change is supposed to be implemented across the country in June. I've already been getting calls from my boss and from clients. We are already moving a lot of content to Vimeo.

&#x200B;

**Why does this matter?** 

Businesses are not going to be happy if their competitors are running ads on their videos. Especially if that ad occurs when the video is embedded on their own website. I know for a fact that ads are showing in YouTube but there has been no distinction that I'm aware of that would prohibit them from running ads in embedded videos on a website or blog. 

&#x200B;

**What is going to happen?**

If businesses start seeing competitor ads on their videos, they will do everything they can to stop it. They can either join the YPP and disable ads or they can leave the platform. However, there are requirements to the YPP:

1. They must have 1,000 subscribers
2. They must have 4,000 watch hours in the last 12 months

I can promise you that most businesses do not even come close to meeting these requirements. They can try to purchase subscribers or views but YouTube is good at identifying this. Trust me, I've gone down that road and have seen channels get taken down because of it.

&#x200B;

**Why is VMEO the best play here?**

The main reason is because businesses will leave YouTube.

Vimeo is hand-down my favorite video hosting service for a few reasons:

* The video encode quality is visibly better
* The embedded player is 100% customizable
* It's easier to pick thumbnails
* It has a built-in review system for businesses
* And the best feature, you can update videos without changing the URL (very helpful for embedding)

What's the drawback? It costs $7/month for most of these features. But businesses will gladly pay that to not have their competitors on their website/videos.

This is not a financial Advise,

RBLX has been on a bull run for past week and more. I wanted to to highlight few critical points here.

RBLX is approaching its resistance, Bearish in short term.  
It might fight $90 for 1 or 2 days, and then retrace to 21 ema (must be close to the ascending support line around $72) Wise decision would be to close a position now and re-enter at a lower price.  
Another data point to be cautions, analysts 12 month high price target - $90.

It started when I had the prophetic revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector. And because increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I stopped smoking weed.  My first thought was that if the government doesn’t release the report then I’m fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report sometime in June. However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it’s another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  After every national emergency, such as saying this is foreign tech would be, it has caused defense contract stocks to go up 5-10%. Also many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.  Finally I looked up ufo on google trends today and it is up 3x its 12 month average.  Google trends have been shown to foresee increase in prices.

I think the disclosure stuff has been happening because people that were inside of the government thought it was messed up that the tech wouldn't be shared to transform society and make things better. 

My guess is it's anti-gravity/magnetism paired with warp technology and powered by low energy nuclear reactions. Pretty sure our military and specifically the navy has been working on this tech for awhile. I saw some patent stuff that someone had posted at some point.

GME has been consolidating between the bag holders of the first and second peaks. As you can see, on average, nobody is bag holding now. This is good sign for bulls. I would expect a retest of the 195/200 range. If that holds, it's game on.

Mods, this is a technical analysis post...not a freaking literary dissertation. Having a length requirement on a post that is obviously going to mostly consist of a picture is ridiculous. Bad Bot. 

&#x200B;

If we really need to get this longer then why don't I explain the significance of VWAP. It stands for volume weighted average price. It basically shows the price normalized by the volumes of buyers and sellers that have bought/sold in the past. Why is this important? It's important because it more accurately indicates where there are zones of overhead supply (bag holders waiting to sell once they break even) or pent up demand (most holders are feeling good and waiting to buy dips). In this case, price has been stuck between the psychology of two market participants; the bag holders and the (not?) bag holders. Now that price is above both VWAP levels, more market participants are ITM than not ITM. This means less selling pressure. This means moon.",nkz1y6,GME Anchored VWAP

They're a good source of protein, environmentally friendly, they're crunchy, you can make bread with them, and cockroaches are fuckin sturdy.  Nuclear war?  No problem.  The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.  That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.  

And then the fuckin cicadas came.  Not a problem, right?  That happens reliably on 17 year cycles, should be priced in.  Except that they came *early*.  Nobody's talking about this but everyone in the cockroach community knows.  The rats have been feasting on these things.  It only takes them three weeks to breed.  And since the rat population is already booming, you retards can do the math.  Oh christ, they're going to be everywhere.  I already see them lurking in the grass.  We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  

You know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.  My wife and my wife's boyfriend left me at this point because I had not a penny to my name.  And you'd think they'd deliver 'em dead, right?  Nope!  Now I have literal tons of cockroaches crawling around my house and as a bonus they're attracting more rats cause apparently I'm not the only one who thinks they're a good source of protein.  And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.  

tl;dr I'm broke, I'm starving, my house is gone, and I'm probably gonna get eaten by rats.  Never, ever buy cockroach futures.",nk4z03,I am financially ruined and my life is hell thanks to cockroach futures

9075,,2021-05-24 18:49:18,t3_nk56mr,,wallstreetbets,"So for those of you who aren't nerds that pay attention to military procurement and DoD fuckery, you might've missed the fact that the DoD is considering shelving the entire 10-billion dollar JEDI contract for the simple fact that the bidders are having an all out legal battle to see who deserves the contract. 

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn’t brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD’s Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> “While all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we’re risking is just different stovepipes,” Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. “**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**” 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM’s Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 6 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is just about over, so there is a good chance that this is going to be the final spreadsheet until Q2 rolls around. Thank you all for joining me for the ride!

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It’s an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What’s not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they’re one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I’ve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I’d love to see what you guys come up with.

9085,,2021-05-24 19:42:47,t3_nk6fnw,,wallstreetbets,"Well, the commodity market has been on fire. The question is... is that gonna continue? 
While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and copper for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc)

It seems to me that this is an important market indicator - if the CEO of a large company sells most of his stock or buys more, this indirectly determines the company's performance and the mood of employees. Of course, insider trading based on non-public information is illegal. However, when the company's employees buy or sell its shares in large quantities, it is completely legal and an important indicator of its affairs.

I’ve been collecting information from Nasdaq and other official sources. Then I aggregated it by months and got two lists as a result - the first is the top 5 companies by insider buying activity and the second is Top 5 by Insider selling activity.

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Their next earnings are slated for 6/10/21 after market close.

I don't know if this next line is necessary or not but just to be safe....I'm not a professional financial advisor and this is not investment advice.",nk79sh,$CHWY - Earnings coming up - huge upside potential

I decided to retire this investment and use it to buy 500 shares of BNGO at about $5.54. I then sold 5 $6 June 18, covered calls for $245 premium which will cover my monthly hooker expense, for legal reasons that's a joke. Already I earned 70% of what QYLD would have payed me in a year.

 If my calls expire in the money then I'll make about a $300 profit for a total $545 profit in just one month. Then I'll just sell some cash covered puts then rinse and repeat. If the calls expire OTM then it's another monthly covered calls. I truly believe in BNGO which is why I have about 200 other calls on the side for the long term.

The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don’t think it holds up with Zillow. I know their software is great for their agents on the backend, but not into it as a consumer. Overall I like it as a long-term play.

9111,,2021-05-25 02:00:02,t3_nkedem,,wallstreetbets,"I want to preface this by saying that I’m primarily a value investor (although many of my clients do own growth stocks) so my area of expertise isn’t necessarily on growth stocks like PENN. With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can’t necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what’s to come. So, let’s take a look at PENN’s growth. 

In 2015 Penn’s revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN’s revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN’s debt to asset ratio of 80% isn’t terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN’s partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,The PLUG Restatement: A Great Chance to Get Out

Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.  There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".  The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.  Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.  In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.  In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.    


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.  While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?  Good question.  I don't know yet.  Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.  Another good question.  I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?  The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.  They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.  This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.  *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**    


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.  And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?  I don't know, but here's a scary graph.  So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.  Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.  Not significantly.  After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.  So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.  Doesn't seem like much.  But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.  I went down another rabbit hole.  1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?  The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.  Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.  Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).  It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.  After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.  And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.  When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?  A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.  But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.  

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.  Short the S&P there.  


Or you could just go to the source, nevermind, retail traders can't get any accurate, up to date, actionable market data.  You can go to the fed, but it's 3 days late.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

**This week's things to watch for:**

  
Tomorrow we also get the results from the Richmond manufacturing index and Consumer confidence.  

Last week, the Empire Index was up (barely) though the prices paid were higher (higher inflation).  The Philly index was down, and prices paid were at 40 year highs.  Tomorrow is Richmond.  Where the fuck is Richmond?  Thursday is unemployment claims, and Friday is another print of CPI.  But it's on a holiday weekend.  So responses should be muted.  If bad, look for a bloody Tuesday.  If good, fuck it, why not?  All time highs again.

In short, no.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

my god..

and also they retain the voting rights?! i want out but i dont know who else allows buying of gme and amc... i had a stake account but they stopped letting people buy shares back in January and that's when i got into selfwealth and have been ever since but finding this out today is quiet frightening..

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME –  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.  These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",nkk4c1,where to buy GME stocks in Australia?! SelfWealth is evil and stake was dodgy!

you can legally yolo all your money into a horrible option, and you can become a homeless person or billionaire at any given time. What is the difference between these 2 groups, well to me it is structure.

&#x200B;

You may be saying, 'well I have my trading system so I am good right?', no - you are not. You are missing 50% of the equation. Hear me out:

&#x200B;

A trading STRUCTURE is what should house, or literally be the roof and foundation for your SYSTEM. Imagine a trading system being a furnace, it cannot keep you warm and safe without a roof, walls, and foundation. So, what is my structure and system; here ya go:

&#x200B;

Trading Structure (Literal Home):

**Foundation**: Risk Management - All decisions, all other elements, and all trades are GROUNDED in risk management. I get it, 'Apes Stick Together' or whatever, but I use stop losses - I enter every trade with a set loss and take profit. I do not get emotional, I have a plan, and each trade is a 3 reward to 1 risk setup at least for a small move.

**Walls**: I base my 4 balls of success on:

1. 3 Analysis: 
   1. **Fundamental Analysis** based on news, P/E Ratio, Floats, EPS, etc. 
   2. **Technical Analysis** based on charts, graphs, value. If you are one of those 'AsTrOlOgY fOr IdIoTs' people, fine but understand you are handicapping yourself due to your own ego.
   3. **Mental Analysis** based on confidence, execution, and planning.
2. **Macro Economic** moves like inflation rates, money supply, consumer confidence; and Indexes like S&P, Nasdaq, DOW30, Russell2000, etc. I also study the 11 sectors intently too.
3. **Trading Plan** that includes a stop loss, a loading or buying zone, a price target, and an exit strategy and entry strategy already planned.
4. **Goal Setting** for my 1 month, 6 month, 1 year, 5 year, etc.... and what each trade does to help these goals.

From there my '**ROOF**' or my added protection is consistency. I stick to these rules. Before every trade, I double check with my 'roof' that I am being consistent. When I am in a trade, I check to make sure I am being consistent. When I exit - guess what, I check I am being consistent.

There will be some nights we would all enjoy and actually benefit from not having a roof. Those 73 degree, sunny days come - and we may enjoy sleeping in a tent or even sleeping with the sound of toad ribbits and cricket songs, and we give that up. We do because there are also hurricane level monsoons and without a roof, your whole room will be ruined (blowing up your account).

&#x200B;

From there, you place your SYSTEM in this STRUCTURE. Scalping, great. Day trader, beautiful. Swing, long term, only ETF, dividends!? That is fine. Anytime frame, any short term goal, and account size; all of the things that make your TRADING EDGE or SYSTEM goes into the STRUCUTRE.

&#x200B;

Please have both. Please have rules. Please understand you are in a chaotic neutral system, with 0 rules, 0 guidance, 0 anything. You either create your own structure, or have none. You fail to plan, than you're planning to fail. Good luck.",nkq9et,The Difference Between A Trading Structure And A Trading System

I want to call attention to the fact that GME has been consolidating for 2 months and looks just about ready to launch. Check the chart below courtesy of traderstewie. For months GME has been tightening and building higher lows on the daily and weekly. The key level to break out of the wedge is \~190 which we're pretty much exactly at now. Above $190 the path looks open to $300+.

**What I'm saying my friends is that GME is starting to look like a rocket launch site.**

The only thing missing is VOLUME. SPCE & TSLA look interesting but what we're seeing in GME is 5-star. Think maybe it's time we get the band back together.

Not advice, I just like the stock. Do you?

*As always, do your own due diligence. Knowing how to read charts can make you slightly more likely to catch break outs and mitigate losses but there is always uncertainty. Don't speculate with $ you can't afford to lose.*

Thus, the banks would no longer operate illegal and unlawful financing should they offer loans and other services to the companies. That would be a huge step in removing what analysts are calling an obstacle to the development of a national cannabis industry.

Legislators voted for the bill with 321-101 votes and sent it to the Senate.

https://preview.redd.it/5mpqdo4tja171.jpg?width=660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1255ec4f5a2471772ca27ad86ea25c16167d241b

The bill clarifies that proceeds from legal cannabis deals are not considered illegal and instructs federal regulators to create rules on how they would oversee such banking activities. Banks have so far been unwilling to do business with companies that sell marijuana or related products, fearing they could run into conflict with US federal law. This has left marijuana companies with few options to rely on a handful of small financial institutions or do cash deals. The American Bankers Association has aggressively lobbied for the SAFE Banking Act bill.

The banks have been in a difficult position due to the conflict between state and federal law, so it makes sense that Congress must act now to resolve this conflict. Thirty-six US states have now legalized medical cannabis, while 17 states already allow recreational use of cannabis by adults.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would try to push legislation. The positive reaction of the stock prices of Tilray, Sundial Growers, Aphria or Aurora Cannabis shows the great relief of investors. Investors hope that this could have kicked off further progressive reforms in the cannabis sector. This move took the potential of a game-changing marijuana law an important step forward.

If Congress passes the SAFE Banking Act and President Joe Biden signs it, it would likely become much easier and cheaper for marijuana companies to raise the capital they need to fund their growth initiatives. The law should also make cannabis companies safer and more efficient, as credit services would reduce the need for cash in day-to-day operations.

Currently the stock is down 15-20% from the opening bell. Who cares? Nobody is fever-buying IPOs like they were late last year or early this year. But this is actually the perfect time to buy in. Why? Well this IPO is actually occurring exactly when YouTube is just about to fuck over all of the business YouTube accounts in the USA.

What is YouTube doing to fuck over businesses? Well they are starting to run ads on non-partnered content. See source here, from the November terms of use update: [https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719)

If you don't want to read this, basically it says that channels that aren't partners are now going to get ads on their videos and YouTube is keeping ALL of the revenue (fuck you, right?). I've personally already witnessed this because I manage YT channels for several businesses and I've already gotten ads. And guess who gets a call every time their client sees an ad on their videos? Me, I get the call. 

&#x200B;

**When does this happen?**

It's already started. I've started seeing ads on corporate non-monetized and uncopyrighted videos within the last couple weeks, but the change is supposed to be implemented across the country in June. I've already been getting calls from my boss and from clients. We are already moving a lot of content to Vimeo.

&#x200B;

**Why does this matter?** 

Businesses are not going to be happy if their competitors are running ads on their videos. Especially if that ad occurs when the video is embedded on their own website. I know for a fact that ads are showing in YouTube but there has been no distinction that I'm aware of that would prohibit them from running ads in embedded videos on a website or blog. 

&#x200B;

**What is going to happen?**

If businesses start seeing competitor ads on their videos, they will do everything they can to stop it. They can either join the YPP and disable ads or they can leave the platform. However, there are requirements to the YPP:

1. They must have 1,000 subscribers
2. They must have 4,000 watch hours in the last 12 months

I can promise you that most businesses do not even come close to meeting these requirements. They can try to purchase subscribers or views but YouTube is good at identifying this. Trust me, I've gone down that road and have seen channels get taken down because of it.

&#x200B;

**Why is VMEO the best play here?**

The main reason is because businesses will leave YouTube.

Vimeo is hand-down my favorite video hosting service for a few reasons:

* The video encode quality is visibly better
* The embedded player is 100% customizable
* It's easier to pick thumbnails
* It has a built-in review system for businesses
* And the best feature, you can update videos without changing the URL (very helpful for embedding)

What's the drawback? It costs $7/month for most of these features. But businesses will gladly pay that to not have their competitors on their website/videos.

RBLX has been on a bull run for past week and more. I wanted to to highlight few critical points here.

RBLX is approaching its resistance, Bearish in short term.  
It might fight $90 for 1 or 2 days, and then retrace to 21 ema (must be close to the ascending support line around $72) Wise decision would be to close a position now and re-enter at a lower price.  
Another data point to be cautions, analysts 12 month high price target - $90.

It started when I had the prophetic revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector. And because increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I stopped smoking weed.  My first thought was that if the government doesn’t release the report then I’m fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report sometime in June. However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it’s another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  After every national emergency, such as saying this is foreign tech would be, it has caused defense contract stocks to go up 5-10%. Also many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.

GME has been consolidating between the bag holders of the first and second peaks. As you can see, on average, nobody is bag holding now. This is good sign for bulls. I would expect a retest of the 195/200 range. If that holds, it's game on.

If we really need to get this longer then why don't I explain the significance of VWAP. It stands for volume weighted average price. It basically shows the price normalized by the volumes of buyers and sellers that have bought/sold in the past. Why is this important? It's important because it more accurately indicates where there are zones of overhead supply (bag holders waiting to sell once they break even) or pent up demand (most holders are feeling good and waiting to buy dips). In this case, price has been stuck between the psychology of two market participants; the bag holders and the (not?) bag holders. Now that price is above both VWAP levels, more market participants are ITM than not ITM. This means less selling pressure. This means moon.",nkz1y6,GME Anchored VWAP

Hello Hivemind,

From a fundamentalist and technical analysis perspective, I predict with a high degree of certainty that there will be strong price action coming within the next month, and I believe it'll be upward momentum. Here's why:

Fundamentally.  
\-Earnings are in a month. Here we may have another chance at the possibility of seeing the FB settlement or selling of Huwaei patents  
\-Earnings should beat last quarter. I promise you this hack on Colonial pipeline puckered a lot of businesses anuses and companies must all be looking at the best possible ways to increase their end-to-end security, also the shoutout from the hacker Darkside recommending Cyclance (IF the texts were real) is bigger than you think. Also, those of you who are invested and or bag holding should have also subscribed to Cyclance for $29, every one of those subscriptions helps their bottom line.  
\-Increase in advertisements. A lot more sponsored ads coming up on Reddit, Twitter, and also in other forms from Blackberry.  
\-No publicity is bad publicity. We still get connected with Jim Cramer's ""Reddit Stocks"" list on TV, but our price action never moves that drastically in comparison to the S&P 500. I have no doubt in my mind those who actually do their research, follow the price action, and the news from this company they'll see what treasure lies in store, but they could be looking for a better entry price. Currently, the average price target from CNN is $8.76 and $BB is very close as of writing at $8.60. Analyst projections going from $4.60 to $20. Following analyst's opinions are not always a great indicator, but this helps my prediction that there will be some turbulence will be coming soon, up or down.  
\-Massive institutional investment. I cannot stress this enough. Go on Fintel.io and you'll see recent additions to their portfolios from names like:  
\-Citadel. Bought 1,400,000 shares this quarter. Net Long on calls and puts  
\-Great West Life Assurance - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of New York - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of Montreal - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Many others, such as PrimeCap, Fidelity, and Vanguard  
Institutions are getting in, and heavily. there is a possibility that the price was beaten or manipulated down so institutions may enter at a cheap price but that's a different conversation, this is a conversation about $BB and the large chance of a movement, not manipulation.

From this picture, we can see how the Bollinger bands are tightening up immensely, and we are about to see a triple cross of the 20/50/200 DMA. Both of these are signals of a large movement in price and if institutions are getting in so recently I couldn't imagine it's going to tank much further.  
An interesting note to make is how nicely the candles follow the Bollinger bands up and down, as well as when they touch the 50/200 DMA. Once the two cross that'll be either our death or golden cross. Hard to say which way, but I'd suggest it's up with all these companies are increasing their portfolio of $BB by 30%+.

This is the reason why I believe this is the signal. Call it apophenia if you aren't into TA but it can be an incredible tool for establishing share price.

This chart shows the significance of \~$8.60 from history going back to April 2017 on the farthest left. The green dotted line shows how many times it acted as support but as well as resistance.  
This makes our current price range very strong because of how many times BB has touched \~$8.60. There have been times where it has tested below but eventually it has propped itself back up so far every time. It acted as resistance during the first stage of the WSB rally in January, came back down, and that was the signal to the upside.  
The next signal to the upside is \~$14.51 because of the yellow line. That was resistance during the WSB rally in which the daily candle spiked up and as well as acted at resistance on Jan 18 and as well after the crash.  
If $BB breaks \~$14.51 and secures it, $BB may go parabolic again.

But what if it goes down?  
The next support line below \~$8.60 is \~$6.50. But that probably won't happen because of $BB's Enterprise value. As of writing based the enterprise value is $4.98B and in comparison, our market cap is $4.81B, which puts BB's enterprise value and market cap very close in line with each other.

Final notes:  
I believe with a very high degree of confidence that $BB is going to move up now and we've reached very close to the bottom. I understand that it is impossible to predict the market but with these tools, research, my personal understanding of the market and its psychology involved, I think that $BB is primed and the uptrend may begin.

I am not your financial advisor. I am not a professional. I am only a mere student of the game which is life and the market.

I hold 2000 shares of BB and will be adding upon confirmation of the upside.

After a day of small losses it makes you feel pretty shitty and you wish you could have gains and be the true high iq investor you believe you are and seeing a red number on your screen makes you depressed and since you’re too poor to be an alcoholic you have to find a different way to avoid this depression. This is where Wall Street bets comes in. 

You log on and find a group of autist who would make 10x more money if they smashed a keyboard with their head repeatedly till a order went through, but they aren’t smart enough to do so and they also don’t have the brain capacity to understand risk management so this results in heaps of loss porn which makes your depression go away and makes you more confident in your intelligence.

But this isn’t because people are naturally this retarded, if they were they wouldn’t have a brokerage account, that’s where the magic of Wall Street bets shines. A already stupid degenerate with a brokerage accidentally stumbled upon this Reddit and decided to scroll and laugh and ultimately slowly lose brain cells, this goes on and on till they lose so many brain cells that they put all their life savings into a shitty stock because BALLSEATER99 told them it has to go up. They then lose their life savings and post loss porn and leave to never be seen again but for each retard that losses their life savings 2 replaces them.

My hypothesis is that they are pushing for forbearance to end, resulting in a massive wave of evictions and foreclosures,  forcing g homeowners into the rental market. This will also drop prices so they leverage positive cash flow into buying even more real estate.

Ford’s plan to invest in EVs and self-driving cars rose to $29 billion, including $22 billion for EVs through 2025. 

Ford and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL are entering a six-year deal that will make the tech giant responsible for much of Ford’s growing in-vehicle connectivity. This partnership is designed to streamline Ford’s operations and accelerate an ongoing $11 billion restructuring plan. 

General Motors:

General Motors announced that it plans to invest $27 billion in EV and autonomous vehicles through 2025. The company also mentioned that it plans to release 30 EV models globally by 2025.

The company has partnered with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT in leading a $2 billion investment round in self-driving car startup Cruise LLC.

Difference:
Ford is going with Google and General Motors is going with Microsoft. 

Google has 14 Automotive startup investments and Acquisitions.

Microsoft only has investments in 4 automotive startups.

This will help Ford and General Motors in the following areas:

- Autonomous driving technology.
- Connected car tech & fleet management.
- Electric vehicle technology.
- Automotive retail.
- Mobility-as-a-service & shared mobility.

Who wins?
In this situation Ford has the better outlook, Google with 14 different Automotive startups to do its project development for Ford, also Google has access to Android and will give Ford the ability to integrate mobile connectivity to their cars.

I will keep buying Ford, because of the potential technology integration.

They're a good source of protein, environmentally friendly, they're crunchy, you can make bread with them, and cockroaches are fuckin sturdy.  Nuclear war?  No problem.  The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.  That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.  

And then the fuckin cicadas came.  Not a problem, right?  That happens reliably on 17 year cycles, should be priced in.  Except that they came *early*.  Nobody's talking about this but everyone in the cockroach community knows.  The rats have been feasting on these things.  It only takes them three weeks to breed.  And since the rat population is already booming, you retards can do the math.  Oh christ, they're going to be everywhere.  I already see them lurking in the grass.  We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  

You know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.  My wife and my wife's boyfriend left me at this point because I had not a penny to my name.  And you'd think they'd deliver 'em dead, right?  Nope!  Now I have literal tons of cockroaches crawling around my house and as a bonus they're attracting more rats cause apparently I'm not the only one who thinks they're a good source of protein.  And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.  

tl;dr I'm broke, I'm starving, my house is gone, and I'm probably gonna get eaten by rats.  Never, ever buy cockroach futures.",nk4z03,I am financially ruined and my life is hell thanks to cockroach futures

9276,,2021-05-24 18:49:18,t3_nk56mr,,wallstreetbets,"So for those of you who aren't nerds that pay attention to military procurement and DoD fuckery, you might've missed the fact that the DoD is considering shelving the entire 10-billion dollar JEDI contract for the simple fact that the bidders are having an all out legal battle to see who deserves the contract. 

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn’t brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD’s Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> “While all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we’re risking is just different stovepipes,” Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. “**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**” 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM’s Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 6 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is just about over, so there is a good chance that this is going to be the final spreadsheet until Q2 rolls around. Thank you all for joining me for the ride!

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It’s an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What’s not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they’re one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I’ve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I’d love to see what you guys come up with.

9286,,2021-05-24 19:42:47,t3_nk6fnw,,wallstreetbets,"Well, the commodity market has been on fire. The question is... is that gonna continue? 
While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and copper for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc) 
I am long on TRQ .",nk6fnw,$TRQ and the Copper/Gold play

It seems to me that this is an important market indicator - if the CEO of a large company sells most of his stock or buys more, this indirectly determines the company's performance and the mood of employees. Of course, insider trading based on non-public information is illegal. However, when the company's employees buy or sell its shares in large quantities, it is completely legal and an important indicator of its affairs.

**1.** [$ATSG](https://contora.ai/ticker/atsg) **(Air Transport Services Group)**

I will post the second list with the top 5 companies by insider selling activity later in a separate post, if you like this topic.

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Their next earnings are slated for 6/10/21 after market close.

I don't know if this next line is necessary or not but just to be safe....I'm not a professional financial advisor and this is not investment advice.",nk79sh,$CHWY - Earnings coming up - huge upside potential

 If my calls expire in the money then I'll make about a $300 profit for a total $545 profit in just one month. Then I'll just sell some cash covered puts then rinse and repeat. If the calls expire OTM then it's another monthly covered calls. I truly believe in BNGO which is why I have about 200 other calls on the side for the long term.

The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don’t think it holds up with Zillow. I know their software is great for their agents on the backend, but not into it as a consumer. Overall I like it as a long-term play.

9312,,2021-05-25 02:00:02,t3_nkedem,,wallstreetbets,"I want to preface this by saying that I’m primarily a value investor (although many of my clients do own growth stocks) so my area of expertise isn’t necessarily on growth stocks like PENN. With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can’t necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what’s to come. So, let’s take a look at PENN’s growth. 

In 2015 Penn’s revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN’s revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN’s debt to asset ratio of 80% isn’t terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN’s partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

Thanks for reading this. If you liked my analysis and are curious about a company’s value, feel free to let me know.",nkedem,Should you bet on PENN?

What people aren't realizing is that RSUs converted today and all insiders automatically had a portion of their RSUs sold in order to cover the taxes.

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,The PLUG Restatement: A Great Chance to Get Out

Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.  There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".  The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.  Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.  In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.  In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.    


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.  While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?  Good question.  I don't know yet.  Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.  Another good question.  I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?  The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.  They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.  This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.  *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**    


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.  And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?  I don't know, but here's a scary graph.  So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.  Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.  Not significantly.  After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.  So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.  Doesn't seem like much.  But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.  I went down another rabbit hole.  1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?  The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.  Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.  Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).  It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.  After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.  And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.  When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?  A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.  But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.  

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.  Short the S&P there.  


Or you could just go to the source, nevermind, retail traders can't get any accurate, up to date, actionable market data.  You can go to the fed, but it's 3 days late.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

**This week's things to watch for:**

  
Tomorrow we also get the results from the Richmond manufacturing index and Consumer confidence.  

Last week, the Empire Index was up (barely) though the prices paid were higher (higher inflation).  The Philly index was down, and prices paid were at 40 year highs.  Tomorrow is Richmond.  Where the fuck is Richmond?  Thursday is unemployment claims, and Friday is another print of CPI.  But it's on a holiday weekend.  So responses should be muted.  If bad, look for a bloody Tuesday.  If good, fuck it, why not?  All time highs again.

In short, no.

SelfWealth members have been allowed to buy and sell GME as  well as others like AMC, throughout the entirety of 2021. This is in  stark comparison to other platforms that entirely halted the trading of  certain stocks.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

my god..

and also they retain the voting rights?! i want out but i dont know who else allows buying of gme and amc... i had a stake account but they stopped letting people buy shares back in January and that's when i got into selfwealth and have been ever since but finding this out today is quiet frightening..

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME –  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.  These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",nkk4c1,where to buy GME stocks in Australia?! SelfWealth is evil and stake was dodgy!

You may be saying, 'well I have my trading system so I am good right?', no - you are not. You are missing 50% of the equation. Hear me out:

&#x200B;

Trading Structure (Literal Home):

**Foundation**: Risk Management - All decisions, all other elements, and all trades are GROUNDED in risk management. I get it, 'Apes Stick Together' or whatever, but I use stop losses - I enter every trade with a set loss and take profit. I do not get emotional, I have a plan, and each trade is a 3 reward to 1 risk setup at least for a small move.

**Walls**: I base my 4 balls of success on:

1. 3 Analysis: 
   1. **Fundamental Analysis** based on news, P/E Ratio, Floats, EPS, etc. 
   2. **Technical Analysis** based on charts, graphs, value. If you are one of those 'AsTrOlOgY fOr IdIoTs' people, fine but understand you are handicapping yourself due to your own ego.
   3. **Mental Analysis** based on confidence, execution, and planning.
2. **Macro Economic** moves like inflation rates, money supply, consumer confidence; and Indexes like S&P, Nasdaq, DOW30, Russell2000, etc. I also study the 11 sectors intently too.
3. **Trading Plan** that includes a stop loss, a loading or buying zone, a price target, and an exit strategy and entry strategy already planned.
4. **Goal Setting** for my 1 month, 6 month, 1 year, 5 year, etc.... and what each trade does to help these goals.

From there my '**ROOF**' or my added protection is consistency. I stick to these rules. Before every trade, I double check with my 'roof' that I am being consistent. When I am in a trade, I check to make sure I am being consistent. When I exit - guess what, I check I am being consistent.

There will be some nights we would all enjoy and actually benefit from not having a roof. Those 73 degree, sunny days come - and we may enjoy sleeping in a tent or even sleeping with the sound of toad ribbits and cricket songs, and we give that up. We do because there are also hurricane level monsoons and without a roof, your whole room will be ruined (blowing up your account).

From there, you place your SYSTEM in this STRUCTURE. Scalping, great. Day trader, beautiful. Swing, long term, only ETF, dividends!? That is fine. Anytime frame, any short term goal, and account size; all of the things that make your TRADING EDGE or SYSTEM goes into the STRUCUTRE.

I want to call attention to the fact that GME has been consolidating for 2 months and looks just about ready to launch. Check the chart below courtesy of traderstewie. For months GME has been tightening and building higher lows on the daily and weekly. The key level to break out of the wedge is \~190 which we're pretty much exactly at now. Above $190 the path looks open to $300+.

**What I'm saying my friends is that GME is starting to look like a rocket launch site.**

The only thing missing is VOLUME. SPCE & TSLA look interesting but what we're seeing in GME is 5-star. Think maybe it's time we get the band back together.

Not advice, I just like the stock. Do you?

Thus, the banks would no longer operate illegal and unlawful financing should they offer loans and other services to the companies. That would be a huge step in removing what analysts are calling an obstacle to the development of a national cannabis industry.

Legislators voted for the bill with 321-101 votes and sent it to the Senate.

https://preview.redd.it/5mpqdo4tja171.jpg?width=660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1255ec4f5a2471772ca27ad86ea25c16167d241b

The bill clarifies that proceeds from legal cannabis deals are not considered illegal and instructs federal regulators to create rules on how they would oversee such banking activities. Banks have so far been unwilling to do business with companies that sell marijuana or related products, fearing they could run into conflict with US federal law. This has left marijuana companies with few options to rely on a handful of small financial institutions or do cash deals. The American Bankers Association has aggressively lobbied for the SAFE Banking Act bill.

The banks have been in a difficult position due to the conflict between state and federal law, so it makes sense that Congress must act now to resolve this conflict. Thirty-six US states have now legalized medical cannabis, while 17 states already allow recreational use of cannabis by adults.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would try to push legislation. The positive reaction of the stock prices of Tilray, Sundial Growers, Aphria or Aurora Cannabis shows the great relief of investors. Investors hope that this could have kicked off further progressive reforms in the cannabis sector. This move took the potential of a game-changing marijuana law an important step forward.

If Congress passes the SAFE Banking Act and President Joe Biden signs it, it would likely become much easier and cheaper for marijuana companies to raise the capital they need to fund their growth initiatives. The law should also make cannabis companies safer and more efficient, as credit services would reduce the need for cash in day-to-day operations.

Currently the stock is down 15-20% from the opening bell. Who cares? Nobody is fever-buying IPOs like they were late last year or early this year. But this is actually the perfect time to buy in. Why? Well this IPO is actually occurring exactly when YouTube is just about to fuck over all of the business YouTube accounts in the USA.

What is YouTube doing to fuck over businesses? Well they are starting to run ads on non-partnered content. See source here, from the November terms of use update: [https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719)

If you don't want to read this, basically it says that channels that aren't partners are now going to get ads on their videos and YouTube is keeping ALL of the revenue (fuck you, right?). I've personally already witnessed this because I manage YT channels for several businesses and I've already gotten ads. And guess who gets a call every time their client sees an ad on their videos? Me, I get the call. 

&#x200B;

**When does this happen?**

It's already started. I've started seeing ads on corporate non-monetized and uncopyrighted videos within the last couple weeks, but the change is supposed to be implemented across the country in June. I've already been getting calls from my boss and from clients. We are already moving a lot of content to Vimeo.

&#x200B;

**Why does this matter?** 

Businesses are not going to be happy if their competitors are running ads on their videos. Especially if that ad occurs when the video is embedded on their own website. I know for a fact that ads are showing in YouTube but there has been no distinction that I'm aware of that would prohibit them from running ads in embedded videos on a website or blog. 

&#x200B;

**What is going to happen?**

If businesses start seeing competitor ads on their videos, they will do everything they can to stop it. They can either join the YPP and disable ads or they can leave the platform. However, there are requirements to the YPP:

1. They must have 1,000 subscribers
2. They must have 4,000 watch hours in the last 12 months

I can promise you that most businesses do not even come close to meeting these requirements. They can try to purchase subscribers or views but YouTube is good at identifying this. Trust me, I've gone down that road and have seen channels get taken down because of it.

&#x200B;

**Why is VMEO the best play here?**

The main reason is because businesses will leave YouTube.

Vimeo is hand-down my favorite video hosting service for a few reasons:

* The video encode quality is visibly better
* The embedded player is 100% customizable
* It's easier to pick thumbnails
* It has a built-in review system for businesses
* And the best feature, you can update videos without changing the URL (very helpful for embedding)

What's the drawback? It costs $7/month for most of these features. But businesses will gladly pay that to not have their competitors on their website/videos.

RBLX has been on a bull run for past week and more. I wanted to to highlight few critical points here.

RBLX is approaching its resistance, Bearish in short term.  
It might fight $90 for 1 or 2 days, and then retrace to 21 ema (must be close to the ascending support line around $72) Wise decision would be to close a position now and re-enter at a lower price.  
Another data point to be cautions, analysts 12 month high price target - $90.

It started when I had the prophetic revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector. And because increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I stopped smoking weed.  My first thought was that if the government doesn’t release the report then I’m fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report sometime in June. However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it’s another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  After every national emergency, such as saying this is foreign tech would be, it has caused defense contract stocks to go up 5-10%. Also many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.  Finally I looked up ufo on google trends today and it is up 3x its 12 month average.  Google trends have been shown to foresee increase in prices.

GME has been consolidating between the bag holders of the first and second peaks. As you can see, on average, nobody is bag holding now. This is good sign for bulls. I would expect a retest of the 195/200 range. If that holds, it's game on.

If we really need to get this longer then why don't I explain the significance of VWAP. It stands for volume weighted average price. It basically shows the price normalized by the volumes of buyers and sellers that have bought/sold in the past. Why is this important? It's important because it more accurately indicates where there are zones of overhead supply (bag holders waiting to sell once they break even) or pent up demand (most holders are feeling good and waiting to buy dips). In this case, price has been stuck between the psychology of two market participants; the bag holders and the (not?) bag holders. Now that price is above both VWAP levels, more market participants are ITM than not ITM. This means less selling pressure. This means moon.",nkz1y6,GME Anchored VWAP

Hello Hivemind,

From a fundamentalist and technical analysis perspective, I predict with a high degree of certainty that there will be strong price action coming within the next month, and I believe it'll be upward momentum. Here's why:

Fundamentally.  
\-Earnings are in a month. Here we may have another chance at the possibility of seeing the FB settlement or selling of Huwaei patents  
\-Earnings should beat last quarter. I promise you this hack on Colonial pipeline puckered a lot of businesses anuses and companies must all be looking at the best possible ways to increase their end-to-end security, also the shoutout from the hacker Darkside recommending Cyclance (IF the texts were real) is bigger than you think. Also, those of you who are invested and or bag holding should have also subscribed to Cyclance for $29, every one of those subscriptions helps their bottom line.  
\-Increase in advertisements. A lot more sponsored ads coming up on Reddit, Twitter, and also in other forms from Blackberry.  
\-No publicity is bad publicity. We still get connected with Jim Cramer's ""Reddit Stocks"" list on TV, but our price action never moves that drastically in comparison to the S&P 500. I have no doubt in my mind those who actually do their research, follow the price action, and the news from this company they'll see what treasure lies in store, but they could be looking for a better entry price. Currently, the average price target from CNN is $8.76 and $BB is very close as of writing at $8.60. Analyst projections going from $4.60 to $20. Following analyst's opinions are not always a great indicator, but this helps my prediction that there will be some turbulence will be coming soon, up or down.  
\-Massive institutional investment. I cannot stress this enough. Go on Fintel.io and you'll see recent additions to their portfolios from names like:  
\-Citadel. Bought 1,400,000 shares this quarter. Net Long on calls and puts  
\-Great West Life Assurance - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of New York - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of Montreal - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Many others, such as PrimeCap, Fidelity, and Vanguard  
Institutions are getting in, and heavily. there is a possibility that the price was beaten or manipulated down so institutions may enter at a cheap price but that's a different conversation, this is a conversation about $BB and the large chance of a movement, not manipulation.

Technical analysis.

&#x200B;

From this picture, we can see how the Bollinger bands are tightening up immensely, and we are about to see a triple cross of the 20/50/200 DMA. Both of these are signals of a large movement in price and if institutions are getting in so recently I couldn't imagine it's going to tank much further.  
An interesting note to make is how nicely the candles follow the Bollinger bands up and down, as well as when they touch the 50/200 DMA. Once the two cross that'll be either our death or golden cross. Hard to say which way, but I'd suggest it's up with all these companies are increasing their portfolio of $BB by 30%+.

This chart shows the significance of \~$8.60 from history going back to April 2017 on the farthest left. The green dotted line shows how many times it acted as support but as well as resistance.  
This makes our current price range very strong because of how many times BB has touched \~$8.60. There have been times where it has tested below but eventually it has propped itself back up so far every time. It acted as resistance during the first stage of the WSB rally in January, came back down, and that was the signal to the upside.  
The next signal to the upside is \~$14.51 because of the yellow line. That was resistance during the WSB rally in which the daily candle spiked up and as well as acted at resistance on Jan 18 and as well after the crash.  
If $BB breaks \~$14.51 and secures it, $BB may go parabolic again.

But what if it goes down?  
The next support line below \~$8.60 is \~$6.50. But that probably won't happen because of $BB's Enterprise value. As of writing based the enterprise value is $4.98B and in comparison, our market cap is $4.81B, which puts BB's enterprise value and market cap very close in line with each other.

Final notes:  
I believe with a very high degree of confidence that $BB is going to move up now and we've reached very close to the bottom. I understand that it is impossible to predict the market but with these tools, research, my personal understanding of the market and its psychology involved, I think that $BB is primed and the uptrend may begin.

I am not your financial advisor. I am not a professional. I am only a mere student of the game which is life and the market.

I hold 2000 shares of BB and will be adding upon confirmation of the upside.

Please comment below on anything else you believe should be added to this if you have any additional insight to bring forward and I'll certainly edit it in.",nkza6a,$BB - Expect Large Movements WithIn 1 Month.

After a day of small losses it makes you feel pretty shitty and you wish you could have gains and be the true high iq investor you believe you are and seeing a red number on your screen makes you depressed and since you’re too poor to be an alcoholic you have to find a different way to avoid this depression. This is where Wall Street bets comes in. 

You log on and find a group of autist who would make 10x more money if they smashed a keyboard with their head repeatedly till a order went through, but they aren’t smart enough to do so and they also don’t have the brain capacity to understand risk management so this results in heaps of loss porn which makes your depression go away and makes you more confident in your intelligence.

But this isn’t because people are naturally this retarded, if they were they wouldn’t have a brokerage account, that’s where the magic of Wall Street bets shines. A already stupid degenerate with a brokerage accidentally stumbled upon this Reddit and decided to scroll and laugh and ultimately slowly lose brain cells, this goes on and on till they lose so many brain cells that they put all their life savings into a shitty stock because BALLSEATER99 told them it has to go up. They then lose their life savings and post loss porn and leave to never be seen again but for each retard that losses their life savings 2 replaces them.

This entire sub is just a loss porn farm.",nkzhf9,If your on this sub to make money then leave

My hypothesis is that they are pushing for forbearance to end, resulting in a massive wave of evictions and foreclosures,  forcing g homeowners into the rental market. This will also drop prices so they leverage positive cash flow into buying even more real estate.

Ford’s plan to invest in EVs and self-driving cars rose to $29 billion, including $22 billion for EVs through 2025. 

Ford and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL are entering a six-year deal that will make the tech giant responsible for much of Ford’s growing in-vehicle connectivity. This partnership is designed to streamline Ford’s operations and accelerate an ongoing $11 billion restructuring plan. 

General Motors:

General Motors announced that it plans to invest $27 billion in EV and autonomous vehicles through 2025. The company also mentioned that it plans to release 30 EV models globally by 2025.

The company has partnered with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT in leading a $2 billion investment round in self-driving car startup Cruise LLC.

Difference:
Ford is going with Google and General Motors is going with Microsoft. 

Google has 14 Automotive startup investments and Acquisitions.

Microsoft only has investments in 4 automotive startups.

This will help Ford and General Motors in the following areas:

- Autonomous driving technology.
- Connected car tech & fleet management.
- Electric vehicle technology.
- Automotive retail.
- Mobility-as-a-service & shared mobility.

Who wins?
In this situation Ford has the better outlook, Google with 14 different Automotive startups to do its project development for Ford, also Google has access to Android and will give Ford the ability to integrate mobile connectivity to their cars.

I will keep buying Ford, because of the potential technology integration.

So in reality, this stock isn't really shorted too much at all. At the end of the day, I'm not too concerned about what the short percentage might be. I'm primarily focused on the strength of PUBM financial condition. For the motivation of the short sellers, there's a lot of speculation about the future of the digital ad market with the coming privacy changes, but management seems to have a good handle on it. It blows my mind why retail investors get the idea that they know the digital ad market better than an entire management team running a billion dollar+ adtech company, but to each their own of course. Short sellers probably sold short due to IDFA changes in iOS, chrome cookie change, bloated valuation , and the lockup period expiration. The short borrow rate has been ticking higher though, so they are definitely being aggressive with their short sales. At the end of the day, what I see is a highly profitable company, growing at a nice rate, a strong management team, and a growth industry. Good long term hold in my book, but you are rolling the dice as even Google will admit that no one really knows what will happen when the third party cookie goes away.

They're a good source of protein, environmentally friendly, they're crunchy, you can make bread with them, and cockroaches are fuckin sturdy.  Nuclear war?  No problem.  The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.  That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.  

And then the fuckin cicadas came.  Not a problem, right?  That happens reliably on 17 year cycles, should be priced in.  Except that they came *early*.  Nobody's talking about this but everyone in the cockroach community knows.  The rats have been feasting on these things.  It only takes them three weeks to breed.  And since the rat population is already booming, you retards can do the math.  Oh christ, they're going to be everywhere.  I already see them lurking in the grass.  We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  

You know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.  My wife and my wife's boyfriend left me at this point because I had not a penny to my name.  And you'd think they'd deliver 'em dead, right?  Nope!  Now I have literal tons of cockroaches crawling around my house and as a bonus they're attracting more rats cause apparently I'm not the only one who thinks they're a good source of protein.  And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.  

tl;dr I'm broke, I'm starving, my house is gone, and I'm probably gonna get eaten by rats.  Never, ever buy cockroach futures.",nk4z03,I am financially ruined and my life is hell thanks to cockroach futures

9781,,2021-05-24 18:49:18,t3_nk56mr,,wallstreetbets,"So for those of you who aren't nerds that pay attention to military procurement and DoD fuckery, you might've missed the fact that the DoD is considering shelving the entire 10-billion dollar JEDI contract for the simple fact that the bidders are having an all out legal battle to see who deserves the contract. 

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn’t brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD’s Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> “While all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we’re risking is just different stovepipes,” Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. “**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**” 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM’s Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is just about over, so there is a good chance that this is going to be the final spreadsheet until Q2 rolls around. Thank you all for joining me for the ride!

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It’s an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What’s not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they’re one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing)

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I’ve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I’d love to see what you guys come up with.

9791,,2021-05-24 19:42:47,t3_nk6fnw,,wallstreetbets,"Well, the commodity market has been on fire. The question is... is that gonna continue? 
While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and copper for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc) 
I am long on TRQ .",nk6fnw,$TRQ and the Copper/Gold play

Of course, insider trading based on non-public information is illegal. However, when the company's employees buy or sell its shares in large quantities, it is completely legal and an important indicator of its affairs.

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Their next earnings are slated for 6/10/21 after market close.

The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don’t think it holds up with Zillow. I know their software is great for their agents on the backend, but not into it as a consumer. Overall I like it as a long-term play.

9817,,2021-05-25 02:00:02,t3_nkedem,,wallstreetbets,"I want to preface this by saying that I’m primarily a value investor (although many of my clients do own growth stocks) so my area of expertise isn’t necessarily on growth stocks like PENN. With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can’t necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what’s to come. So, let’s take a look at PENN’s growth. 

In 2015 Penn’s revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN’s revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN’s debt to asset ratio of 80% isn’t terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN’s partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,The PLUG Restatement: A Great Chance to Get Out

Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.  There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".  The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.  Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.  In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.  In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.    


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.  While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?  Good question.  I don't know yet.  Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.  Another good question.  I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?  The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.  They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.  This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.  *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**    


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.  And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?  I don't know, but here's a scary graph.  So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.  Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.  Not significantly.  After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.  So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.  Doesn't seem like much.  But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.  I went down another rabbit hole.  1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?  The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.  Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.  Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).  It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.  After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.  And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.  When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?  A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.  But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.  

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.  Short the S&P there.  


Or you could just go to the source, nevermind, retail traders can't get any accurate, up to date, actionable market data.  You can go to the fed, but it's 3 days late.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

**This week's things to watch for:**

  
Tomorrow we also get the results from the Richmond manufacturing index and Consumer confidence.  

Last week, the Empire Index was up (barely) though the prices paid were higher (higher inflation).  The Philly index was down, and prices paid were at 40 year highs.  Tomorrow is Richmond.  Where the fuck is Richmond?  Thursday is unemployment claims, and Friday is another print of CPI.  But it's on a holiday weekend.  So responses should be muted.  If bad, look for a bloody Tuesday.  If good, fuck it, why not?  All time highs again.

In short, no.

SelfWealth members have been allowed to buy and sell GME as  well as others like AMC, throughout the entirety of 2021. This is in  stark comparison to other platforms that entirely halted the trading of  certain stocks.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

my god..

and also they retain the voting rights?! i want out but i dont know who else allows buying of gme and amc... i had a stake account but they stopped letting people buy shares back in January and that's when i got into selfwealth and have been ever since but finding this out today is quiet frightening..

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME –  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.  These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",nkk4c1,where to buy GME stocks in Australia?! SelfWealth is evil and stake was dodgy!

you can legally yolo all your money into a horrible option, and you can become a homeless person or billionaire at any given time. What is the difference between these 2 groups, well to me it is structure.

&#x200B;

You may be saying, 'well I have my trading system so I am good right?', no - you are not. You are missing 50% of the equation. Hear me out:

&#x200B;

A trading STRUCTURE is what should house, or literally be the roof and foundation for your SYSTEM. Imagine a trading system being a furnace, it cannot keep you warm and safe without a roof, walls, and foundation. So, what is my structure and system; here ya go:

&#x200B;

Trading Structure (Literal Home):

**Foundation**: Risk Management - All decisions, all other elements, and all trades are GROUNDED in risk management. I get it, 'Apes Stick Together' or whatever, but I use stop losses - I enter every trade with a set loss and take profit. I do not get emotional, I have a plan, and each trade is a 3 reward to 1 risk setup at least for a small move.

**Walls**: I base my 4 balls of success on:

1. 3 Analysis: 
   1. **Fundamental Analysis** based on news, P/E Ratio, Floats, EPS, etc. 
   2. **Technical Analysis** based on charts, graphs, value. If you are one of those 'AsTrOlOgY fOr IdIoTs' people, fine but understand you are handicapping yourself due to your own ego.
   3. **Mental Analysis** based on confidence, execution, and planning.
2. **Macro Economic** moves like inflation rates, money supply, consumer confidence; and Indexes like S&P, Nasdaq, DOW30, Russell2000, etc. I also study the 11 sectors intently too.
3. **Trading Plan** that includes a stop loss, a loading or buying zone, a price target, and an exit strategy and entry strategy already planned.
4. **Goal Setting** for my 1 month, 6 month, 1 year, 5 year, etc.... and what each trade does to help these goals.

From there my '**ROOF**' or my added protection is consistency. I stick to these rules. Before every trade, I double check with my 'roof' that I am being consistent. When I am in a trade, I check to make sure I am being consistent. When I exit - guess what, I check I am being consistent.

There will be some nights we would all enjoy and actually benefit from not having a roof. Those 73 degree, sunny days come - and we may enjoy sleeping in a tent or even sleeping with the sound of toad ribbits and cricket songs, and we give that up.

I want to call attention to the fact that GME has been consolidating for 2 months and looks just about ready to launch. Check the chart below courtesy of traderstewie. For months GME has been tightening and building higher lows on the daily and weekly. The key level to break out of the wedge is \~190 which we're pretty much exactly at now. Above $190 the path looks open to $300+.

**What I'm saying my friends is that GME is starting to look like a rocket launch site.**

The only thing missing is VOLUME. SPCE & TSLA look interesting but what we're seeing in GME is 5-star. Think maybe it's time we get the band back together.

Not advice, I just like the stock. Do you?

Thus, the banks would no longer operate illegal and unlawful financing should they offer loans and other services to the companies. That would be a huge step in removing what analysts are calling an obstacle to the development of a national cannabis industry.

Legislators voted for the bill with 321-101 votes and sent it to the Senate.

https://preview.redd.it/5mpqdo4tja171.jpg?width=660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1255ec4f5a2471772ca27ad86ea25c16167d241b

The bill clarifies that proceeds from legal cannabis deals are not considered illegal and instructs federal regulators to create rules on how they would oversee such banking activities. Banks have so far been unwilling to do business with companies that sell marijuana or related products, fearing they could run into conflict with US federal law. This has left marijuana companies with few options to rely on a handful of small financial institutions or do cash deals. The American Bankers Association has aggressively lobbied for the SAFE Banking Act bill.

The banks have been in a difficult position due to the conflict between state and federal law, so it makes sense that Congress must act now to resolve this conflict. Thirty-six US states have now legalized medical cannabis, while 17 states already allow recreational use of cannabis by adults.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would try to push legislation. The positive reaction of the stock prices of Tilray, Sundial Growers, Aphria or Aurora Cannabis shows the great relief of investors. Investors hope that this could have kicked off further progressive reforms in the cannabis sector. This move took the potential of a game-changing marijuana law an important step forward.

If Congress passes the SAFE Banking Act and President Joe Biden signs it, it would likely become much easier and cheaper for marijuana companies to raise the capital they need to fund their growth initiatives. The law should also make cannabis companies safer and more efficient, as credit services would reduce the need for cash in day-to-day operations.

Currently the stock is down 15-20% from the opening bell. Who cares? Nobody is fever-buying IPOs like they were late last year or early this year. But this is actually the perfect time to buy in. Why? Well this IPO is actually occurring exactly when YouTube is just about to fuck over all of the business YouTube accounts in the USA.

What is YouTube doing to fuck over businesses? Well they are starting to run ads on non-partnered content. See source here, from the November terms of use update: [https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719)

If you don't want to read this, basically it says that channels that aren't partners are now going to get ads on their videos and YouTube is keeping ALL of the revenue (fuck you, right?). I've personally already witnessed this because I manage YT channels for several businesses and I've already gotten ads. And guess who gets a call every time their client sees an ad on their videos? Me, I get the call. 

&#x200B;

**When does this happen?**

It's already started. I've started seeing ads on corporate non-monetized and uncopyrighted videos within the last couple weeks, but the change is supposed to be implemented across the country in June. I've already been getting calls from my boss and from clients. We are already moving a lot of content to Vimeo.

&#x200B;

**Why does this matter?** 

Businesses are not going to be happy if their competitors are running ads on their videos. Especially if that ad occurs when the video is embedded on their own website. I know for a fact that ads are showing in YouTube but there has been no distinction that I'm aware of that would prohibit them from running ads in embedded videos on a website or blog. 

&#x200B;

**What is going to happen?**

If businesses start seeing competitor ads on their videos, they will do everything they can to stop it. They can either join the YPP and disable ads or they can leave the platform. However, there are requirements to the YPP:

1. They must have 1,000 subscribers
2. They must have 4,000 watch hours in the last 12 months

I can promise you that most businesses do not even come close to meeting these requirements. They can try to purchase subscribers or views but YouTube is good at identifying this. Trust me, I've gone down that road and have seen channels get taken down because of it.

&#x200B;

**Why is VMEO the best play here?**

The main reason is because businesses will leave YouTube.

Vimeo is hand-down my favorite video hosting service for a few reasons:

* The video encode quality is visibly better
* The embedded player is 100% customizable
* It's easier to pick thumbnails
* It has a built-in review system for businesses
* And the best feature, you can update videos without changing the URL (very helpful for embedding)

What's the drawback? It costs $7/month for most of these features. But businesses will gladly pay that to not have their competitors on their website/videos.

RBLX has been on a bull run for past week and more. I wanted to to highlight few critical points here.

RBLX is approaching its resistance, Bearish in short term.  
It might fight $90 for 1 or 2 days, and then retrace to 21 ema (must be close to the ascending support line around $72) Wise decision would be to close a position now and re-enter at a lower price.  
Another data point to be cautions, analysts 12 month high price target - $90.

It started when I had the prophetic revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector. And because increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I stopped smoking weed.  My first thought was that if the government doesn’t release the report then I’m fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report sometime in June. However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it’s another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  After every national emergency, such as saying this is foreign tech would be, it has caused defense contract stocks to go up 5-10%. Also many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.  Finally I looked up ufo on google trends today and it is up 3x its 12 month average.  Google trends have been shown to foresee increase in prices.

If we really need to get this longer then why don't I explain the significance of VWAP. It stands for volume weighted average price. It basically shows the price normalized by the volumes of buyers and sellers that have bought/sold in the past. Why is this important? It's important because it more accurately indicates where there are zones of overhead supply (bag holders waiting to sell once they break even) or pent up demand (most holders are feeling good and waiting to buy dips). In this case, price has been stuck between the psychology of two market participants; the bag holders and the (not?) bag holders. Now that price is above both VWAP levels, more market participants are ITM than not ITM. This means less selling pressure. This means moon.",nkz1y6,GME Anchored VWAP

Hello Hivemind,

From a fundamentalist and technical analysis perspective, I predict with a high degree of certainty that there will be strong price action coming within the next month, and I believe it'll be upward momentum. Here's why:

Fundamentally.  
\-Earnings are in a month. Here we may have another chance at the possibility of seeing the FB settlement or selling of Huwaei patents  
\-Earnings should beat last quarter. I promise you this hack on Colonial pipeline puckered a lot of businesses anuses and companies must all be looking at the best possible ways to increase their end-to-end security, also the shoutout from the hacker Darkside recommending Cyclance (IF the texts were real) is bigger than you think. Also, those of you who are invested and or bag holding should have also subscribed to Cyclance for $29, every one of those subscriptions helps their bottom line.  
\-Increase in advertisements. A lot more sponsored ads coming up on Reddit, Twitter, and also in other forms from Blackberry.  
\-No publicity is bad publicity. We still get connected with Jim Cramer's ""Reddit Stocks"" list on TV, but our price action never moves that drastically in comparison to the S&P 500. I have no doubt in my mind those who actually do their research, follow the price action, and the news from this company they'll see what treasure lies in store, but they could be looking for a better entry price. Currently, the average price target from CNN is $8.76 and $BB is very close as of writing at $8.60. Analyst projections going from $4.60 to $20. Following analyst's opinions are not always a great indicator, but this helps my prediction that there will be some turbulence will be coming soon, up or down.  
\-Massive institutional investment. I cannot stress this enough. Go on Fintel.io and you'll see recent additions to their portfolios from names like:  
\-Citadel. Bought 1,400,000 shares this quarter. Net Long on calls and puts  
\-Great West Life Assurance - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of New York - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of Montreal - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Many others, such as PrimeCap, Fidelity, and Vanguard  
Institutions are getting in, and heavily. there is a possibility that the price was beaten or manipulated down so institutions may enter at a cheap price but that's a different conversation, this is a conversation about $BB and the large chance of a movement, not manipulation.

Technical analysis.

From this picture, we can see how the Bollinger bands are tightening up immensely, and we are about to see a triple cross of the 20/50/200 DMA. Both of these are signals of a large movement in price and if institutions are getting in so recently I couldn't imagine it's going to tank much further.  
An interesting note to make is how nicely the candles follow the Bollinger bands up and down, as well as when they touch the 50/200 DMA. Once the two cross that'll be either our death or golden cross. Hard to say which way, but I'd suggest it's up with all these companies are increasing their portfolio of $BB by 30%+.

This is the reason why I believe this is the signal. Call it apophenia if you aren't into TA but it can be an incredible tool for establishing share price.

&#x200B;

This chart shows the significance of \~$8.60 from history going back to April 2017 on the farthest left. The green dotted line shows how many times it acted as support but as well as resistance.  
This makes our current price range very strong because of how many times BB has touched \~$8.60. There have been times where it has tested below but eventually it has propped itself back up so far every time. It acted as resistance during the first stage of the WSB rally in January, came back down, and that was the signal to the upside.  
The next signal to the upside is \~$14.51 because of the yellow line. That was resistance during the WSB rally in which the daily candle spiked up and as well as acted at resistance on Jan 18 and as well after the crash.  
If $BB breaks \~$14.51 and secures it, $BB may go parabolic again.

But what if it goes down?  
The next support line below \~$8.60 is \~$6.50. But that probably won't happen because of $BB's Enterprise value. As of writing based the enterprise value is $4.98B and in comparison, our market cap is $4.81B, which puts BB's enterprise value and market cap very close in line with each other.

Final notes:  
I believe with a very high degree of confidence that $BB is going to move up now and we've reached very close to the bottom. I understand that it is impossible to predict the market but with these tools, research, my personal understanding of the market and its psychology involved, I think that $BB is primed and the uptrend may begin.

I am not your financial advisor. I am not a professional. I am only a mere student of the game which is life and the market.

I hold 2000 shares of BB and will be adding upon confirmation of the upside.

Please comment below on anything else you believe should be added to this if you have any additional insight to bring forward and I'll certainly edit it in.",nkza6a,$BB - Expect Large Movements WithIn 1 Month.

After a day of small losses it makes you feel pretty shitty and you wish you could have gains and be the true high iq investor you believe you are and seeing a red number on your screen makes you depressed and since you’re too poor to be an alcoholic you have to find a different way to avoid this depression. This is where Wall Street bets comes in. 

You log on and find a group of autist who would make 10x more money if they smashed a keyboard with their head repeatedly till a order went through, but they aren’t smart enough to do so and they also don’t have the brain capacity to understand risk management so this results in heaps of loss porn which makes your depression go away and makes you more confident in your intelligence.

But this isn’t because people are naturally this retarded, if they were they wouldn’t have a brokerage account, that’s where the magic of Wall Street bets shines. A already stupid degenerate with a brokerage accidentally stumbled upon this Reddit and decided to scroll and laugh and ultimately slowly lose brain cells, this goes on and on till they lose so many brain cells that they put all their life savings into a shitty stock because BALLSEATER99 told them it has to go up. They then lose their life savings and post loss porn and leave to never be seen again but for each retard that losses their life savings 2 replaces them.

This entire sub is just a loss porn farm.",nkzhf9,If your on this sub to make money then leave

My hypothesis is that they are pushing for forbearance to end, resulting in a massive wave of evictions and foreclosures,  forcing g homeowners into the rental market. This will also drop prices so they leverage positive cash flow into buying even more real estate.

9868,,2021-05-25 21:14:01,t3_nl07br,,wallstreetbets,"Ford:
Ford’s plan to invest in EVs and self-driving cars rose to $29 billion, including $22 billion for EVs through 2025. 

Ford and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL are entering a six-year deal that will make the tech giant responsible for much of Ford’s growing in-vehicle connectivity. This partnership is designed to streamline Ford’s operations and accelerate an ongoing $11 billion restructuring plan. 

General Motors:

General Motors announced that it plans to invest $27 billion in EV and autonomous vehicles through 2025. The company also mentioned that it plans to release 30 EV models globally by 2025.

The company has partnered with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT in leading a $2 billion investment round in self-driving car startup Cruise LLC.

Difference:
Ford is going with Google and General Motors is going with Microsoft. 

Google has 14 Automotive startup investments and Acquisitions.

Microsoft only has investments in 4 automotive startups.

This will help Ford and General Motors in the following areas:

- Autonomous driving technology.
- Connected car tech & fleet management.
- Electric vehicle technology.
- Automotive retail.
- Mobility-as-a-service & shared mobility.

Who wins?
In this situation Ford has the better outlook, Google with 14 different Automotive startups to do its project development for Ford, also Google has access to Android and will give Ford the ability to integrate mobile connectivity to their cars.

I will keep buying Ford, because of the potential technology integration.
