The amount of float here makes no sense. This is way to thin and easy to manipulate.

The 6% public share is just worth 700million.

They will do share buyback for 300million.

Just that is way too much money chasing too few shares.

Then the owners can cash out at any point once this goes parabolic.

This will take off... but crash again faster than anyone can sell.",,

If you *strongly* believe your meme is higher quality than all the memes currently on r/wallstreetbets/hot, then you may message the moderators.

I know this is disappointing, and you probably put some hard work into this, but this is how we keep the WSB feeds clean for everyone, including the /new feed.

One other thing, a mistake of mine, is remember they are only two, three, and not talk to them as adults. I know, that has a benefit, but not too early.

My local restaurants can't find people to serve me my favorite hamburger and Chipotle now wants to charge me more to make me a burrito.

I used to save all my paycheck that I used to spend going to the bar and picking up 8's that turned into 5's in the morning. I also saved the money I would spend going out to breakfast with said 5 in the AM drinking enough alcohol to turn them back into a 6.5 before we said our goodbyes.

Sometimes I would go to the mall and buy an Orange Julius or a Hot Dog On a Stick. Sometimes I would go see a movie or play paintball with some randoms just to pass the time. And other times I would just go to the local track and play the horses.

But during the pandemic all of that spending turned into gambling on stonks. Waking up early in the morning to read the message boards to see the next hot stonk. Buying calls on BJs and NIOs. Riding OSTK and GME to the moon. And spending hours on end reading Reddit posts.

But now that the economy is reopening I want to do all of that stuff again. Hopefully that 5 is still a 5 and not 300 lbs from binge eating while watching Netflix and Marvel movies on Disney +. Maybe I'll be able to find a mall that has most of its stores in operation and a movie theater with actual real good movies to watch.

This means I'll have less time and money to yolo on stonks. And since Biden and others want to stop the stimmy by the end of the summer. I imagine others will have to get a job too. Which means they won't have as much time to yolo as well.

136,,2021-05-15 21:56:15,t3_nd9hyr,,wallstreetbets,"UWM‚Äôs new buyback program. On May 11, UWM said it would repurchase up to $300 million of its shares over the next 24 months. This is a sort of dividend to shareholders.

With its $12.8 billion market cap, the $300 million represents a 2.34% buyback yield to shareholders (i.e., $300 million/$12.8 billion) over two years. This is also worth 1.17% annually, or 13.6 cents per share.

Add that to the 5.25%dividend yield (i.e., 40 cents annually divided by $7.68). So the ‚Äútotal yield‚Äù as I call it, is worth about 6.42% (i.e., 53.6 cents divided by $7.68). At $10 per share, the total yield is 5.36 % annually more appropriate valuation.

As there are about 1.605 billion shares outstanding, the adjusted EPS will be $1.16 per share. At the recent price of $7.38, this puts UMVC stock on a forward P/E of just 6.4 times forward earnings. That is very cheap.

My estimate of $1.16 is close to analysts‚Äô estimates, as seen by Seeking Alpha, of $1.14 per share. They also estimate $1.23 for next year. That puts UWMC stock on a forward P/E of just 6 times earnings.

I believe a more appropriate valuation is 8 times earnings. That puts the value at $9.84, or roughly $10 per share. This is a potential 36% gain for UWMC stock.",nd9hyr,"UWM Holdings Looks Like a Value Bargain With Low PE and Attractive Yield UWMC stock is worth $10 per share, 36% over its recent price at 8 times forward EPS"
137,,2021-05-15 22:34:58,t3_nda9rc,,wallstreetbets,"The entire steel sector has been on a tear the past 12 months, with companies like US Steel moving from approximately $6 to $25, and I believe there is plenty of room left to run.  Given that steel prices have been at all time highs, the steel producers have relatively low valuations, and other macro factors, the stock value for companies like US Steel could double or triple this year.

**High Steel Prices**

One of the reasons steel producers have flown under the radar and maintained low valuations has been analysts expectations that steel prices wouldn't achieve the levels they have and that they wouldn't stay at these high levels.  *See examples:*  [*https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/steel-price-rally-seen-under-threat-on-global-supply-revival*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/steel-price-rally-seen-under-threat-on-global-supply-revival)  *and*    [https://www.barrons.com/articles/u-s-steel-stock-got-a-rare-double-upgrade-why-it-will-end-in-pain-51610139992](https://www.barrons.com/articles/u-s-steel-stock-got-a-rare-double-upgrade-why-it-will-end-in-pain-51610139992).  

However, prices have risen over the $1,000/ton peak that some analyst called for at the beginning of the year and touched above $1,600/ton his month.  The price has pulled back a little to closing out at $1,505 on Friday.  However, looking at forward contracts for steel, the price is not expected to fall below $1,000/ton until August 2022.  

To better understand how high the price of steel currently is, see the 10 year chart below:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4ngegkdxucz61.png?width=796&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac2e3239d6127c1b08471ff1946c0f6098a554a7

In 2018, X share price almost reached $50/share.  Given where steel prices are now, I would expect it to touch that again.

**Low P/E**

The rise in steel prices have caused analysis to raise their earnings forecasts for the steel producers, but the stock prices do not appear to fully appreciate these earnings projections.  For example, X is expected to earn approximately $7.95/share in 2021.  At a current price of $25.5, X could earn 1/3 of its current share price in 1 year.      

**China Is Curbing Production**

The largest steel producing country in the world is China.  China's steel production growth over the last 15 years has been one of the main reasons for the demise of the US steel production industry.  This is why I don't compare what X's steel price was in 2008 when steel prices were 1/2 of what they are today.  Its just not the same company with China being the biggest player.

However, China has started trying to curb its production with its new green initiative.  [https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3132666/china-targets-air-pollution-steel-overcapacity-new-curbs](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3132666/china-targets-air-pollution-steel-overcapacity-new-curbs)  Time will tell whether China keeps to its climate change goals and cuts its steel production, but if it does, then we can expect steel prices to remain elevated for a longer period of time.

**Spending Seems To Be Under Control**

One of the disappointments in the steel industry has been poor management.  People who have been investing in X in the past remember Mario Longhi and the destruction he did to this company.  Longhi cut spending when he shouldn't have, he rejected new technology upgrades to produce steel, and he was in charge while the company's intellectual property was stolen by Chinese companies who now produce steel at a much lower cost.  Overall, Mr. Longhi's destruction caused the company to lose its top spot as a steel producer.  

X has a new CEO, David Burritt.  Mr. Burritt seems to be doing a good job turning around the company.  Instead of wasting money on money pits within the company, Mr. Burritt went out and acquired a new  technologically advanced steel mill in Big River Steel.  The timing of the Big River acquisition has played out to be a very well time investment as steel prices were close to their low at the time of acquisition and have tripled since then.  

Overall, the Big River acquisition shows that Mr. Burritt is willing to move away from outdated blast furnaces and into lower cost methods of making steel, which will help US Steel's future earnings.

**Tariffs and Potential Infrastructure Play**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, etc.  It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support.  The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

In 2018, President Trump placed 25% tariffs on steel imported from China.  Contrary to what some believe, Biden has made it clear that he is not interested in removing the steel tariffs placed on China.  This should also help keep steel prices higher for longer.

**Conclusion**

Overall, for the reasons stated above, I believe X has the potential to climb 2x-3x within this year, if not more.  There are other companies in this space that I will write my opinion on and explain why all are good investments.  For example, Nucor ($NUE), which I also own, is best in class when it comes to steel producers.  I believe NUE represents a great investment, but it has already doubled in the past 3 months.  I think X has the most room to run and is worth your consideration.",nda9rc,$X might mark the spot on a 2X-3X

Nio = Chinese exchange student 

Pretty bland, doesn't say much. Just an average car that happens to be electric.

Before the content let me say I'm not going to talk about the [fundamentals of this company](https://www.reddit.com/r/MillennialBets/comments/n0414o/uwmc_a_fundamental_analysis_of_why_this_stock_is/) today (they're great), [the value even with no short-term price movement](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nd9hyr/uwm_holdings_looks_like_a_value_bargain_with_low/), [a super good dividend](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/ndc6pu/united_wholesale_mortgage_uwmc_is_the_most/), [the wild housing market](https://the1a.org/segments/housing-pandemic-market/), [the great strategic decisions the company has made](https://twitter.com/SleipnirPerkins/status/1378305915800186884), or anything other than strictly the stock. I like the company, but I love the stock.

&#x200B;

* **Low float, low volume**

UWM has 1.6 billion total shares, but 1.5 billion of them are owned by the CEO and not traded. The Class A shares outstanding are 103million, with \~13million owned by insiders. That's a 90 million public float, with another 25.5million in institutional ownership. Institutions can sell, of course, but a lot of this ownership is large conservative firms that aren't day trading this stock. (Pension funds, Vanguard, etc.). I would estimate the actual ""active"" float at less than 70 million.

Average daily volume is very low - volume Friday was 4 million, and there have been recent days with volume south of 2 million. The last time volume was more than 20 million was the first week of March, and look what happened to the stock. (Spoiler: it ran up to 12.50) If this stock gets real sustained volume, it can and will fly.

&#x200B;

* **Short interest, high short volume**

In the post-GME world we just aren't going to see short interests over 100% anymore - the highest on the market right now is 40-50% in Pubmatic and Root. But the shorts aren't gone, they're just more sneaky. The official Short interest over the last two months has been in the moderate zone, a bit below 20% of the active float. 

Short interest through May 15 won't be available until the 25th, but short volume has spiked since RKT's disappointing earnings took the stock down to ATLs. In fact over 50% of the volume on 6 of the last 7 trading days was short sales. ([Source](http://shortvolumes.com/?t=uwmc)) The shorts are here and they are relentless.

&#x200B;

* **Short Fee Spike, low short shares available, failure to settle**

Last Monday, there were up to 400,000 short shares available with about 3% interest. **Right now the short fees are around (or over) 100% with almost zero shares available to short.** ([Source](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/uwmc)) It's [over 300%](https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_330645419.jpg) on Ortex. This is the same pattern that was seen in AMC last week, RKT in March, and other stocks that have had rapid runs.

Regarding naked shorting and FTS - It's happening, and it's significant. UWMC has been on the threshold securities list for 12 straight trading days. I'll [let the recent post on this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ncczh8/uwmc_on_nyse_threshold_securities_list_regulation/) speak for itself and not explain this again except to say the official FTS data is only available with a 1-month lag so recent hard numbers aren't available.

&#x200B;

* **Huge Buyback**

Monday during earnings, UWM announced they will be buying back **$300 million** **in stock** over the next 2 years, starting this week. At the Friday closing price of 7.51, that's about 42.5 million shares, or **half of the active float** of the stock. Disclaimers: 1) they can only use about half the money (21 million shares) before the public shares become too low to be considered in the Russell 1000, which the CEO has said he wants next month. 2) They have 2 years to spend the money. But, they have every incentive to strike quickly due to the cheap stock price (and the CEO has said as much). 3) There are legal limits on daily buybacks equal to 25% of the average daily volume of the stock - 7M right now, so a limit of 1.75M shares per day. That's still a huge, huge potential amount though.

What does this mean, in effect? Besides the obvious buy pressure and lowering of outstanding shares, **incredible uncertainty and risk for anyone now shorting the stock.** It's tough to go heavily short when a million-share buy order could be coming in at any time. 

There's no way to know when buybacks are happening, but  there was a suspiciously big buy on Wednesday afternoon at about 1:45pm. Based on this and [public statements from the CEO](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nclll1/uwmc_the_most_important_statement_for_all_shares/), It's safe to say that the buybacks are actually happening now and not theoretical.

&#x200B;

* **Options - Would you look at that**

This is where it get juicy. The options interest on this stock is massive, especially on next week's 5/21 expiry. **Between the $7.5 and $15 strikes, there are 205,500 open call contracts expiring next Friday. That's 20.5 million shares if they are all exercised. Most importantly,** the average delta of these options is currently about 0.1 **-** meaning the big Market Makers are only 10% covered on the shares**.** The 9, 10, and 12.50 strikes each by themselves all have open interest near to or greater than the entire daily volume of the stock on most days! 

As for puts, above 7.5, there are almost no (<5000) open puts expiring.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion -** What needs to happen

First, this needs to sustain above $7.5. The stock spent most of the day last Friday banging against a 300k share Ask wall at $7.5, and finally broke it at close (and climbed AH!). This was huge and encouraging, but I am 100% sure the shorts and option MMs will be back to try to pin it at 7.5 all week long. (Tangent: go look at what happened on April 16, the last options expiry date. it closed at 7.49 on the dot, wiping out everyone's options on both sides.)

Second this needs to get to, and through, $9. Once the price approaches and breaks $9, Delta is going to force the MMs to buy shares to cover their contracts. And once the price momentum breaks to the rapid upside through the $9, $10, $11, and $12.5 strikes, there are 12 million short shares that will need covering. 

It's not quite a pure gamma squeeze, and it's not a pure short squeeze, but there's elements of both here and it's all converging this week.

**TL;DR:** This stock has a low active float, a whole bunch of shorts, and a huge amount of unhedged calls expiring on Friday. All in the midst of a gigantic share buyback.  The conditions are perfect for a huge run.",ndcm0p,"UWMC is a powderkeg: low float, high short, huge buyback, unhedged options (Consolidated DD)"

 Let‚Äôs dig in. 

 

### NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

 Not surprisingly, given the economy is still struggling with the current recovery,   ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù                               remains extremely weak. 

 The importance of *‚Äúweak confidence‚Äù* also affects the *‚Äúrisk‚Äù* business owners will take concerning capital expenditures, employment, and sales. **Importantly,¬†this is a** ***‚Äúsentiment‚Äù*** **based survey.** Such is a crucial concept to understand as ***‚Äúplanning‚Äù*** **to do something and** ***‚Äúdoing‚Äù*** **it can be very different.** 

 

### An Economic Boom Will Require Participation

Currently, many analysts expect a massive economic boom in 2021. The basis of those expectations is massive *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* demand as the economy reopens.

**I would agree with that expectation had there been no stimulus programs or expanded unemployment benefits.** Those inflows allowed individuals to spend during a recession where such would not usually be the case. Those artificial inputs dragged forward future or *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* consumption into the present.

However, the NFIB survey also suggests much the same.

**Small businesses are susceptible to economic downturns and don‚Äôt have access to public markets for debt or secondary offerings. As such, they tend to focus heavily on operating efficiencies and profitability.**

**If businesses were expecting a massive surge in** ***‚Äúpent up‚Äù*** **demand, they would be doing several things to prepare for it.** Such includes planning to increase capital expenditures to meet expected demand. Unfortunately, those expectations peaked in 2018 and are dropping back to the March 2020 lows.

 

### Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *‚Äúactually‚Äù* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *‚Äúdemand‚Äù* meets its operating cash flows.

To increase employment, which is the single most considerable cost to any business, you need two things:

1. *Confidence the economy is going to continue to grow in the future, which leads to;*
2. *The increase in the production of goods or services requiring increased employment to meet growing demand.*

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

 Businesses understand that the stimulus [***‚Äúpulled forward‚Äù*** ](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***‚Äúcosts‚Äù*** **of** ***‚Äúlong-term employment‚Äù*** **for a** ***‚Äúshort-term‚Äù*** **artificial economic boost.** 

 

### The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.**¬†Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9vqsosfkshz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=d46a184ce87c222fc678ef69b207c8956ba94d17

 

While stimulus may lead to a short-term boost in consumption, the impact of higher taxes, more regulations, and weak employment growth will suppress consumption longer-term.

Despite economic headlines, the recovery of sales for small businesses has been less than *‚Äúbooming.‚Äù*

 

### A Recovery Versus An Expansion

With this background, it is easier to understand why the recent exuberance in chasing small-cap stocks may be premature. **While small-cap companies do historically perform well coming out of recession, the basis was an organic recovery cycle of increasing productivity.**

Currently, the run-up remains the assumption that the stimulus-fueled recovery is sustainable. **Such is only the case if the stimulus becomes a regular benefit and increases in size annually. However, since** [***deficit-based spending is deflationary***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/macroview-a-vaccine-and-the-new-new-normal/)***,***¬†the outcome will fall well short of expectations.

>*‚Äúin 1998, the Federal Reserve ‚Äúcrossed the ‚ÄòRubicon,‚Äô whereby lowering interest rates failed to stimulate economic growth or inflation as the ‚Äòdebt burden‚Äô detracted from it. When compared to the total debt of the economy, monetary velocity shows the problem facing the Fed.‚Äù*

https://preview.redd.it/2budem4qshz61.png?width=1025&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3597e6ad0a525708b14a84e4b20ec242d56f381

 **Such is a critical point as it relates to small-cap companies given their high correlation to small-business confidence.** The correlation between the small-cap index (Russell 2000) and underlying confidence is very high. Given the annual change in ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù is declining, it is not surprising to see that small-cap stocks recently peaked. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1fi4wzptshz61.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a30c19ab1f3f10f823bbcb3eab9b287201d622e

 

### Conclusion

Given that debt-driven government spending programs have a dismal history of providing the economic growth promised, disappointment over the next year is almost a guarantee.

While there are indeed *‚Äúinflationary pressures‚Äù* short-term as the massive infusions, coupled with supply shortages and delivery bottlenecks, higher prices will erode purchasing power. The decline in purchasing power, combined with higher input costs, and potentially higher taxes, will continue to weigh on confidence near term.

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive.

**Most importantly, there is a massive difference between** ***‚Äúgetting back to even‚Äù*** **versus** ***‚Äúgrowing the economy.‚Äù*** **One creates economic prosperity by expanding production, which creates consumption. The other does not.**

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/4d4qsqg1fiz61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=83455a752058a48e36142935298d3b0975e665eb

GME narrowly edged out PLTR to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. Both the stocks have very similar sentiment due to the wild rides the stock price had this week. AMC also had a significant jump in chatter due to the \~30% rally the stock experienced this week. Newcomers to the top 10 list are UWMC due to their strong Q2 outlook and buyback announcement as well as Alibaba group whose stock took a beating this week but investors are still bullish on the long-term aspects of the company which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/n3f1wc23fiz61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6f1f81111ce5e15f436bf6b3648a6c77e4da3ca)

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Inovio Pharmaceuticals($INO)** was creating chatter mainly due to two reasons. They filed a joint patent with Regeneron($REGN) for treating GBM (a type of severe brain cancer which did not have a cure till now). The trial results look promising and also there have been some unsubstantiated rumors about Regeneron buying out Inovio. Adding to this, they have also completed Phase II trial for their Covid-19 vaccine which showed an excellent immune response. The USP is that the vaccine does not require refrigeration and is cheap to manufacture which makes it ideal for developing countries. Overall investors seem to be extremely bullish on the stock which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Trade Desk($TTD)** stock declined more than 25% on a single day following the company‚Äôs latest earnings report. Even though the company‚Äôs revenue climbed 37% compared to the year-earlier quarter, have kept customer retention rates over 95%, and announced a 10-for-1 stock split, investors did not seem to appreciate the short-term future prospects of the company and were expecting an even bigger beat of estimates. The sell-off can also be partially attributed to ‚ÄúCookie Crisis‚Äù - the traditional way publishers and marketers have collected consumer data ‚Äì through third-party ‚Äúcookies‚Äù ‚Äì is being phased out of the industry due to data privacy and control concerns. This can be an existential crisis for Trade Desk‚Äôs business model. ¬†

**Fubotv ($FUBO)** stock has been highly volatile ever since its IPO in October. The stock spiked as high as $60 but since has fallen to nearly $20. Shares of the company jumped earlier this week due to strong quarterly reports with revenue rising more than 135% and subscriber base doubling from the year-ago quarter. The share price again popped on Friday with the stock finishing up 12.4%.¬†

**Alibaba Group ($BABA)** has been down \~20% last month. Their earnings report also did not help with the company missing the earnings but beat on revenue and annual active consumers. The company‚Äôs earnings were heavily affected by a $2.8 Billion fine imposed by China for Market Regulation. There are mixed opinions from the investing crowd with some believing that the stock is oversold and is undervalued right now vs others believing it‚Äôs not prudent to invest in Chinese stocks.¬†¬†

**UWM holdings ($UWMC)** has been trending due to their quarterly report and the CEO‚Äôs announcement to buy back $300MM of shares. Investors believe that the company‚Äôs share price is at all-time lows and the company having a low PE ratio and a 5.7% dividend yield makes it all the more attractive. The company is also being considered to be added to Russell 1000 in June which can be a short-term catalyst.¬†

SOME FAQ‚Äôs:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

152,,2021-05-16 16:51:38,t3_ndsgrw,,wallstreetbets,"Sup ya'll. I was reading through Roblox investors relations and thought it was note-worthy that this company is not doing traditional quarterly reports and will instead run with monthly reports as a way to be transparent about company progress with respect to bookings, which is their main financial metric outside and of revenue/engagement/developer share.

I expect that this is going to produce some pretty intense price action. I follow this company closely as both an investor and Roblox developer and thought this strategy was quite interesting.

I personally hold a really bullish view on this company. I believe that engagement will go up a lot this summer rather than the somewhat expected decline across some media markets that mostly cater to young adults/working adults.

Kids main consumption/engagement in the market is staying in and playing video games since schooling responsibility is gone. Even when school returns, it's a place for kids to congregate and talk about this stuff. 

# Roblox is basically Instagram for kids and Dave Baszucki isn't a FREAK like ZUCKERBORG. Similar jealousy incentives behind Roblox too. Every kid wants to look unique and not like a default baconhead if you know what I mean.


> Well, envy/jealousy made, what, two out of the ten commandments? Those of you who have raised siblings you know about envy, or tried to run a law firm or investment bank or even a faculty? Ive heard Warren say a half a dozen times, 'Its not greed that drives the world, but envy."" - Charlie Munger 

I wrote super epic 10 page DD on Roblox on the long-term view on the  Developer Studio in case this subject is of interest to anyone. But I'm scared to post it because I might get slam dunked by the automod for the 20 billionth time.

And before you say ""oh ya it's so overvalued it's market cap is bigger than X, Y, and Z"" just take a damn moment to consider that the target market is obviously children, of which there are billions of them. These are customers whose core spend include:

1. Eating and staying alive
2. Clothes
3. Toys 
4. Education

Roblox belongs in categories 2, 3, and 4. Legos earns 5 billion in revenue while Blizzard earns 8 billion. Do the math, the company has potential.",ndsgrw,Roblox will be volatile in 2021 due to monthly reporting over quarterly reports.

I don't fucking know, are there going to be Zerg, possibly who the fuck knows in this simulation. You think they're going to just stop there and this brings me to my next point. Air travel is going to start to recover bigly soon.

Renewables

WIND TURBINES these things are so fucking optimized, have you seen the Haliade-x 14Mw of Power. Have you been looking at the news, look in Biden's eyes you can practically see the propeller turning, he just approved of the first farm. These bitches are going to be popping up everywhere offshore. There's already 17 wind farms being planned in the Atlantic ocean. 1,500 Wind turbines.

You might be like kek I thought they wanted to preserve their coast line or some shit. FUCK NO! They're flippy floppy as fuck and power hungry this is going to happen whether you believe it or not. You don't think GAY PEOPLE are going to want wind turbines?

Plastic=oil=refinery=gas=jetfuel=generators, the most efficent way to create substainable energy!
Them renewables, solar, and wind, and hydroelectric, sure renewable source, solar is 50/50. Hince factor of 2, daytime & nighttime. PowerCell & PowerPacks only store so mucb energy then it has to recharge, another factor, gas products smelt the metals used to make them nigty high tech componets. 
Chips too! It takes more heat than what electricity can or could ever produce to smelt metals! 
Heavy metals and Industry Metals & precious metals. 

Point is, we all need Oil & Gas, and we have GREEN SEA ALGEA! MY EXXONMOBILE GREEN SEA ALGEA BLOOMING FARMS. 
THE GREEN SEA ALGEA, IT EATS Co2 up, and produces Oxygen from Co2! Carbon Nutralized! 
Oh and we can produce Oil, its a clean renewable resource! It produces more oxygen than our factories produce Co2 and green house gasses. 
So the fact is oil is Green Sea Algea, ancient, same form as todays green sea algea! 
Microbiology Professional Scientist! 
I may know more than biden and his fake liars that are uneducated in science, real science. Chemistry. Oil based chemistry stuff our Renewable Resources tech, are made from oil, that plastic covering wires, silicone chips, and metals & precious metals. 
This is real science, facts vrs fictional science.of dnc. Aka bad science and based on no physical facts and proof of concepts would work the way they think it is the main goal. Infact, its my Nuclear Technologies Labatories, is the real energy efficent always on, and renewable and most efficent beyound solar or other chemistry based power generators.
In the early 1990s, i developed a BAD ASS, WICKED CLEAN, NUCLEAR GENERATOR ABOUT THE SIZE OF A SUITCASE. PROTON LASER FUSSION NUCLEAR GENERATOR. REAL ADVANCED, REAL POWERFUL ENERGY PRODUCING GENERATOR! 48MEGA KILO-WATS OF POWER! 
Super DeepCell Power Pack absorbed the energy. It littlerly filled the powercell in 5mins. That a normal old 1950s steam nucleat generator(fukashima version), basicly, that well, its productive energy output is alot less per hour. 
But see, my new Generator dont use steam to produce energy. It uses Pure Fussion absorbtion of particals. And absorbing protons from the burn rate of the nuclear fuel by hot hot PROTON LASERS! 
Oh and its Radiation issues, them lasers, cut the rad half life to 0% of decay in billions of years, to secounds fast. 5mins=30min cool down. Radiation zips down to 0!
Like normal rad background levels like nothing was nuclear in it! 
Science of NUCLEAR ENERGY advanced and economicly affordable! Cheapest form of energy and creates enough Mwh and easy to maintain and it wont go subMuclear Metldown! Its clean and very safe manageble and the most super safest nuclear design ever! 
All them stockpiled nuclear waste of uranium.and plutonium, well, it can eat the 70-80% fuel rods up. And yet, the amount of it lasting more longer for fuel source. Is astronomical longer and more efficent on it takes less nuclear fuel source than previous designs ever, like 1000th less than & produces 10,000% more energy! 
Oil is used to make alot of energy renewable sources, but, the more efficent renewables is alot greater and cleaner than ever before! And greater! Cost afforability and easy to mass produce! 
But without our oil, thats renewable (Green Sea Algea), that produces oxygen, and oil when it dies and decays(1week to 2 weeks), and big bloom farms, we can produce billions of barrels a week or every 2 weeks, and enough to last more over that. So we can physicaly renew a resource and produce more products from it. Plastic, parts  and materials and chemistry chemicals. 
Its tied up into all renewables. Practices and fuction and uses. Developing solar, my big oil is involved 100%. Shale, crude, brent, each are apart of it. And wencan renew it! New oil, constantlu for like ever ever ofnl forever.",,

Here is a guide to the EV landscape today.

tesla =  comedian nerd,
Makes a scene, looks like an idiot, does better than you'd expect with the ladies

Rivian = Wyoming rancher,
Looks like a Ford truck for the most part, just costs $80k, bought by Amazon

canoo = pretty girl, 
Gets great press for its Apple like designs (the ""cutest pickup"" was a CNN headline) has the lowest market cap, gets picked on by the jealous uggos (the shorts) and tried setting up an only fans letting Hyundai take a look at the goods cheap before spac funding

Arrival = sexy accountant,
Small practical British company that has practical designs and has small trial contracts with ups/hyundai. This is the same Hyundai deal that canoo backed out of because Hyundai kept trying to grab its ass. Arrival isn't as pretty so she puts up with it.

Lucid = my dad is rich 

Sleek, expensive, refined. The full blown blue chip factory right from the start. A bit on the bland side, but make no mistake driving a lucid  is  sure to put the riff raff on notice that your daddy can buy his daddy.

Fisker = the Donald of electrics 

Went bankrupt the first time when their Chinese funder had capital issues for their bold design , they are back again for their second try.

Nio = Chinese exchange student 

Pretty bland, doesn't say much. Just an average car that happens to be electric.

Bollinger = big dumb guy 

It's a big truck that doesn't look good that costs $125k. Shrug. You do you.

Lordstown = unemployed guy in fancy suit

Being investigated by the SEC. Testing prototype burned to a cinder, car entered in a race dropped out because it couldn't finish.

Before the content let me say I'm not going to talk about the [fundamentals of this company](https://www.reddit.com/r/MillennialBets/comments/n0414o/uwmc_a_fundamental_analysis_of_why_this_stock_is/) today (they're great), [the value even with no short-term price movement](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nd9hyr/uwm_holdings_looks_like_a_value_bargain_with_low/), [a super good dividend](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/ndc6pu/united_wholesale_mortgage_uwmc_is_the_most/), [the wild housing market](https://the1a.org/segments/housing-pandemic-market/), [the great strategic decisions the company has made](https://twitter.com/SleipnirPerkins/status/1378305915800186884), or anything other than strictly the stock. I like the company, but I love the stock.

&#x200B;

* **Low float, low volume**

UWM has 1.6 billion total shares, but 1.5 billion of them are owned by the CEO and not traded. The Class A shares outstanding are 103million, with \~13million owned by insiders. That's a 90 million public float, with another 25.5million in institutional ownership. Institutions can sell, of course, but a lot of this ownership is large conservative firms that aren't day trading this stock. (Pension funds, Vanguard, etc.). I would estimate the actual ""active"" float at less than 70 million.

Average daily volume is very low - volume Friday was 4 million, and there have been recent days with volume south of 2 million. The last time volume was more than 20 million was the first week of March, and look what happened to the stock. (Spoiler: it ran up to 12.50) If this stock gets real sustained volume, it can and will fly.

&#x200B;

* **Short interest, high short volume**

In the post-GME world we just aren't going to see short interests over 100% anymore - the highest on the market right now is 40-50% in Pubmatic and Root. But the shorts aren't gone, they're just more sneaky. The official Short interest over the last two months has been in the moderate zone, a bit below 20% of the active float. 

Short interest through May 15 won't be available until the 25th, but short volume has spiked since RKT's disappointing earnings took the stock down to ATLs. In fact over 50% of the volume on 6 of the last 7 trading days was short sales. ([Source](http://shortvolumes.com/?t=uwmc)) The shorts are here and they are relentless.

&#x200B;

* **Short Fee Spike, low short shares available, failure to settle**

Last Monday, there were up to 400,000 short shares available with about 3% interest. **Right now the short fees are around (or over) 100% with almost zero shares available to short.** ([Source](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/uwmc)) It's [over 300%](https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_330645419.jpg) on Ortex. This is the same pattern that was seen in AMC last week, RKT in March, and other stocks that have had rapid runs.

Regarding naked shorting and FTS - It's happening, and it's significant. UWMC has been on the threshold securities list for 12 straight trading days. I'll [let the recent post on this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ncczh8/uwmc_on_nyse_threshold_securities_list_regulation/) speak for itself and not explain this again except to say the official FTS data is only available with a 1-month lag so recent hard numbers aren't available.

&#x200B;

* **Huge Buyback**

Monday during earnings, UWM announced they will be buying back **$300 million** **in stock** over the next 2 years, starting this week. At the Friday closing price of 7.51, that's about 42.5 million shares, or **half of the active float** of the stock. Disclaimers: 1) they can only use about half the money (21 million shares) before the public shares become too low to be considered in the Russell 1000, which the CEO has said he wants next month. 2) They have 2 years to spend the money. But, they have every incentive to strike quickly due to the cheap stock price (and the CEO has said as much). 3) There are legal limits on daily buybacks equal to 25% of the average daily volume of the stock - 7M right now, so a limit of 1.75M shares per day. That's still a huge, huge potential amount though.

What does this mean, in effect? Besides the obvious buy pressure and lowering of outstanding shares, **incredible uncertainty and risk for anyone now shorting the stock.** It's tough to go heavily short when a million-share buy order could be coming in at any time. 

There's no way to know when buybacks are happening, but  there was a suspiciously big buy on Wednesday afternoon at about 1:45pm. Based on this and [public statements from the CEO](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nclll1/uwmc_the_most_important_statement_for_all_shares/), It's safe to say that the buybacks are actually happening now and not theoretical.

&#x200B;

* **Options - Would you look at that**

This is where it get juicy. The options interest on this stock is massive, especially on next week's 5/21 expiry. **Between the $7.5 and $15 strikes, there are 205,500 open call contracts expiring next Friday. That's 20.5 million shares if they are all exercised. Most importantly,** the average delta of these options is currently about 0.1 **-** meaning the big Market Makers are only 10% covered on the shares**.** The 9, 10, and 12.50 strikes each by themselves all have open interest near to or greater than the entire daily volume of the stock on most days! 

As for puts, above 7.5, there are almost no (<5000) open puts expiring.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion -** What needs to happen

First, this needs to sustain above $7.5. The stock spent most of the day last Friday banging against a 300k share Ask wall at $7.5, and finally broke it at close (and climbed AH!). This was huge and encouraging, but I am 100% sure the shorts and option MMs will be back to try to pin it at 7.5 all week long. (Tangent: go look at what happened on April 16, the last options expiry date. it closed at 7.49 on the dot, wiping out everyone's options on both sides.)

Second this needs to get to, and through, $9. Once the price approaches and breaks $9, Delta is going to force the MMs to buy shares to cover their contracts. And once the price momentum breaks to the rapid upside through the $9, $10, $11, and $12.5 strikes, there are 12 million short shares that will need covering. 

It's not quite a pure gamma squeeze, and it's not a pure short squeeze, but there's elements of both here and it's all converging this week.

**TL;DR:** This stock has a low active float, a whole bunch of shorts, and a huge amount of unhedged calls expiring on Friday. All in the midst of a gigantic share buyback.  The conditions are perfect for a huge run.",ndcm0p,"UWMC is a powderkeg: low float, high short, huge buyback, unhedged options (Consolidated DD)"

 While the mainstream media overlooks the NFIB data, they really shouldn‚Äôt. There are currently 30.7 million small businesses in the United States[*.*](https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/23142610/2019-Small-Business-Profiles-States-Territories.pdf) Small businesses *(defined as fewer than 500 employees)* **account for 99% of all enterprises, employ 60 million people, and account for nearly 70% of employment.** The chart below shows the breakdown of firms and jobs from the 2019 Census Bureau Data. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zw4426oprhz61.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=5692ffc300115b9a511e1647232fb8032c5f958b

 Let‚Äôs dig in. 

 

### NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w6h4saayrhz61.png?width=907&format=png&auto=webp&s=05dc1256be3e935048e02e19f4c57d0e09cb3e16

 Not surprisingly, given the economy is still struggling with the current recovery,   ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù                               remains extremely weak. 

 The importance of *‚Äúweak confidence‚Äù* also affects the *‚Äúrisk‚Äù* business owners will take concerning capital expenditures, employment, and sales. **Importantly,¬†this is a** ***‚Äúsentiment‚Äù*** **based survey.** Such is a crucial concept to understand as ***‚Äúplanning‚Äù*** **to do something and** ***‚Äúdoing‚Äù*** **it can be very different.** 

 

### An Economic Boom Will Require Participation

Currently, many analysts expect a massive economic boom in 2021. The basis of those expectations is massive *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* demand as the economy reopens.

**I would agree with that expectation had there been no stimulus programs or expanded unemployment benefits.** Those inflows allowed individuals to spend during a recession where such would not usually be the case. Those artificial inputs dragged forward future or *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* consumption into the present.

However, the NFIB survey also suggests much the same.

**Small businesses are susceptible to economic downturns and don‚Äôt have access to public markets for debt or secondary offerings. As such, they tend to focus heavily on operating efficiencies and profitability.**

**If businesses were expecting a massive surge in** ***‚Äúpent up‚Äù*** **demand, they would be doing several things to prepare for it.** Such includes planning to increase capital expenditures to meet expected demand. Unfortunately, those expectations peaked in 2018 and are dropping back to the March 2020 lows.

 

### Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *‚Äúactually‚Äù* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *‚Äúdemand‚Äù* meets its operating cash flows.

To increase employment, which is the single most considerable cost to any business, you need two things:

1. *Confidence the economy is going to continue to grow in the future, which leads to;*
2. *The increase in the production of goods or services requiring increased employment to meet growing demand.*

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

 Businesses understand that the stimulus [***‚Äúpulled forward‚Äù*** ](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***‚Äúcosts‚Äù*** **of** ***‚Äúlong-term employment‚Äù*** **for a** ***‚Äúshort-term‚Äù*** **artificial economic boost.** 

 

### The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.**¬†Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9vqsosfkshz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=d46a184ce87c222fc678ef69b207c8956ba94d17

 

While stimulus may lead to a short-term boost in consumption, the impact of higher taxes, more regulations, and weak employment growth will suppress consumption longer-term.

Despite economic headlines, the recovery of sales for small businesses has been less than *‚Äúbooming.‚Äù*

 

### A Recovery Versus An Expansion

With this background, it is easier to understand why the recent exuberance in chasing small-cap stocks may be premature. **While small-cap companies do historically perform well coming out of recession, the basis was an organic recovery cycle of increasing productivity.**

Currently, the run-up remains the assumption that the stimulus-fueled recovery is sustainable. **Such is only the case if the stimulus becomes a regular benefit and increases in size annually. However, since** [***deficit-based spending is deflationary***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/macroview-a-vaccine-and-the-new-new-normal/)***,***¬†the outcome will fall well short of expectations.

>*‚Äúin 1998, the Federal Reserve ‚Äúcrossed the ‚ÄòRubicon,‚Äô whereby lowering interest rates failed to stimulate economic growth or inflation as the ‚Äòdebt burden‚Äô detracted from it. When compared to the total debt of the economy, monetary velocity shows the problem facing the Fed.‚Äù*

https://preview.redd.it/2budem4qshz61.png?width=1025&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3597e6ad0a525708b14a84e4b20ec242d56f381

 **Such is a critical point as it relates to small-cap companies given their high correlation to small-business confidence.** The correlation between the small-cap index (Russell 2000) and underlying confidence is very high. Given the annual change in ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù is declining, it is not surprising to see that small-cap stocks recently peaked. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1fi4wzptshz61.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a30c19ab1f3f10f823bbcb3eab9b287201d622e

 

### Conclusion

Given that debt-driven government spending programs have a dismal history of providing the economic growth promised, disappointment over the next year is almost a guarantee.

While there are indeed *‚Äúinflationary pressures‚Äù* short-term as the massive infusions, coupled with supply shortages and delivery bottlenecks, higher prices will erode purchasing power. The decline in purchasing power, combined with higher input costs, and potentially higher taxes, will continue to weigh on confidence near term.

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive.

**Most importantly, there is a massive difference between** ***‚Äúgetting back to even‚Äù*** **versus** ***‚Äúgrowing the economy.‚Äù*** **One creates economic prosperity by expanding production, which creates consumption. The other does not.**

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/4d4qsqg1fiz61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=83455a752058a48e36142935298d3b0975e665eb

GME narrowly edged out PLTR to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. Both the stocks have very similar sentiment due to the wild rides the stock price had this week. AMC also had a significant jump in chatter due to the \~30% rally the stock experienced this week. Newcomers to the top 10 list are UWMC due to their strong Q2 outlook and buyback announcement as well as Alibaba group whose stock took a beating this week but investors are still bullish on the long-term aspects of the company which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/n3f1wc23fiz61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6f1f81111ce5e15f436bf6b3648a6c77e4da3ca)

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Inovio Pharmaceuticals($INO)** was creating chatter mainly due to two reasons. They filed a joint patent with Regeneron($REGN) for treating GBM (a type of severe brain cancer which did not have a cure till now). The trial results look promising and also there have been some unsubstantiated rumors about Regeneron buying out Inovio. Adding to this, they have also completed Phase II trial for their Covid-19 vaccine which showed an excellent immune response. The USP is that the vaccine does not require refrigeration and is cheap to manufacture which makes it ideal for developing countries. Overall investors seem to be extremely bullish on the stock which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Trade Desk($TTD)** stock declined more than 25% on a single day following the company‚Äôs latest earnings report. Even though the company‚Äôs revenue climbed 37% compared to the year-earlier quarter, have kept customer retention rates over 95%, and announced a 10-for-1 stock split, investors did not seem to appreciate the short-term future prospects of the company and were expecting an even bigger beat of estimates. The sell-off can also be partially attributed to ‚ÄúCookie Crisis‚Äù - the traditional way publishers and marketers have collected consumer data ‚Äì through third-party ‚Äúcookies‚Äù ‚Äì is being phased out of the industry due to data privacy and control concerns. This can be an existential crisis for Trade Desk‚Äôs business model. ¬†

**Fubotv ($FUBO)** stock has been highly volatile ever since its IPO in October. The stock spiked as high as $60 but since has fallen to nearly $20. Shares of the company jumped earlier this week due to strong quarterly reports with revenue rising more than 135% and subscriber base doubling from the year-ago quarter. The share price again popped on Friday with the stock finishing up 12.4%.¬†

**Alibaba Group ($BABA)** has been down \~20% last month. Their earnings report also did not help with the company missing the earnings but beat on revenue and annual active consumers. The company‚Äôs earnings were heavily affected by a $2.8 Billion fine imposed by China for Market Regulation. There are mixed opinions from the investing crowd with some believing that the stock is oversold and is undervalued right now vs others believing it‚Äôs not prudent to invest in Chinese stocks.¬†¬†

**UWM holdings ($UWMC)** has been trending due to their quarterly report and the CEO‚Äôs announcement to buy back $300MM of shares. Investors believe that the company‚Äôs share price is at all-time lows and the company having a low PE ratio and a 5.7% dividend yield makes it all the more attractive. The company is also being considered to be added to Russell 1000 in June which can be a short-term catalyst.¬†

SOME FAQ‚Äôs:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

I was reading through Roblox investors relations and thought it was note-worthy that this company is not doing traditional quarterly reports and will instead run with monthly reports as a way to be transparent about company progress with respect to bookings, which is their main financial metric outside and of revenue/engagement/developer share.

I expect that this is going to produce some pretty intense price action. I follow this company closely as both an investor and Roblox developer and thought this strategy was quite interesting.

I personally hold a really bullish view on this company. I believe that engagement will go up a lot this summer rather than the somewhat expected decline across some media markets that mostly cater to young adults/working adults.

Kids main consumption/engagement in the market is staying in and playing video games since schooling responsibility is gone. Even when school returns, it's a place for kids to congregate and talk about this stuff. 

# Roblox is basically Instagram for kids and Dave Baszucki isn't a FREAK like ZUCKERBORG. Similar jealousy incentives behind Roblox too. Every kid wants to look unique and not like a default baconhead if you know what I mean.

BUY ONE SHARE at current price 5/18/2021 and hold that bitch for 10 years+ - **THIS IS FINANCIAL ADVISE**, If I am wrong CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT MY ASS AND REPORT ME TO THE SEC, IDGAF!

Not a whole lot of people will claim this so boldly, am I DFV? Fuck no! That guy has a red bandana and the proven gift to make people millionaires, I prefer black bandanas plus he has a degree, or some shit I don't, wish I did, but I don't, yet and that's reality. Look I am going to level with you, I play fast and loose. I don't go with the trends. I am a complete outsider and a rebel. I am heavy long on GE. Do I know what I am talking about? Most likely not, does anyone really know? Make fun of my retarded ass IDGAF!

Its one of the most American Companies around, even more American than Mcdonalds and Coca Cola **combined**. In my opinion THE BEST industrial Giant!!!!!!

ADDITIVE EVERYTHING

3D PRINTED AIRPLANE ENGINES this is some futuristic next tech tree shit you only see in Starcraft. Is Ge going to be the first to make a battle cruiser? I don't fucking know, are there going to be Zerg, possibly who the fuck knows in this simulation. You think they're going to just stop there and this brings me to my next point. Air travel is going to start to recover bigly soon.

Renewables

WIND TURBINES these things are so fucking optimized, have you seen the Haliade-x 14Mw of Power. Have you been looking at the news, look in Biden's eyes you can practically see the propeller turning, he just approved of the first farm. These bitches are going to be popping up everywhere offshore. There's already 17 wind farms being planned in the Atlantic ocean. 1,500 Wind turbines. 

[https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/national-international/changing-climate/offshore-wind-turbines-renewable-energy-atlantic-ocean-new-jersey-united-states-climate-change/2723432/](https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/national-international/changing-climate/offshore-wind-turbines-renewable-energy-atlantic-ocean-new-jersey-united-states-climate-change/2723432/)

And THATS JUST THE ATLANTIC OCEAN, WHAT ABOUT THE fucking LIBTARD PACIFIC OCEAN? You don't think mother fucking California isn't going to want FUCKING WIND TURBINE ACTION? You might be like kek I thought they wanted to preserve their coast line or some shit. FUCK NO! They're flippy floppy as fuck and power hungry this is going to happen whether you believe it or not. You don't think GAY PEOPLE are going to want wind turbines? If there's one thing I know about gay people its they love things that twirl, believe me I loved watching these things in the pass twirl as a kid, and my mom would call me a faggot all the time. I REFUSE TO APOLOGIZE FOR THIS!

[https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/02/11/wind-turbines-could-be-coming-to-californias-coast/](https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/02/11/wind-turbines-could-be-coming-to-californias-coast/)

Guess what fucking state is BETTER THAN CALIFORNIA in wind? MOTHER FUCKING BIG ASS TEXAS, the biggest mother fucking state to ever fucking live, 20% of their energy comes from wind ALREADY, what the fuck are you libtards doing?! TEXAS ALREADY LEAVING YOU IN THE DUST. I broke rule 5, what are you going to do about it, not going to wear a mask in my OWN HOUSE EITHER! Now wind turbines froze up for a bit, but guess what, they can be weather proofed so that shit doesn't happen ever again. They have mother fucking weather proofed wind turbines in Antarctica for fuck sakes.

[https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/](https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/)

And this is just the fucking OCEAN TOO! Guess what wind turbines can be put on also instead of water that's fucking right land too and there's plenty of that all the states have it. ^(One thing to note though wind turbines are much more efficient offshore.) Have you looked at the new CS GO MAP DE\_GRIND? THERE'S ALREADY 22 WIND TURBINES ON IT ALREADY, and believe me THEY'RE GOING TO ADD MORE! I CALL VALVE EVERY SINGLE DAMN DAY REQUESTING MORE TURBINES. That has to be a sign right? RIGHT?

And this is only in the fucking US, THERE'S OTHER FUCKING PLACES ALSO GE just partnered with Toshiba. 10 GW OF power buy 2030 1Gw each year in japan! THAT'S A FUCKING TON OF WIND TURBINES, holy shit. Toshiba is going to put a windmill in every single fucking Japan.

LOOK AT THE FUCKING Gosh dang fastest growing job market right now over the next 10 years. Does that account for anything? Am I the only one that can see the writing on the wall? Am I 6th Sense retarded?!?!

\*\*\*\*\*DON'T READ THIS PART UNLESS YOU'RE JIM CRAMER\*\*\*\*\*

>!Look Jim this part is for you, for your eyes only nobody else read I swear to fuck. I am going to need you to go and drain your bank account and put every single last red cent into GE, I feel it, you feel it. You know WSB doesn't give a shit about GE, I get it that's fine they didn't give a shit about GME in the beginning either with strong hard DD from DFV. Is this going to moon? No, but its going to have a sweet sweet dividend soon and a nice gradual increase for the years with other boomers flocking to it, yes. I know your portfolio is maybe 3-5% GE but I am going to need you to drain everything you have and make it 100% maybe even 130% GE why? I don't know I have a raging hard clue about this, I talked to you in my dreams. Did you have the same dream too? Ya, that's what I thought, we can both smell it blowing in the wind.!<

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Then there's SOLAR POWER, look at the 3rd fastest growing job market. GE is in this as well!

And there's so so so much other fucking cool ass shit that GE does, these bitches can make a train did you fucking know that? How bout all the medical tech stuff? They just released a new portable baby scanner.

LOADS OF DEBT being paid off.

Harry Markopolos the guy that caught Bernie Madoff says there's a bunch of fraud. So you know you are really gambling when you buy this stock if he says so. Nobody is trying to squeeze this. If you're a Tesla fanboy this stock probably isn't for you. Tesla and Edison hated each other, does this matter? Probably not, but it makes you wonder.

$8 Billion FREE FLOAT, not all that good BUT I AM USING CAPS, SO GET EXCITED!

$13 something is current price per share ---> 13 is a LUCKY NUMBER.

BILL GATES SAYS %80 wind/solar by 2040 or some shit like that in his book, believe me I read it

Bill Gates also READ Jeff Immelt book believe me I read it on reddit that he read it! he said so himself.

Jeff Immelt also has a tattoo of a fucking meatball on his hip. (previous CEO) Does this matter? Fuck ya it does meatballs are fucking awesome.

If you guys TRULY love risky plays THIS IS FUCKING IT! I don't know if money is going to start coming out of tech and into value, but if it were going to happen, I'd put my money that its going to happen sooner than later.

Every mother fucking state is going to have windmills, 

Once this ball starts to REALLY ROLL its going to ROLL, ROLL straight up that fucking hill and it won't stop, until its down the next hill then ROLLING up the next one then itll roll straight up fucking up MT EVEREST!!!

I AM WAVING THE FUCKING AMERICAN GOD DAMN FLAG RIGHT NOW ALERTING all of you like PAUL f'ing REVERE. 

If you hate the thought of America creating more job then don't buy. 

If you don't buy GE then you must hate America.  Why do you hate America so much?",ndxk81,"Serious discussion, no seriously please about GE. I know you hate it. Real Financial advice at the tippy top."

Here is a guide to the EV landscape today.

tesla =  comedian nerd,
Makes a scene, looks like an idiot, does better than you'd expect with the ladies

Rivian = Wyoming rancher,
Looks like a Ford truck for the most part, just costs $80k, bought by Amazon

canoo = pretty girl, 
Gets great press for its Apple like designs (the ""cutest pickup"" was a CNN headline) has the lowest market cap, gets picked on by the jealous uggos (the shorts) and tried setting up an only fans letting Hyundai take a look at the goods cheap before spac funding

Arrival = sexy accountant,
Small practical British company that has practical designs and has small trial contracts with ups/hyundai. This is the same Hyundai deal that canoo backed out of because Hyundai kept trying to grab its ass. Arrival isn't as pretty so she puts up with it.

Lucid = my dad is rich 

Sleek, expensive, refined. The full blown blue chip factory right from the start. A bit on the bland side, but make no mistake driving a lucid  is  sure to put the riff raff on notice that your daddy can buy his daddy.

Fisker = the Donald of electrics 

Went bankrupt the first time when their Chinese funder had capital issues for their bold design , they are back again for their second try.

Nio = Chinese exchange student 

Pretty bland, doesn't say much. Just an average car that happens to be electric.

Bollinger = big dumb guy 

It's a big truck that doesn't look good that costs $125k. Shrug. You do you.

Lordstown = unemployed guy in fancy suit

Being investigated by the SEC. Testing prototype burned to a cinder, car entered in a race dropped out because it couldn't finish.

Nikola = your wife's boyfriend

They rolled the truck down the hill because they didn't have a product. Still not the lowest market cap of the bunch, company fired the old CEO because they said he misled investors.",ndb1gv,Comprehensive Guide to EV companies

Before the content let me say I'm not going to talk about the [fundamentals of this company](https://www.reddit.com/r/MillennialBets/comments/n0414o/uwmc_a_fundamental_analysis_of_why_this_stock_is/) today (they're great), [the value even with no short-term price movement](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nd9hyr/uwm_holdings_looks_like_a_value_bargain_with_low/), [a super good dividend](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/ndc6pu/united_wholesale_mortgage_uwmc_is_the_most/), [the wild housing market](https://the1a.org/segments/housing-pandemic-market/), [the great strategic decisions the company has made](https://twitter.com/SleipnirPerkins/status/1378305915800186884), or anything other than strictly the stock. I like the company, but I love the stock.

&#x200B;

* **Low float, low volume**

UWM has 1.6 billion total shares, but 1.5 billion of them are owned by the CEO and not traded. The Class A shares outstanding are 103million, with \~13million owned by insiders. That's a 90 million public float, with another 25.5million in institutional ownership. Institutions can sell, of course, but a lot of this ownership is large conservative firms that aren't day trading this stock. (Pension funds, Vanguard, etc.). I would estimate the actual ""active"" float at less than 70 million.

Average daily volume is very low - volume Friday was 4 million, and there have been recent days with volume south of 2 million. The last time volume was more than 20 million was the first week of March, and look what happened to the stock. (Spoiler: it ran up to 12.50) If this stock gets real sustained volume, it can and will fly.

&#x200B;

* **Short interest, high short volume**

In the post-GME world we just aren't going to see short interests over 100% anymore - the highest on the market right now is 40-50% in Pubmatic and Root. But the shorts aren't gone, they're just more sneaky. The official Short interest over the last two months has been in the moderate zone, a bit below 20% of the active float. 

Short interest through May 15 won't be available until the 25th, but short volume has spiked since RKT's disappointing earnings took the stock down to ATLs. In fact over 50% of the volume on 6 of the last 7 trading days was short sales. ([Source](http://shortvolumes.com/?t=uwmc)) The shorts are here and they are relentless.

&#x200B;

* **Short Fee Spike, low short shares available, failure to settle**

Last Monday, there were up to 400,000 short shares available with about 3% interest. **Right now the short fees are around (or over) 100% with almost zero shares available to short.** ([Source](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/uwmc)) It's [over 300%](https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_330645419.jpg) on Ortex. This is the same pattern that was seen in AMC last week, RKT in March, and other stocks that have had rapid runs.

Regarding naked shorting and FTS - It's happening, and it's significant. UWMC has been on the threshold securities list for 12 straight trading days. I'll [let the recent post on this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ncczh8/uwmc_on_nyse_threshold_securities_list_regulation/) speak for itself and not explain this again except to say the official FTS data is only available with a 1-month lag so recent hard numbers aren't available.

&#x200B;

* **Huge Buyback**

Monday during earnings, UWM announced they will be buying back **$300 million** **in stock** over the next 2 years, starting this week. At the Friday closing price of 7.51, that's about 42.5 million shares, or **half of the active float** of the stock. Disclaimers: 1) they can only use about half the money (21 million shares) before the public shares become too low to be considered in the Russell 1000, which the CEO has said he wants next month. 2) They have 2 years to spend the money. But, they have every incentive to strike quickly due to the cheap stock price (and the CEO has said as much). 3) There are legal limits on daily buybacks equal to 25% of the average daily volume of the stock - 7M right now, so a limit of 1.75M shares per day. That's still a huge, huge potential amount though.

What does this mean, in effect? Besides the obvious buy pressure and lowering of outstanding shares, **incredible uncertainty and risk for anyone now shorting the stock.** It's tough to go heavily short when a million-share buy order could be coming in at any time. 

There's no way to know when buybacks are happening, but  there was a suspiciously big buy on Wednesday afternoon at about 1:45pm. Based on this and [public statements from the CEO](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nclll1/uwmc_the_most_important_statement_for_all_shares/), It's safe to say that the buybacks are actually happening now and not theoretical.

&#x200B;

* **Options - Would you look at that**

This is where it get juicy. The options interest on this stock is massive, especially on next week's 5/21 expiry. **Between the $7.5 and $15 strikes, there are 205,500 open call contracts expiring next Friday. That's 20.5 million shares if they are all exercised. Most importantly,** the average delta of these options is currently about 0.1 **-** meaning the big Market Makers are only 10% covered on the shares**.** The 9, 10, and 12.50 strikes each by themselves all have open interest near to or greater than the entire daily volume of the stock on most days! 

As for puts, above 7.5, there are almost no (<5000) open puts expiring.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion -** What needs to happen

First, this needs to sustain above $7.5. The stock spent most of the day last Friday banging against a 300k share Ask wall at $7.5, and finally broke it at close (and climbed AH!). This was huge and encouraging, but I am 100% sure the shorts and option MMs will be back to try to pin it at 7.5 all week long. (Tangent: go look at what happened on April 16, the last options expiry date. it closed at 7.49 on the dot, wiping out everyone's options on both sides.)

Second this needs to get to, and through, $9. Once the price approaches and breaks $9, Delta is going to force the MMs to buy shares to cover their contracts. And once the price momentum breaks to the rapid upside through the $9, $10, $11, and $12.5 strikes, there are 12 million short shares that will need covering. 

It's not quite a pure gamma squeeze, and it's not a pure short squeeze, but there's elements of both here and it's all converging this week.

879,,2021-05-16 14:29:43,t3_ndpiru,,wallstreetbets," The recent NFIB survey suggests we are only in an economic recovery, not an expansion. 

 While the mainstream media overlooks the NFIB data, they really shouldn‚Äôt. There are currently 30.7 million small businesses in the United States[*.*](https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/23142610/2019-Small-Business-Profiles-States-Territories.pdf) Small businesses *(defined as fewer than 500 employees)* **account for 99% of all enterprises, employ 60 million people, and account for nearly 70% of employment.** The chart below shows the breakdown of firms and jobs from the 2019 Census Bureau Data. 

&#x200B;

 Let‚Äôs dig in. 

 

### NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w6h4saayrhz61.png?width=907&format=png&auto=webp&s=05dc1256be3e935048e02e19f4c57d0e09cb3e16

 Not surprisingly, given the economy is still struggling with the current recovery,   ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù                               remains extremely weak. 

 The importance of *‚Äúweak confidence‚Äù* also affects the *‚Äúrisk‚Äù* business owners will take concerning capital expenditures, employment, and sales. **Importantly,¬†this is a** ***‚Äúsentiment‚Äù*** **based survey.** Such is a crucial concept to understand as ***‚Äúplanning‚Äù*** **to do something and** ***‚Äúdoing‚Äù*** **it can be very different.** 

 

### An Economic Boom Will Require Participation

Currently, many analysts expect a massive economic boom in 2021. The basis of those expectations is massive *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* demand as the economy reopens.

**I would agree with that expectation had there been no stimulus programs or expanded unemployment benefits.** Those inflows allowed individuals to spend during a recession where such would not usually be the case. Those artificial inputs dragged forward future or *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* consumption into the present.

However, the NFIB survey also suggests much the same.

**Small businesses are susceptible to economic downturns and don‚Äôt have access to public markets for debt or secondary offerings. As such, they tend to focus heavily on operating efficiencies and profitability.**

**If businesses were expecting a massive surge in** ***‚Äúpent up‚Äù*** **demand, they would be doing several things to prepare for it.** Such includes planning to increase capital expenditures to meet expected demand. Unfortunately, those expectations peaked in 2018 and are dropping back to the March 2020 lows.

 

### Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *‚Äúactually‚Äù* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *‚Äúdemand‚Äù* meets its operating cash flows.

To increase employment, which is the single most considerable cost to any business, you need two things:

1. *Confidence the economy is going to continue to grow in the future, which leads to;*
2. *The increase in the production of goods or services requiring increased employment to meet growing demand.*

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

 Businesses understand that the stimulus [***‚Äúpulled forward‚Äù*** ](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***‚Äúcosts‚Äù*** **of** ***‚Äúlong-term employment‚Äù*** **for a** ***‚Äúshort-term‚Äù*** **artificial economic boost.** 

 

### The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.**¬†Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9vqsosfkshz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=d46a184ce87c222fc678ef69b207c8956ba94d17

 

While stimulus may lead to a short-term boost in consumption, the impact of higher taxes, more regulations, and weak employment growth will suppress consumption longer-term.

Despite economic headlines, the recovery of sales for small businesses has been less than *‚Äúbooming.‚Äù*

 

### A Recovery Versus An Expansion

With this background, it is easier to understand why the recent exuberance in chasing small-cap stocks may be premature. **While small-cap companies do historically perform well coming out of recession, the basis was an organic recovery cycle of increasing productivity.**

Currently, the run-up remains the assumption that the stimulus-fueled recovery is sustainable. **Such is only the case if the stimulus becomes a regular benefit and increases in size annually. However, since** [***deficit-based spending is deflationary***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/macroview-a-vaccine-and-the-new-new-normal/)***,***¬†the outcome will fall well short of expectations.

>*‚Äúin 1998, the Federal Reserve ‚Äúcrossed the ‚ÄòRubicon,‚Äô whereby lowering interest rates failed to stimulate economic growth or inflation as the ‚Äòdebt burden‚Äô detracted from it. When compared to the total debt of the economy, monetary velocity shows the problem facing the Fed.‚Äù*

https://preview.redd.it/2budem4qshz61.png?width=1025&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3597e6ad0a525708b14a84e4b20ec242d56f381

 **Such is a critical point as it relates to small-cap companies given their high correlation to small-business confidence.** The correlation between the small-cap index (Russell 2000) and underlying confidence is very high. Given the annual change in ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù is declining, it is not surprising to see that small-cap stocks recently peaked. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1fi4wzptshz61.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a30c19ab1f3f10f823bbcb3eab9b287201d622e

 

### Conclusion

Given that debt-driven government spending programs have a dismal history of providing the economic growth promised, disappointment over the next year is almost a guarantee.

While there are indeed *‚Äúinflationary pressures‚Äù* short-term as the massive infusions, coupled with supply shortages and delivery bottlenecks, higher prices will erode purchasing power. The decline in purchasing power, combined with higher input costs, and potentially higher taxes, will continue to weigh on confidence near term.

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive.

**Most importantly, there is a massive difference between** ***‚Äúgetting back to even‚Äù*** **versus** ***‚Äúgrowing the economy.‚Äù*** **One creates economic prosperity by expanding production, which creates consumption. The other does not.**

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/4d4qsqg1fiz61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=83455a752058a48e36142935298d3b0975e665eb

GME narrowly edged out PLTR to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. Both the stocks have very similar sentiment due to the wild rides the stock price had this week. AMC also had a significant jump in chatter due to the \~30% rally the stock experienced this week. Newcomers to the top 10 list are UWMC due to their strong Q2 outlook and buyback announcement as well as Alibaba group whose stock took a beating this week but investors are still bullish on the long-term aspects of the company which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/n3f1wc23fiz61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6f1f81111ce5e15f436bf6b3648a6c77e4da3ca)

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Inovio Pharmaceuticals($INO)** was creating chatter mainly due to two reasons. They filed a joint patent with Regeneron($REGN) for treating GBM (a type of severe brain cancer which did not have a cure till now). The trial results look promising and also there have been some unsubstantiated rumors about Regeneron buying out Inovio. Adding to this, they have also completed Phase II trial for their Covid-19 vaccine which showed an excellent immune response. The USP is that the vaccine does not require refrigeration and is cheap to manufacture which makes it ideal for developing countries. Overall investors seem to be extremely bullish on the stock which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Trade Desk($TTD)** stock declined more than 25% on a single day following the company‚Äôs latest earnings report. Even though the company‚Äôs revenue climbed 37% compared to the year-earlier quarter, have kept customer retention rates over 95%, and announced a 10-for-1 stock split, investors did not seem to appreciate the short-term future prospects of the company and were expecting an even bigger beat of estimates. The sell-off can also be partially attributed to ‚ÄúCookie Crisis‚Äù - the traditional way publishers and marketers have collected consumer data ‚Äì through third-party ‚Äúcookies‚Äù ‚Äì is being phased out of the industry due to data privacy and control concerns. This can be an existential crisis for Trade Desk‚Äôs business model. ¬†

**Fubotv ($FUBO)** stock has been highly volatile ever since its IPO in October. The stock spiked as high as $60 but since has fallen to nearly $20. Shares of the company jumped earlier this week due to strong quarterly reports with revenue rising more than 135% and subscriber base doubling from the year-ago quarter. The share price again popped on Friday with the stock finishing up 12.4%.¬†

**Alibaba Group ($BABA)** has been down \~20% last month. Their earnings report also did not help with the company missing the earnings but beat on revenue and annual active consumers. The company‚Äôs earnings were heavily affected by a $2.8 Billion fine imposed by China for Market Regulation. There are mixed opinions from the investing crowd with some believing that the stock is oversold and is undervalued right now vs others believing it‚Äôs not prudent to invest in Chinese stocks.¬†¬†

**UWM holdings ($UWMC)** has been trending due to their quarterly report and the CEO‚Äôs announcement to buy back $300MM of shares. Investors believe that the company‚Äôs share price is at all-time lows and the company having a low PE ratio and a 5.7% dividend yield makes it all the more attractive. The company is also being considered to be added to Russell 1000 in June which can be a short-term catalyst.¬†

SOME FAQ‚Äôs:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

882,,2021-05-16 16:51:38,t3_ndsgrw,,wallstreetbets,"Sup ya'll. I was reading through Roblox investors relations and thought it was note-worthy that this company is not doing traditional quarterly reports and will instead run with monthly reports as a way to be transparent about company progress with respect to bookings, which is their main financial metric outside and of revenue/engagement/developer share.

I expect that this is going to produce some pretty intense price action. I follow this company closely as both an investor and Roblox developer and thought this strategy was quite interesting.

I personally hold a really bullish view on this company. I believe that engagement will go up a lot this summer rather than the somewhat expected decline across some media markets that mostly cater to young adults/working adults.

Kids main consumption/engagement in the market is staying in and playing video games since schooling responsibility is gone. Even when school returns, it's a place for kids to congregate and talk about this stuff. 

# Roblox is basically Instagram for kids and Dave Baszucki isn't a FREAK like ZUCKERBORG. Similar jealousy incentives behind Roblox too. Every kid wants to look unique and not like a default baconhead if you know what I mean.


> Well, envy/jealousy made, what, two out of the ten commandments? Those of you who have raised siblings you know about envy, or tried to run a law firm or investment bank or even a faculty? Ive heard Warren say a half a dozen times, 'Its not greed that drives the world, but envy."" - Charlie Munger 

I wrote super epic 10 page DD on Roblox on the long-term view on the  Developer Studio in case this subject is of interest to anyone. But I'm scared to post it because I might get slam dunked by the automod for the 20 billionth time.

And before you say ""oh ya it's so overvalued it's market cap is bigger than X, Y, and Z"" just take a damn moment to consider that the target market is obviously children, of which there are billions of them. These are customers whose core spend include:

1. Eating and staying alive
2. Clothes
3. Toys 
4. Education

Roblox belongs in categories 2, 3, and 4. Legos earns 5 billion in revenue while Blizzard earns 8 billion. Do the math, the company has potential.",ndsgrw,Roblox will be volatile in 2021 due to monthly reporting over quarterly reports.

UWMC is *very* undervalued.

The UWMC buyback is limited to 25% of the previous day's volume... Tomorrow, Ishbia will have a nice chunk of change for the first time to put his money where his mouth is. You might be surprised. There's a reason he doesn't wanna let go of 94% of shares to begin with.",,

Before the content let me say I'm not going to talk about the [fundamentals of this company](https://www.reddit.com/r/MillennialBets/comments/n0414o/uwmc_a_fundamental_analysis_of_why_this_stock_is/) today (they're great), [the value even with no short-term price movement](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nd9hyr/uwm_holdings_looks_like_a_value_bargain_with_low/), [a super good dividend](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/ndc6pu/united_wholesale_mortgage_uwmc_is_the_most/), [the wild housing market](https://the1a.org/segments/housing-pandemic-market/), [the great strategic decisions the company has made](https://twitter.com/SleipnirPerkins/status/1378305915800186884), or anything other than strictly the stock. I like the company, but I love the stock.

&#x200B;

* **Low float, low volume**

UWM has 1.6 billion total shares, but 1.5 billion of them are owned by the CEO and not traded. The Class A shares outstanding are 103million, with \~13million owned by insiders. That's a 90 million public float, with another 25.5million in institutional ownership. Institutions can sell, of course, but a lot of this ownership is large conservative firms that aren't day trading this stock. (Pension funds, Vanguard, etc.). I would estimate the actual ""active"" float at less than 70 million.

Average daily volume is very low - volume Friday was 4 million, and there have been recent days with volume south of 2 million. The last time volume was more than 20 million was the first week of March, and look what happened to the stock. (Spoiler: it ran up to 12.50) If this stock gets real sustained volume, it can and will fly.

&#x200B;

* **Short interest, high short volume**

In the post-GME world we just aren't going to see short interests over 100% anymore - the highest on the market right now is 40-50% in Pubmatic and Root. But the shorts aren't gone, they're just more sneaky. The official Short interest over the last two months has been in the moderate zone, a bit below 20% of the active float. 

Short interest through May 15 won't be available until the 25th, but short volume has spiked since RKT's disappointing earnings took the stock down to ATLs. In fact over 50% of the volume on 6 of the last 7 trading days was short sales. ([Source](http://shortvolumes.com/?t=uwmc)) The shorts are here and they are relentless.

&#x200B;

* **Short Fee Spike, low short shares available, failure to settle**

Last Monday, there were up to 400,000 short shares available with about 3% interest. **Right now the short fees are around (or over) 100% with almost zero shares available to short.** ([Source](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/uwmc)) It's [over 300%](https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_330645419.jpg) on Ortex. This is the same pattern that was seen in AMC last week, RKT in March, and other stocks that have had rapid runs.

Regarding naked shorting and FTS - It's happening, and it's significant. UWMC has been on the threshold securities list for 12 straight trading days. I'll [let the recent post on this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ncczh8/uwmc_on_nyse_threshold_securities_list_regulation/) speak for itself and not explain this again except to say the official FTS data is only available with a 1-month lag so recent hard numbers aren't available.

&#x200B;

* **Huge Buyback**

Monday during earnings, UWM announced they will be buying back **$300 million** **in stock** over the next 2 years, starting this week. At the Friday closing price of 7.51, that's about 42.5 million shares, or **half of the active float** of the stock. Disclaimers: 1) they can only use about half the money (21 million shares) before the public shares become too low to be considered in the Russell 1000, which the CEO has said he wants next month. 2) They have 2 years to spend the money. But, they have every incentive to strike quickly due to the cheap stock price (and the CEO has said as much). 3) There are legal limits on daily buybacks equal to 25% of the average daily volume of the stock - 7M right now, so a limit of 1.75M shares per day. That's still a huge, huge potential amount though.

What does this mean, in effect? Besides the obvious buy pressure and lowering of outstanding shares, **incredible uncertainty and risk for anyone now shorting the stock.** It's tough to go heavily short when a million-share buy order could be coming in at any time. 

There's no way to know when buybacks are happening, but  there was a suspiciously big buy on Wednesday afternoon at about 1:45pm. Based on this and [public statements from the CEO](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nclll1/uwmc_the_most_important_statement_for_all_shares/), It's safe to say that the buybacks are actually happening now and not theoretical.

&#x200B;

* **Options - Would you look at that**

This is where it get juicy. The options interest on this stock is massive, especially on next week's 5/21 expiry. **Between the $7.5 and $15 strikes, there are 205,500 open call contracts expiring next Friday. That's 20.5 million shares if they are all exercised. Most importantly,** the average delta of these options is currently about 0.1 **-** meaning the big Market Makers are only 10% covered on the shares**.** The 9, 10, and 12.50 strikes each by themselves all have open interest near to or greater than the entire daily volume of the stock on most days! 

As for puts, above 7.5, there are almost no (<5000) open puts expiring.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion -** What needs to happen

First, this needs to sustain above $7.5. The stock spent most of the day last Friday banging against a 300k share Ask wall at $7.5, and finally broke it at close (and climbed AH!). This was huge and encouraging, but I am 100% sure the shorts and option MMs will be back to try to pin it at 7.5 all week long. (Tangent: go look at what happened on April 16, the last options expiry date. it closed at 7.49 on the dot, wiping out everyone's options on both sides.)

Second this needs to get to, and through, $9. Once the price approaches and breaks $9, Delta is going to force the MMs to buy shares to cover their contracts. And once the price momentum breaks to the rapid upside through the $9, $10, $11, and $12.5 strikes, there are 12 million short shares that will need covering. 

It's not quite a pure gamma squeeze, and it's not a pure short squeeze, but there's elements of both here and it's all converging this week.

**TL;DR:** This stock has a low active float, a whole bunch of shorts, and a huge amount of unhedged calls expiring on Friday. All in the midst of a gigantic share buyback.  The conditions are perfect for a huge run.",ndcm0p,"UWMC is a powderkeg: low float, high short, huge buyback, unhedged options (Consolidated DD)"

1321,,2021-05-16 14:29:43,t3_ndpiru,,wallstreetbets," The recent NFIB survey suggests we are only in an economic recovery, not an expansion. 

 While the mainstream media overlooks the NFIB data, they really shouldn‚Äôt. There are currently 30.7 million small businesses in the United States[*.*](https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/23142610/2019-Small-Business-Profiles-States-Territories.pdf) Small businesses *(defined as fewer than 500 employees)* **account for 99% of all enterprises, employ 60 million people, and account for nearly 70% of employment.** The chart below shows the breakdown of firms and jobs from the 2019 Census Bureau Data. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zw4426oprhz61.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=5692ffc300115b9a511e1647232fb8032c5f958b

 Let‚Äôs dig in. 

 

### NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w6h4saayrhz61.png?width=907&format=png&auto=webp&s=05dc1256be3e935048e02e19f4c57d0e09cb3e16

 Not surprisingly, given the economy is still struggling with the current recovery,   ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù                               remains extremely weak. 

 The importance of *‚Äúweak confidence‚Äù* also affects the *‚Äúrisk‚Äù* business owners will take concerning capital expenditures, employment, and sales. **Importantly,¬†this is a** ***‚Äúsentiment‚Äù*** **based survey.** Such is a crucial concept to understand as ***‚Äúplanning‚Äù*** **to do something and** ***‚Äúdoing‚Äù*** **it can be very different.** 

 

### An Economic Boom Will Require Participation

Currently, many analysts expect a massive economic boom in 2021. The basis of those expectations is massive *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* demand as the economy reopens.

**I would agree with that expectation had there been no stimulus programs or expanded unemployment benefits.** Those inflows allowed individuals to spend during a recession where such would not usually be the case. Those artificial inputs dragged forward future or *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* consumption into the present.

However, the NFIB survey also suggests much the same.

**Small businesses are susceptible to economic downturns and don‚Äôt have access to public markets for debt or secondary offerings. As such, they tend to focus heavily on operating efficiencies and profitability.**

**If businesses were expecting a massive surge in** ***‚Äúpent up‚Äù*** **demand, they would be doing several things to prepare for it.** Such includes planning to increase capital expenditures to meet expected demand. Unfortunately, those expectations peaked in 2018 and are dropping back to the March 2020 lows.

 

### Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *‚Äúactually‚Äù* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *‚Äúdemand‚Äù* meets its operating cash flows.

To increase employment, which is the single most considerable cost to any business, you need two things:

1. *Confidence the economy is going to continue to grow in the future, which leads to;*
2. *The increase in the production of goods or services requiring increased employment to meet growing demand.*

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

 Businesses understand that the stimulus [***‚Äúpulled forward‚Äù*** ](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***‚Äúcosts‚Äù*** **of** ***‚Äúlong-term employment‚Äù*** **for a** ***‚Äúshort-term‚Äù*** **artificial economic boost.** 

 

### The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.**¬†Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9vqsosfkshz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=d46a184ce87c222fc678ef69b207c8956ba94d17

 

While stimulus may lead to a short-term boost in consumption, the impact of higher taxes, more regulations, and weak employment growth will suppress consumption longer-term.

Despite economic headlines, the recovery of sales for small businesses has been less than *‚Äúbooming.‚Äù*

 

### A Recovery Versus An Expansion

With this background, it is easier to understand why the recent exuberance in chasing small-cap stocks may be premature. **While small-cap companies do historically perform well coming out of recession, the basis was an organic recovery cycle of increasing productivity.**

Currently, the run-up remains the assumption that the stimulus-fueled recovery is sustainable. **Such is only the case if the stimulus becomes a regular benefit and increases in size annually. However, since** [***deficit-based spending is deflationary***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/macroview-a-vaccine-and-the-new-new-normal/)***,***¬†the outcome will fall well short of expectations.

>*‚Äúin 1998, the Federal Reserve ‚Äúcrossed the ‚ÄòRubicon,‚Äô whereby lowering interest rates failed to stimulate economic growth or inflation as the ‚Äòdebt burden‚Äô detracted from it. When compared to the total debt of the economy, monetary velocity shows the problem facing the Fed.‚Äù*

https://preview.redd.it/2budem4qshz61.png?width=1025&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3597e6ad0a525708b14a84e4b20ec242d56f381

 **Such is a critical point as it relates to small-cap companies given their high correlation to small-business confidence.** The correlation between the small-cap index (Russell 2000) and underlying confidence is very high. Given the annual change in ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù is declining, it is not surprising to see that small-cap stocks recently peaked. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1fi4wzptshz61.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a30c19ab1f3f10f823bbcb3eab9b287201d622e

 

### Conclusion

Given that debt-driven government spending programs have a dismal history of providing the economic growth promised, disappointment over the next year is almost a guarantee.

While there are indeed *‚Äúinflationary pressures‚Äù* short-term as the massive infusions, coupled with supply shortages and delivery bottlenecks, higher prices will erode purchasing power. The decline in purchasing power, combined with higher input costs, and potentially higher taxes, will continue to weigh on confidence near term.

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive.

**Most importantly, there is a massive difference between** ***‚Äúgetting back to even‚Äù*** **versus** ***‚Äúgrowing the economy.‚Äù*** **One creates economic prosperity by expanding production, which creates consumption. The other does not.**

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/4d4qsqg1fiz61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=83455a752058a48e36142935298d3b0975e665eb

GME narrowly edged out PLTR to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. Both the stocks have very similar sentiment due to the wild rides the stock price had this week. AMC also had a significant jump in chatter due to the \~30% rally the stock experienced this week. Newcomers to the top 10 list are UWMC due to their strong Q2 outlook and buyback announcement as well as Alibaba group whose stock took a beating this week but investors are still bullish on the long-term aspects of the company which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/n3f1wc23fiz61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6f1f81111ce5e15f436bf6b3648a6c77e4da3ca)

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Inovio Pharmaceuticals($INO)** was creating chatter mainly due to two reasons. They filed a joint patent with Regeneron($REGN) for treating GBM (a type of severe brain cancer which did not have a cure till now). The trial results look promising and also there have been some unsubstantiated rumors about Regeneron buying out Inovio. Adding to this, they have also completed Phase II trial for their Covid-19 vaccine which showed an excellent immune response. The USP is that the vaccine does not require refrigeration and is cheap to manufacture which makes it ideal for developing countries. Overall investors seem to be extremely bullish on the stock which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Trade Desk($TTD)** stock declined more than 25% on a single day following the company‚Äôs latest earnings report. Even though the company‚Äôs revenue climbed 37% compared to the year-earlier quarter, have kept customer retention rates over 95%, and announced a 10-for-1 stock split, investors did not seem to appreciate the short-term future prospects of the company and were expecting an even bigger beat of estimates. The sell-off can also be partially attributed to ‚ÄúCookie Crisis‚Äù - the traditional way publishers and marketers have collected consumer data ‚Äì through third-party ‚Äúcookies‚Äù ‚Äì is being phased out of the industry due to data privacy and control concerns. This can be an existential crisis for Trade Desk‚Äôs business model. ¬†

**Fubotv ($FUBO)** stock has been highly volatile ever since its IPO in October. The stock spiked as high as $60 but since has fallen to nearly $20. Shares of the company jumped earlier this week due to strong quarterly reports with revenue rising more than 135% and subscriber base doubling from the year-ago quarter. The share price again popped on Friday with the stock finishing up 12.4%.¬†

**Alibaba Group ($BABA)** has been down \~20% last month. Their earnings report also did not help with the company missing the earnings but beat on revenue and annual active consumers. The company‚Äôs earnings were heavily affected by a $2.8 Billion fine imposed by China for Market Regulation. There are mixed opinions from the investing crowd with some believing that the stock is oversold and is undervalued right now vs others believing it‚Äôs not prudent to invest in Chinese stocks.¬†¬†

**UWM holdings ($UWMC)** has been trending due to their quarterly report and the CEO‚Äôs announcement to buy back $300MM of shares. Investors believe that the company‚Äôs share price is at all-time lows and the company having a low PE ratio and a 5.7% dividend yield makes it all the more attractive. The company is also being considered to be added to Russell 1000 in June which can be a short-term catalyst.¬†

SOME FAQ‚Äôs:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

1324,,2021-05-16 16:51:38,t3_ndsgrw,,wallstreetbets,"Sup ya'll. I was reading through Roblox investors relations and thought it was note-worthy that this company is not doing traditional quarterly reports and will instead run with monthly reports as a way to be transparent about company progress with respect to bookings, which is their main financial metric outside and of revenue/engagement/developer share.

I expect that this is going to produce some pretty intense price action. I follow this company closely as both an investor and Roblox developer and thought this strategy was quite interesting.

I personally hold a really bullish view on this company. I believe that engagement will go up a lot this summer rather than the somewhat expected decline across some media markets that mostly cater to young adults/working adults.

Kids main consumption/engagement in the market is staying in and playing video games since schooling responsibility is gone. Even when school returns, it's a place for kids to congregate and talk about this stuff. 

# Roblox is basically Instagram for kids and Dave Baszucki isn't a FREAK like ZUCKERBORG. Similar jealousy incentives behind Roblox too. Every kid wants to look unique and not like a default baconhead if you know what I mean.

I wrote super epic 10 page DD on Roblox on the long-term view on the  Developer Studio in case this subject is of interest to anyone. But I'm scared to post it because I might get slam dunked by the automod for the 20 billionth time.

And before you say ""oh ya it's so overvalued it's market cap is bigger than X, Y, and Z"" just take a damn moment to consider that the target market is obviously children, of which there are billions of them. These are customers whose core spend include:

1. Eating and staying alive
2. Clothes
3. Toys 
4. Education

Roblox belongs in categories 2, 3, and 4. Legos earns 5 billion in revenue while Blizzard earns 8 billion. Do the math, the company has potential.",ndsgrw,Roblox will be volatile in 2021 due to monthly reporting over quarterly reports.

Not a whole lot of people will claim this so boldly, am I DFV? Fuck no! That guy has a red bandana and the proven gift to make people millionaires, I prefer black bandanas plus he has a degree, or some shit I don't, wish I did, but I don't, yet and that's reality. Look I am going to level with you, I play fast and loose. I don't go with the trends. I am a complete outsider and a rebel. I am heavy long on GE. Do I know what I am talking about? Most likely not, does anyone really know? Make fun of my retarded ass IDGAF!

Its one of the most American Companies around, even more American than Mcdonalds and Coca Cola **combined**. In my opinion THE BEST industrial Giant!!!!!!

ADDITIVE EVERYTHING

3D PRINTED AIRPLANE ENGINES this is some futuristic next tech tree shit you only see in Starcraft. Is Ge going to be the first to make a battle cruiser? I don't fucking know, are there going to be Zerg, possibly who the fuck knows in this simulation. You think they're going to just stop there and this brings me to my next point. Air travel is going to start to recover bigly soon.

Renewables

WIND TURBINES these things are so fucking optimized, have you seen the Haliade-x 14Mw of Power. Have you been looking at the news, look in Biden's eyes you can practically see the propeller turning, he just approved of the first farm. These bitches are going to be popping up everywhere offshore. There's already 17 wind farms being planned in the Atlantic ocean. 1,500 Wind turbines.

And THATS JUST THE ATLANTIC OCEAN, WHAT ABOUT THE fucking LIBTARD PACIFIC OCEAN? You don't think mother fucking California isn't going to want FUCKING WIND TURBINE ACTION? You might be like kek I thought they wanted to preserve their coast line or some shit. FUCK NO! They're flippy floppy as fuck and power hungry this is going to happen whether you believe it or not. You don't think GAY PEOPLE are going to want wind turbines? If there's one thing I know about gay people its they love things that twirl, believe me I loved watching these things in the pass twirl as a kid, and my mom would call me a faggot all the time. I REFUSE TO APOLOGIZE FOR THIS!

[https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/02/11/wind-turbines-could-be-coming-to-californias-coast/](https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/02/11/wind-turbines-could-be-coming-to-californias-coast/)

Guess what fucking state is BETTER THAN CALIFORNIA in wind? MOTHER FUCKING BIG ASS TEXAS, the biggest mother fucking state to ever fucking live, 20% of their energy comes from wind ALREADY, what the fuck are you libtards doing?! TEXAS ALREADY LEAVING YOU IN THE DUST. I broke rule 5, what are you going to do about it, not going to wear a mask in my OWN HOUSE EITHER! Now wind turbines froze up for a bit, but guess what, they can be weather proofed so that shit doesn't happen ever again. They have mother fucking weather proofed wind turbines in Antarctica for fuck sakes.

[https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/](https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/)

And this is just the fucking OCEAN TOO! Guess what wind turbines can be put on also instead of water that's fucking right land too and there's plenty of that all the states have it. ^(One thing to note though wind turbines are much more efficient offshore.) Have you looked at the new CS GO MAP DE\_GRIND? THERE'S ALREADY 22 WIND TURBINES ON IT ALREADY, and believe me THEY'RE GOING TO ADD MORE! I CALL VALVE EVERY SINGLE DAMN DAY REQUESTING MORE TURBINES. That has to be a sign right? RIGHT?

And this is only in the fucking US, THERE'S OTHER FUCKING PLACES ALSO GE just partnered with Toshiba. 10 GW OF power buy 2030 1Gw each year in japan! THAT'S A FUCKING TON OF WIND TURBINES, holy shit. Toshiba is going to put a windmill in every single fucking Japan.

LOOK AT THE FUCKING Gosh dang fastest growing job market right now over the next 10 years. Does that account for anything? Am I the only one that can see the writing on the wall? Am I 6th Sense retarded?!?!

\*\*\*\*\*DON'T READ THIS PART UNLESS YOU'RE JIM CRAMER\*\*\*\*\*

>!Look Jim this part is for you, for your eyes only nobody else read I swear to fuck. I am going to need you to go and drain your bank account and put every single last red cent into GE, I feel it, you feel it. You know WSB doesn't give a shit about GE, I get it that's fine they didn't give a shit about GME in the beginning either with strong hard DD from DFV. Is this going to moon? No, but its going to have a sweet sweet dividend soon and a nice gradual increase for the years with other boomers flocking to it, yes. I know your portfolio is maybe 3-5% GE but I am going to need you to drain everything you have and make it 100% maybe even 130% GE why? I don't know I have a raging hard clue about this, I talked to you in my dreams. Did you have the same dream too? Ya, that's what I thought, we can both smell it blowing in the wind.!<

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Then there's SOLAR POWER, look at the 3rd fastest growing job market. GE is in this as well!

And there's so so so much other fucking cool ass shit that GE does, these bitches can make a train did you fucking know that? How bout all the medical tech stuff? They just released a new portable baby scanner.

LOADS OF DEBT being paid off.

Harry Markopolos the guy that caught Bernie Madoff says there's a bunch of fraud. So you know you are really gambling when you buy this stock if he says so. Nobody is trying to squeeze this. If you're a Tesla fanboy this stock probably isn't for you. Tesla and Edison hated each other, does this matter? Probably not, but it makes you wonder.

$8 Billion FREE FLOAT, not all that good BUT I AM USING CAPS, SO GET EXCITED!

$13 something is current price per share ---> 13 is a LUCKY NUMBER.

BILL GATES SAYS %80 wind/solar by 2040 or some shit like that in his book, believe me I read it

Bill Gates also READ Jeff Immelt book believe me I read it on reddit that he read it! he said so himself.

Jeff Immelt also has a tattoo of a fucking meatball on his hip. (previous CEO) Does this matter? Fuck ya it does meatballs are fucking awesome.

If you guys TRULY love risky plays THIS IS FUCKING IT! I don't know if money is going to start coming out of tech and into value, but if it were going to happen, I'd put my money that its going to happen sooner than later.

Every mother fucking state is going to have windmills, 

Once this ball starts to REALLY ROLL its going to ROLL, ROLL straight up that fucking hill and it won't stop, until its down the next hill then ROLLING up the next one then itll roll straight up fucking up MT EVEREST!!!

I AM WAVING THE FUCKING AMERICAN GOD DAMN FLAG RIGHT NOW ALERTING all of you like PAUL f'ing REVERE. 

If you hate the thought of America creating more job then don't buy. 

If you don't buy GE then you must hate America.  Why do you hate America so much?",ndxk81,"Serious discussion, no seriously please about GE. I know you hate it. Real Financial advice at the tippy top."

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

&nbsp;

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

&nbsp;

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, and checking out my socials, it would mean a lot to me! **Happy Trading Everybody! :)**",ne1fla,"Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation (Week 5) - $HD, $WMT, $TGT, $LOW, $CSCO, $GOEV, $XL, $SE and More"

They made paper money on the way down but I feel sorry for them on the way back up to $20s and even $30+. Spread the word.

He has a bachelor's degree in physics. That's a solid achievement but it doesn't put you in the same league as those with a doctorate or more under their belt.

> and in SpaceX interviews where people actually asked him meaningful questions he could explain most anything into detail.

Maybe, I haven't seen most of those. However for the things I have seen he sounds like someone parrotting a discussion he overheard. It never has any depth or substance to it.

> Did he actually give lectures that we can see online? Would be interesting to see. I mean I doubt anyone with only a BSc is qualified to be a lecturer but neither do most guest profs ever present anything in depth in my experience. It's always more a TED talk of some kind.

What I mean by a lecture at a university is just as a guest speaker, not as a lecturing professor.

I've not followed Musk for years but I *think* these are two videos I watched:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1HZIQliuoA

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVk1hb0ZOrE

> Also quantum mathematics is a thing, afaik.

It's not a thing. At least it's not a thing in the common venacular of research physicists or mathematicians. Mathematics is just mathematics, there's no special 'quantum mathematics'.

I'm sure someone has used the term somewhere online, but it's not a phrase you'll ever hear in real life.

-------

But anyway I'm not really interested in the Musk-o-sphere, but I'm occasionally asked what my opinion of him\his ventures are (because I'm a research physicist).

* Tesla: Cool but overvalued - TSD will take a lot longer to arrive than expected. They have good BMS IP

* SpaceX: Skeptical of their cost savings. Books are closed and they have a huge appetite for VC money. I reckon they're launching at a massive loss and don't think it'll be as revolutionary as they pitch. Might become another big gear in the military industrial complex though.

* NeuraLink: Just no. Exists for hype.

* Boring Company: Just no. Exists for hype.

* SolarCity: Don't know much about but it's super suss how Tesla acquired them when they had liquidity issues, and didn't tell shareholders.

Overall I'm happy with sticking to sectors I understand better and that don't need hype to sustain their market price. ASML is a major one in the portfolio for example.",,

This post isn't intended to draw away from that, just an opportunity that I see and would like to share. This play is based on $AMCs undoubtable liftoff to $30+.

AMC READY TO FLY.

Plenty of DD has been done on AMC and why its going to take off - I'm not here to talk about that. It is coiled, has popped, and is ready to rip a new butthole in the sky.

&#x200B;

$CNK is AMCs largest competitor and is in the great business we know as movie theaters. When AMC last went crazy, CNK ran up over 56% in a few days from 22-27 of January to $27+. In the past month, AMC is up over 50%. CNK is roughly even. It is lagging behind and is due for a major pop on this AMC craze. It is a classically more boring stock that takes a big nudge to move.

Breaking out similar to AMC. Insanely strong volume shelf in low 20s (high demand) and above 1D 21MA. RSI has lots of room to run. 

**MARGIN**

CNK has a much lower implied volatility and actually allows for margin borrowing. This could be attractive depending on your risk appetite

**DILUTION/FINANCIALS**

CNK has almost no share dilution since the pandemic started, and it has been historically stronger than AMC from a traditional (retarded) financial perspective. AMCs market value growth has passed CNKs by many multiples over the past year. No reason she can't get some love.

Don't overthink it. We love this guy. Fuck you and lets make some money:

1933,,2021-05-16 14:29:43,t3_ndpiru,,wallstreetbets," The recent NFIB survey suggests we are only in an economic recovery, not an expansion. 

 While the mainstream media overlooks the NFIB data, they really shouldn‚Äôt. There are currently 30.7 million small businesses in the United States[*.*](https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/23142610/2019-Small-Business-Profiles-States-Territories.pdf) Small businesses *(defined as fewer than 500 employees)* **account for 99% of all enterprises, employ 60 million people, and account for nearly 70% of employment.** The chart below shows the breakdown of firms and jobs from the 2019 Census Bureau Data. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zw4426oprhz61.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=5692ffc300115b9a511e1647232fb8032c5f958b

 Let‚Äôs dig in. 

 

### NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w6h4saayrhz61.png?width=907&format=png&auto=webp&s=05dc1256be3e935048e02e19f4c57d0e09cb3e16

 Not surprisingly, given the economy is still struggling with the current recovery,   ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù                               remains extremely weak. 

 The importance of *‚Äúweak confidence‚Äù* also affects the *‚Äúrisk‚Äù* business owners will take concerning capital expenditures, employment, and sales. **Importantly,¬†this is a** ***‚Äúsentiment‚Äù*** **based survey.** Such is a crucial concept to understand as ***‚Äúplanning‚Äù*** **to do something and** ***‚Äúdoing‚Äù*** **it can be very different.** 

 

### An Economic Boom Will Require Participation

Currently, many analysts expect a massive economic boom in 2021. The basis of those expectations is massive *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* demand as the economy reopens.

**I would agree with that expectation had there been no stimulus programs or expanded unemployment benefits.** Those inflows allowed individuals to spend during a recession where such would not usually be the case. Those artificial inputs dragged forward future or *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* consumption into the present.

However, the NFIB survey also suggests much the same.

**Small businesses are susceptible to economic downturns and don‚Äôt have access to public markets for debt or secondary offerings. As such, they tend to focus heavily on operating efficiencies and profitability.**

**If businesses were expecting a massive surge in** ***‚Äúpent up‚Äù*** **demand, they would be doing several things to prepare for it.** Such includes planning to increase capital expenditures to meet expected demand. Unfortunately, those expectations peaked in 2018 and are dropping back to the March 2020 lows.

 

### Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *‚Äúactually‚Äù* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *‚Äúdemand‚Äù* meets its operating cash flows.

To increase employment, which is the single most considerable cost to any business, you need two things:

1. *Confidence the economy is going to continue to grow in the future, which leads to;*
2. *The increase in the production of goods or services requiring increased employment to meet growing demand.*

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

&#x200B;

 Businesses understand that the stimulus [***‚Äúpulled forward‚Äù*** ](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***‚Äúcosts‚Äù*** **of** ***‚Äúlong-term employment‚Äù*** **for a** ***‚Äúshort-term‚Äù*** **artificial economic boost.** 

 

### The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.**¬†Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9vqsosfkshz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=d46a184ce87c222fc678ef69b207c8956ba94d17

 

While stimulus may lead to a short-term boost in consumption, the impact of higher taxes, more regulations, and weak employment growth will suppress consumption longer-term.

Despite economic headlines, the recovery of sales for small businesses has been less than *‚Äúbooming.‚Äù*

 

### A Recovery Versus An Expansion

With this background, it is easier to understand why the recent exuberance in chasing small-cap stocks may be premature. **While small-cap companies do historically perform well coming out of recession, the basis was an organic recovery cycle of increasing productivity.**

Currently, the run-up remains the assumption that the stimulus-fueled recovery is sustainable. **Such is only the case if the stimulus becomes a regular benefit and increases in size annually. However, since** [***deficit-based spending is deflationary***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/macroview-a-vaccine-and-the-new-new-normal/)***,***¬†the outcome will fall well short of expectations.

>*‚Äúin 1998, the Federal Reserve ‚Äúcrossed the ‚ÄòRubicon,‚Äô whereby lowering interest rates failed to stimulate economic growth or inflation as the ‚Äòdebt burden‚Äô detracted from it. When compared to the total debt of the economy, monetary velocity shows the problem facing the Fed.‚Äù*

https://preview.redd.it/2budem4qshz61.png?width=1025&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3597e6ad0a525708b14a84e4b20ec242d56f381

 **Such is a critical point as it relates to small-cap companies given their high correlation to small-business confidence.** The correlation between the small-cap index (Russell 2000) and underlying confidence is very high. Given the annual change in ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù is declining, it is not surprising to see that small-cap stocks recently peaked. 

&#x200B;

### Conclusion

Given that debt-driven government spending programs have a dismal history of providing the economic growth promised, disappointment over the next year is almost a guarantee.

While there are indeed *‚Äúinflationary pressures‚Äù* short-term as the massive infusions, coupled with supply shortages and delivery bottlenecks, higher prices will erode purchasing power. The decline in purchasing power, combined with higher input costs, and potentially higher taxes, will continue to weigh on confidence near term.

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive.

**Most importantly, there is a massive difference between** ***‚Äúgetting back to even‚Äù*** **versus** ***‚Äúgrowing the economy.‚Äù*** **One creates economic prosperity by expanding production, which creates consumption. The other does not.**

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/4d4qsqg1fiz61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=83455a752058a48e36142935298d3b0975e665eb

GME narrowly edged out PLTR to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. Both the stocks have very similar sentiment due to the wild rides the stock price had this week. AMC also had a significant jump in chatter due to the \~30% rally the stock experienced this week. Newcomers to the top 10 list are UWMC due to their strong Q2 outlook and buyback announcement as well as Alibaba group whose stock took a beating this week but investors are still bullish on the long-term aspects of the company which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/n3f1wc23fiz61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6f1f81111ce5e15f436bf6b3648a6c77e4da3ca)

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Inovio Pharmaceuticals($INO)** was creating chatter mainly due to two reasons. They filed a joint patent with Regeneron($REGN) for treating GBM (a type of severe brain cancer which did not have a cure till now). The trial results look promising and also there have been some unsubstantiated rumors about Regeneron buying out Inovio. Adding to this, they have also completed Phase II trial for their Covid-19 vaccine which showed an excellent immune response. The USP is that the vaccine does not require refrigeration and is cheap to manufacture which makes it ideal for developing countries. Overall investors seem to be extremely bullish on the stock which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Trade Desk($TTD)** stock declined more than 25% on a single day following the company‚Äôs latest earnings report. Even though the company‚Äôs revenue climbed 37% compared to the year-earlier quarter, have kept customer retention rates over 95%, and announced a 10-for-1 stock split, investors did not seem to appreciate the short-term future prospects of the company and were expecting an even bigger beat of estimates. The sell-off can also be partially attributed to ‚ÄúCookie Crisis‚Äù - the traditional way publishers and marketers have collected consumer data ‚Äì through third-party ‚Äúcookies‚Äù ‚Äì is being phased out of the industry due to data privacy and control concerns. This can be an existential crisis for Trade Desk‚Äôs business model. ¬†

**Fubotv ($FUBO)** stock has been highly volatile ever since its IPO in October. The stock spiked as high as $60 but since has fallen to nearly $20. Shares of the company jumped earlier this week due to strong quarterly reports with revenue rising more than 135% and subscriber base doubling from the year-ago quarter. The share price again popped on Friday with the stock finishing up 12.4%.¬†

**Alibaba Group ($BABA)** has been down \~20% last month. Their earnings report also did not help with the company missing the earnings but beat on revenue and annual active consumers. The company‚Äôs earnings were heavily affected by a $2.8 Billion fine imposed by China for Market Regulation. There are mixed opinions from the investing crowd with some believing that the stock is oversold and is undervalued right now vs others believing it‚Äôs not prudent to invest in Chinese stocks.¬†¬†

**UWM holdings ($UWMC)** has been trending due to their quarterly report and the CEO‚Äôs announcement to buy back $300MM of shares. Investors believe that the company‚Äôs share price is at all-time lows and the company having a low PE ratio and a 5.7% dividend yield makes it all the more attractive. The company is also being considered to be added to Russell 1000 in June which can be a short-term catalyst.¬†

SOME FAQ‚Äôs:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

1936,,2021-05-16 16:51:38,t3_ndsgrw,,wallstreetbets,"Sup ya'll. I was reading through Roblox investors relations and thought it was note-worthy that this company is not doing traditional quarterly reports and will instead run with monthly reports as a way to be transparent about company progress with respect to bookings, which is their main financial metric outside and of revenue/engagement/developer share.

I expect that this is going to produce some pretty intense price action. I follow this company closely as both an investor and Roblox developer and thought this strategy was quite interesting.

I personally hold a really bullish view on this company. I believe that engagement will go up a lot this summer rather than the somewhat expected decline across some media markets that mostly cater to young adults/working adults.

Kids main consumption/engagement in the market is staying in and playing video games since schooling responsibility is gone. Even when school returns, it's a place for kids to congregate and talk about this stuff. 

# Roblox is basically Instagram for kids and Dave Baszucki isn't a FREAK like ZUCKERBORG. Similar jealousy incentives behind Roblox too. Every kid wants to look unique and not like a default baconhead if you know what I mean.

Ive heard Warren say a half a dozen times, 'Its not greed that drives the world, but envy."" - Charlie Munger 

I wrote super epic 10 page DD on Roblox on the long-term view on the  Developer Studio in case this subject is of interest to anyone. But I'm scared to post it because I might get slam dunked by the automod for the 20 billionth time.

And before you say ""oh ya it's so overvalued it's market cap is bigger than X, Y, and Z"" just take a damn moment to consider that the target market is obviously children, of which there are billions of them. These are customers whose core spend include:

1. Eating and staying alive
2. Clothes
3. Toys 
4. Education

Roblox belongs in categories 2, 3, and 4. Legos earns 5 billion in revenue while Blizzard earns 8 billion. Do the math, the company has potential.",ndsgrw,Roblox will be volatile in 2021 due to monthly reporting over quarterly reports.

I REFUSE TO APOLOGIZE FOR THIS!

Guess what fucking state is BETTER THAN CALIFORNIA in wind? MOTHER FUCKING BIG ASS TEXAS, the biggest mother fucking state to ever fucking live, 20% of their energy comes from wind ALREADY, what the fuck are you libtards doing?! TEXAS ALREADY LEAVING YOU IN THE DUST. I broke rule 5, what are you going to do about it, not going to wear a mask in my OWN HOUSE EITHER! Now wind turbines froze up for a bit, but guess what, they can be weather proofed so that shit doesn't happen ever again. They have mother fucking weather proofed wind turbines in Antarctica for fuck sakes.

And this is just the fucking OCEAN TOO! Guess what wind turbines can be put on also instead of water that's fucking right land too and there's plenty of that all the states have it. ^(One thing to note though wind turbines are much more efficient offshore.) Have you looked at the new CS GO MAP DE\_GRIND? THERE'S ALREADY 22 WIND TURBINES ON IT ALREADY, and believe me THEY'RE GOING TO ADD MORE! I CALL VALVE EVERY SINGLE DAMN DAY REQUESTING MORE TURBINES. That has to be a sign right? RIGHT?

And this is only in the fucking US, THERE'S OTHER FUCKING PLACES ALSO GE just partnered with Toshiba. 10 GW OF power buy 2030 1Gw each year in japan! THAT'S A FUCKING TON OF WIND TURBINES, holy shit. Toshiba is going to put a windmill in every single fucking Japan.

No, but its going to have a sweet sweet dividend soon and a nice gradual increase for the years with other boomers flocking to it, yes. I know your portfolio is maybe 3-5% GE but I am going to need you to drain everything you have and make it 100% maybe even 130% GE why?

LOADS OF DEBT being paid off.

Harry Markopolos the guy that caught Bernie Madoff says there's a bunch of fraud. So you know you are really gambling when you buy this stock if he says so. Nobody is trying to squeeze this. If you're a Tesla fanboy this stock probably isn't for you. Tesla and Edison hated each other, does this matter? Probably not, but it makes you wonder.

$8 Billion FREE FLOAT, not all that good BUT I AM USING CAPS, SO GET EXCITED!

$13 something is current price per share ---> 13 is a LUCKY NUMBER.

BILL GATES SAYS %80 wind/solar by 2040 or some shit like that in his book, believe me I read it

Bill Gates also READ Jeff Immelt book believe me I read it on reddit that he read it! he said so himself.

Jeff Immelt also has a tattoo of a fucking meatball on his hip. (previous CEO) Does this matter? Fuck ya it does meatballs are fucking awesome.

If you guys TRULY love risky plays THIS IS FUCKING IT! I don't know if money is going to start coming out of tech and into value, but if it were going to happen, I'd put my money that its going to happen sooner than later.

Every mother fucking state is going to have windmills, 

Once this ball starts to REALLY ROLL its going to ROLL, ROLL straight up that fucking hill and it won't stop, until its down the next hill then ROLLING up the next one then itll roll straight up fucking up MT EVEREST!!!

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

&nbsp;

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, and checking out my socials, it would mean a lot to me! **Happy Trading Everybody! :)**",ne1fla,"Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation (Week 5) - $HD, $WMT, $TGT, $LOW, $CSCO, $GOEV, $XL, $SE and More"

[**Anders Bylund**](https://boards.fool.com/profile/TMFZahrim/info.aspx) **(Nokia):** Few tech stocks have weathered the recent market storm quite like Finnish telecom infrastructure veteran Nokia. The stock has gained 32% since the New Year, including a 14% jump over the last 30 days. By contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is trading flat in 2021 and fell 7% in the last month.

This stock may feel like a joke due to the recent influx of Nokia interest from the Reddit-based WallStreetBets group, but that's just a coincidence. Nokia's real-world business prospects are solid and the stock is actually undervalued, even though it dodged the tech-stock market correction in recent months.

Nokia's solid market position was built on a foundation of [5G network](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) installations. Top-line sales are rising faster than expected, Nokia's profit margin is expanding as we speak thanks to the richer product mix, and the stock is changing hands for less than eight times free cash flow. You don't see that combination of deep-discount stock prices and robust business trends very often, and that makes Nokia a no-brainer buy right now.",ne3k42,Nokia an industry leader in the bargain bin

Home Depot reports earnings premarket 5/18. HD has beat earnings consistently and the share price has reacted negatively each time. In this market I feel like the play here is a strangle. My proposed play is the closest to the money strikes. Right now based on $324 list that would be the 5/21 323.5P/325C. You are in for about $1k. Break even is 3% in either direction. Of course we are hoping for 6% at least.

November earnings was a beat and the stock dropped 6% that day. That would be 100% profit with the trade I propose for educational purposes only. The previous report had a -3.2% drop that day which would still print.

Here is the kicker. The 5 day high is $344 (5/10) and low $317 (5/12) for a 2 day swing of 8.4% bases on Friday close. This is key because it means there is the potential for both sides of the strangle to be profitable prior to expiration! Nuts right?

Here is how to play it. Watch the housing report tomorrow (5/17). With lumber prices being insane new construction might be a miss. If HD stock goes down you will need to consider if the market will price this in when digesting an earnings miss. You will want to wait until the end of the day to enter the strangle to make sure you have strikes that put the Monday close in the middle.

If earnings are a beat and the prices goes up >3% sell the call once you are happy with the profit. Lock in your tuition money because again, this is for education. Same goes for the inverse. Then you have until Friday to try to get tendies with the other side. Can't remember the Vince Vaughn line from Dodge ball but it think it's ""that's what we call the jackpot"".

Not WSB material you say? Earnings plays are inherently gambling and sir, this is a casino.

Positions: none yet. Ask me at 3PM tomorrow you illiterate ape.

TLDR: Home Depot is usually located in  very close proximity to a Wendy's = tendies.

MGM, NCLH, BA, BP are my picks. Each from a different industry, positively impacted by the reopening and ensuing pent-up demand of the economy. I‚Äôm swinging for the MIL on this! 

I‚Äôm a bull here for technical reasons. However, the fundamentals make sense here now as well. The current bull-market trendlines on all the reopen stonks started with a vaccine announcement on November 9th in the early A.M. (the freaking insiders bought/drove up prices before the market opened, that sucked).

The CDC letting ‚Äúvaccinated‚Äù people stop social distancing has majorly positive implications for the economy. Think of traveling, think of the impeding Memorial Day weekend...

Go check out the 1-year, 1-day charts for these stocks, and draw a line from the close on November 6th to now. I think we see 30% or more gains in the value of these stocks the next couple weeks.

The mind and inspiration do not perform like a light switch. If you take inspired, inventive people and constantly force them to perform mediocre tasks to meet mediocre objectives; with sufficient time, you end up with mediocre people. Once you let casual indifference replace intellectual integrity, and complacency take place of inquisitive vigor, deliberate indifference first becomes a habit, and then an ingrained character. Without proper cultivation, talent, and motivation erode quickly and once ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù becomes a collective culture, it is pretty much irreversible. Soon you won't have any potential to tap, just an army of sterile minds only interested in scavenging the next paycheck at the end of the month.

2303,,2021-05-16 14:29:43,t3_ndpiru,,wallstreetbets," The recent NFIB survey suggests we are only in an economic recovery, not an expansion. 

 While the mainstream media overlooks the NFIB data, they really shouldn‚Äôt. There are currently 30.7 million small businesses in the United States[*.*](https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/23142610/2019-Small-Business-Profiles-States-Territories.pdf) Small businesses *(defined as fewer than 500 employees)* **account for 99% of all enterprises, employ 60 million people, and account for nearly 70% of employment.** The chart below shows the breakdown of firms and jobs from the 2019 Census Bureau Data. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zw4426oprhz61.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=5692ffc300115b9a511e1647232fb8032c5f958b

 Let‚Äôs dig in. 

 

### NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w6h4saayrhz61.png?width=907&format=png&auto=webp&s=05dc1256be3e935048e02e19f4c57d0e09cb3e16

 Not surprisingly, given the economy is still struggling with the current recovery,   ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù                               remains extremely weak. 

 The importance of *‚Äúweak confidence‚Äù* also affects the *‚Äúrisk‚Äù* business owners will take concerning capital expenditures, employment, and sales. **Importantly,¬†this is a** ***‚Äúsentiment‚Äù*** **based survey.** Such is a crucial concept to understand as ***‚Äúplanning‚Äù*** **to do something and** ***‚Äúdoing‚Äù*** **it can be very different.** 

 

### An Economic Boom Will Require Participation

Currently, many analysts expect a massive economic boom in 2021. The basis of those expectations is massive *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* demand as the economy reopens.

**I would agree with that expectation had there been no stimulus programs or expanded unemployment benefits.** Those inflows allowed individuals to spend during a recession where such would not usually be the case. Those artificial inputs dragged forward future or *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* consumption into the present.

However, the NFIB survey also suggests much the same.

**Small businesses are susceptible to economic downturns and don‚Äôt have access to public markets for debt or secondary offerings. As such, they tend to focus heavily on operating efficiencies and profitability.**

**If businesses were expecting a massive surge in** ***‚Äúpent up‚Äù*** **demand, they would be doing several things to prepare for it.** Such includes planning to increase capital expenditures to meet expected demand. Unfortunately, those expectations peaked in 2018 and are dropping back to the March 2020 lows.

 

### Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *‚Äúactually‚Äù* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *‚Äúdemand‚Äù* meets its operating cash flows.

To increase employment, which is the single most considerable cost to any business, you need two things:

1. *Confidence the economy is going to continue to grow in the future, which leads to;*
2. *The increase in the production of goods or services requiring increased employment to meet growing demand.*

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

 Businesses understand that the stimulus [***‚Äúpulled forward‚Äù*** ](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***‚Äúcosts‚Äù*** **of** ***‚Äúlong-term employment‚Äù*** **for a** ***‚Äúshort-term‚Äù*** **artificial economic boost.** 

 

### The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.**¬†Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9vqsosfkshz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=d46a184ce87c222fc678ef69b207c8956ba94d17

 

While stimulus may lead to a short-term boost in consumption, the impact of higher taxes, more regulations, and weak employment growth will suppress consumption longer-term.

Despite economic headlines, the recovery of sales for small businesses has been less than *‚Äúbooming.‚Äù*

 

### A Recovery Versus An Expansion

With this background, it is easier to understand why the recent exuberance in chasing small-cap stocks may be premature. **While small-cap companies do historically perform well coming out of recession, the basis was an organic recovery cycle of increasing productivity.**

Currently, the run-up remains the assumption that the stimulus-fueled recovery is sustainable. **Such is only the case if the stimulus becomes a regular benefit and increases in size annually. However, since** [***deficit-based spending is deflationary***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/macroview-a-vaccine-and-the-new-new-normal/)***,***¬†the outcome will fall well short of expectations.

>*‚Äúin 1998, the Federal Reserve ‚Äúcrossed the ‚ÄòRubicon,‚Äô whereby lowering interest rates failed to stimulate economic growth or inflation as the ‚Äòdebt burden‚Äô detracted from it. When compared to the total debt of the economy, monetary velocity shows the problem facing the Fed.‚Äù*

https://preview.redd.it/2budem4qshz61.png?width=1025&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3597e6ad0a525708b14a84e4b20ec242d56f381

 **Such is a critical point as it relates to small-cap companies given their high correlation to small-business confidence.** The correlation between the small-cap index (Russell 2000) and underlying confidence is very high. Given the annual change in ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù is declining, it is not surprising to see that small-cap stocks recently peaked. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1fi4wzptshz61.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a30c19ab1f3f10f823bbcb3eab9b287201d622e

 

### Conclusion

Given that debt-driven government spending programs have a dismal history of providing the economic growth promised, disappointment over the next year is almost a guarantee.

While there are indeed *‚Äúinflationary pressures‚Äù* short-term as the massive infusions, coupled with supply shortages and delivery bottlenecks, higher prices will erode purchasing power. The decline in purchasing power, combined with higher input costs, and potentially higher taxes, will continue to weigh on confidence near term.

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive.

**Most importantly, there is a massive difference between** ***‚Äúgetting back to even‚Äù*** **versus** ***‚Äúgrowing the economy.‚Äù*** **One creates economic prosperity by expanding production, which creates consumption. The other does not.**

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

2305,,2021-05-16 16:33:19,t3_nds2vh,,wallstreetbets,"This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes!

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/4d4qsqg1fiz61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=83455a752058a48e36142935298d3b0975e665eb

GME narrowly edged out PLTR to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. Both the stocks have very similar sentiment due to the wild rides the stock price had this week. AMC also had a significant jump in chatter due to the \~30% rally the stock experienced this week. Newcomers to the top 10 list are UWMC due to their strong Q2 outlook and buyback announcement as well as Alibaba group whose stock took a beating this week but investors are still bullish on the long-term aspects of the company which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/n3f1wc23fiz61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6f1f81111ce5e15f436bf6b3648a6c77e4da3ca)

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Inovio Pharmaceuticals($INO)** was creating chatter mainly due to two reasons. They filed a joint patent with Regeneron($REGN) for treating GBM (a type of severe brain cancer which did not have a cure till now). The trial results look promising and also there have been some unsubstantiated rumors about Regeneron buying out Inovio. Adding to this, they have also completed Phase II trial for their Covid-19 vaccine which showed an excellent immune response. The USP is that the vaccine does not require refrigeration and is cheap to manufacture which makes it ideal for developing countries. Overall investors seem to be extremely bullish on the stock which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Trade Desk($TTD)** stock declined more than 25% on a single day following the company‚Äôs latest earnings report. Even though the company‚Äôs revenue climbed 37% compared to the year-earlier quarter, have kept customer retention rates over 95%, and announced a 10-for-1 stock split, investors did not seem to appreciate the short-term future prospects of the company and were expecting an even bigger beat of estimates. The sell-off can also be partially attributed to ‚ÄúCookie Crisis‚Äù - the traditional way publishers and marketers have collected consumer data ‚Äì through third-party ‚Äúcookies‚Äù ‚Äì is being phased out of the industry due to data privacy and control concerns. This can be an existential crisis for Trade Desk‚Äôs business model. ¬†

**Fubotv ($FUBO)** stock has been highly volatile ever since its IPO in October. The stock spiked as high as $60 but since has fallen to nearly $20. Shares of the company jumped earlier this week due to strong quarterly reports with revenue rising more than 135% and subscriber base doubling from the year-ago quarter. The share price again popped on Friday with the stock finishing up 12.4%.¬†

**Alibaba Group ($BABA)** has been down \~20% last month. Their earnings report also did not help with the company missing the earnings but beat on revenue and annual active consumers. The company‚Äôs earnings were heavily affected by a $2.8 Billion fine imposed by China for Market Regulation. There are mixed opinions from the investing crowd with some believing that the stock is oversold and is undervalued right now vs others believing it‚Äôs not prudent to invest in Chinese stocks.¬†¬†

**UWM holdings ($UWMC)** has been trending due to their quarterly report and the CEO‚Äôs announcement to buy back $300MM of shares. Investors believe that the company‚Äôs share price is at all-time lows and the company having a low PE ratio and a 5.7% dividend yield makes it all the more attractive. The company is also being considered to be added to Russell 1000 in June which can be a short-term catalyst.¬†

SOME FAQ‚Äôs:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

2306,,2021-05-16 16:51:38,t3_ndsgrw,,wallstreetbets,"Sup ya'll. I was reading through Roblox investors relations and thought it was note-worthy that this company is not doing traditional quarterly reports and will instead run with monthly reports as a way to be transparent about company progress with respect to bookings, which is their main financial metric outside and of revenue/engagement/developer share.

I expect that this is going to produce some pretty intense price action. I follow this company closely as both an investor and Roblox developer and thought this strategy was quite interesting.

I personally hold a really bullish view on this company. I believe that engagement will go up a lot this summer rather than the somewhat expected decline across some media markets that mostly cater to young adults/working adults.

Kids main consumption/engagement in the market is staying in and playing video games since schooling responsibility is gone. Even when school returns, it's a place for kids to congregate and talk about this stuff. 

# Roblox is basically Instagram for kids and Dave Baszucki isn't a FREAK like ZUCKERBORG. Similar jealousy incentives behind Roblox too. Every kid wants to look unique and not like a default baconhead if you know what I mean.


> Well, envy/jealousy made, what, two out of the ten commandments? Those of you who have raised siblings you know about envy, or tried to run a law firm or investment bank or even a faculty? Ive heard Warren say a half a dozen times, 'Its not greed that drives the world, but envy."" - Charlie Munger 

I wrote super epic 10 page DD on Roblox on the long-term view on the  Developer Studio in case this subject is of interest to anyone. But I'm scared to post it because I might get slam dunked by the automod for the 20 billionth time.

And before you say ""oh ya it's so overvalued it's market cap is bigger than X, Y, and Z"" just take a damn moment to consider that the target market is obviously children, of which there are billions of them. These are customers whose core spend include:

1. Eating and staying alive
2. Clothes
3. Toys 
4. Education

Roblox belongs in categories 2, 3, and 4. Legos earns 5 billion in revenue while Blizzard earns 8 billion. Do the math, the company has potential.",ndsgrw,Roblox will be volatile in 2021 due to monthly reporting over quarterly reports.

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

&nbsp;

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, and checking out my socials, it would mean a lot to me! **Happy Trading Everybody! :)**",ne1fla,"Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation (Week 5) - $HD, $WMT, $TGT, $LOW, $CSCO, $GOEV, $XL, $SE and More"

[**Anders Bylund**](https://boards.fool.com/profile/TMFZahrim/info.aspx) **(Nokia):** Few tech stocks have weathered the recent market storm quite like Finnish telecom infrastructure veteran Nokia. The stock has gained 32% since the New Year, including a 14% jump over the last 30 days. By contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is trading flat in 2021 and fell 7% in the last month.

This stock may feel like a joke due to the recent influx of Nokia interest from the Reddit-based WallStreetBets group, but that's just a coincidence. Nokia's real-world business prospects are solid and the stock is actually undervalued, even though it dodged the tech-stock market correction in recent months.

Nokia's solid market position was built on a foundation of [5G network](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) installations. Top-line sales are rising faster than expected, Nokia's profit margin is expanding as we speak thanks to the richer product mix, and the stock is changing hands for less than eight times free cash flow. You don't see that combination of deep-discount stock prices and robust business trends very often, and that makes Nokia a no-brainer buy right now.",ne3k42,Nokia an industry leader in the bargain bin

Home Depot reports earnings premarket 5/18. HD has beat earnings consistently and the share price has reacted negatively each time. In this market I feel like the play here is a strangle. My proposed play is the closest to the money strikes. Right now based on $324 list that would be the 5/21 323.5P/325C. You are in for about $1k. Break even is 3% in either direction. Of course we are hoping for 6% at least.

November earnings was a beat and the stock dropped 6% that day. That would be 100% profit with the trade I propose for educational purposes only. The previous report had a -3.2% drop that day which would still print.

Here is the kicker. The 5 day high is $344 (5/10) and low $317 (5/12) for a 2 day swing of 8.4% bases on Friday close. This is key because it means there is the potential for both sides of the strangle to be profitable prior to expiration! Nuts right?

Here is how to play it. Watch the housing report tomorrow (5/17). With lumber prices being insane new construction might be a miss. If HD stock goes down you will need to consider if the market will price this in when digesting an earnings miss. You will want to wait until the end of the day to enter the strangle to make sure you have strikes that put the Monday close in the middle.

If earnings are a beat and the prices goes up >3% sell the call once you are happy with the profit. Lock in your tuition money because again, this is for education. Same goes for the inverse. Then you have until Friday to try to get tendies with the other side. Can't remember the Vince Vaughn line from Dodge ball but it think it's ""that's what we call the jackpot"".

Not WSB material you say? Earnings plays are inherently gambling and sir, this is a casino.

Positions: none yet. Ask me at 3PM tomorrow you illiterate ape.

TLDR: Home Depot is usually located in  very close proximity to a Wendy's = tendies.

Starting at 19 and compounding over your lifespan will definetely bring money but maybe not huge wealth. YOU have to set a plan on what YOU want. What is it that you are aiming at? A retirement account you can comeback to in your 30s-40s and cashout with for a big purchase or are you willing to risk it for that wealth in your 20s. I personally chose the latter with my plan.

Anyway - put 90% of your money in super high yield mutual funds, and then don't look at it.

Third - take that 10% and have some fun. Buy some crypto. F-it. Buy some ada, some doge, some matic. Buy some stocks. Absolutely don't do a fucking thing on margin. 

Fourth - buy everything used. Buy used cars especially.

Fifth - don't date people who don't appreciate your desire in saving money. Always go dutch.

 While the mainstream media overlooks the NFIB data, they really shouldn‚Äôt. There are currently 30.7 million small businesses in the United States[*.*](https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/23142610/2019-Small-Business-Profiles-States-Territories.pdf) Small businesses *(defined as fewer than 500 employees)* **account for 99% of all enterprises, employ 60 million people, and account for nearly 70% of employment.** The chart below shows the breakdown of firms and jobs from the 2019 Census Bureau Data. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zw4426oprhz61.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=5692ffc300115b9a511e1647232fb8032c5f958b

 Let‚Äôs dig in. 

 

### NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w6h4saayrhz61.png?width=907&format=png&auto=webp&s=05dc1256be3e935048e02e19f4c57d0e09cb3e16

 Not surprisingly, given the economy is still struggling with the current recovery,   ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù                               remains extremely weak. 

 The importance of *‚Äúweak confidence‚Äù* also affects the *‚Äúrisk‚Äù* business owners will take concerning capital expenditures, employment, and sales. **Importantly,¬†this is a** ***‚Äúsentiment‚Äù*** **based survey.** Such is a crucial concept to understand as ***‚Äúplanning‚Äù*** **to do something and** ***‚Äúdoing‚Äù*** **it can be very different.** 

 

### An Economic Boom Will Require Participation

Currently, many analysts expect a massive economic boom in 2021. The basis of those expectations is massive *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* demand as the economy reopens.

**I would agree with that expectation had there been no stimulus programs or expanded unemployment benefits.** Those inflows allowed individuals to spend during a recession where such would not usually be the case. Those artificial inputs dragged forward future or *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* consumption into the present.

However, the NFIB survey also suggests much the same.

**Small businesses are susceptible to economic downturns and don‚Äôt have access to public markets for debt or secondary offerings. As such, they tend to focus heavily on operating efficiencies and profitability.**

**If businesses were expecting a massive surge in** ***‚Äúpent up‚Äù*** **demand, they would be doing several things to prepare for it.** Such includes planning to increase capital expenditures to meet expected demand. Unfortunately, those expectations peaked in 2018 and are dropping back to the March 2020 lows.

 

### Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *‚Äúactually‚Äù* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *‚Äúdemand‚Äù* meets its operating cash flows.

To increase employment, which is the single most considerable cost to any business, you need two things:

1. *Confidence the economy is going to continue to grow in the future, which leads to;*
2. *The increase in the production of goods or services requiring increased employment to meet growing demand.*

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qgpd1rqeshz61.png?width=804&format=png&auto=webp&s=cdf5af23ed3d590678c02894f1f43198031bf874

 Businesses understand that the stimulus [***‚Äúpulled forward‚Äù*** ](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***‚Äúcosts‚Äù*** **of** ***‚Äúlong-term employment‚Äù*** **for a** ***‚Äúshort-term‚Äù*** **artificial economic boost.** 

 

### The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.**¬†Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9vqsosfkshz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=d46a184ce87c222fc678ef69b207c8956ba94d17

 

While stimulus may lead to a short-term boost in consumption, the impact of higher taxes, more regulations, and weak employment growth will suppress consumption longer-term.

Despite economic headlines, the recovery of sales for small businesses has been less than *‚Äúbooming.‚Äù*

 

### A Recovery Versus An Expansion

With this background, it is easier to understand why the recent exuberance in chasing small-cap stocks may be premature. **While small-cap companies do historically perform well coming out of recession, the basis was an organic recovery cycle of increasing productivity.**

Currently, the run-up remains the assumption that the stimulus-fueled recovery is sustainable. **Such is only the case if the stimulus becomes a regular benefit and increases in size annually. However, since** [***deficit-based spending is deflationary***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/macroview-a-vaccine-and-the-new-new-normal/)***,***¬†the outcome will fall well short of expectations.

>*‚Äúin 1998, the Federal Reserve ‚Äúcrossed the ‚ÄòRubicon,‚Äô whereby lowering interest rates failed to stimulate economic growth or inflation as the ‚Äòdebt burden‚Äô detracted from it. When compared to the total debt of the economy, monetary velocity shows the problem facing the Fed.‚Äù*

https://preview.redd.it/2budem4qshz61.png?width=1025&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3597e6ad0a525708b14a84e4b20ec242d56f381

 **Such is a critical point as it relates to small-cap companies given their high correlation to small-business confidence.** The correlation between the small-cap index (Russell 2000) and underlying confidence is very high. Given the annual change in ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù is declining, it is not surprising to see that small-cap stocks recently peaked. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1fi4wzptshz61.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a30c19ab1f3f10f823bbcb3eab9b287201d622e

 

### Conclusion

Given that debt-driven government spending programs have a dismal history of providing the economic growth promised, disappointment over the next year is almost a guarantee.

While there are indeed *‚Äúinflationary pressures‚Äù* short-term as the massive infusions, coupled with supply shortages and delivery bottlenecks, higher prices will erode purchasing power. The decline in purchasing power, combined with higher input costs, and potentially higher taxes, will continue to weigh on confidence near term.

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive.

**Most importantly, there is a massive difference between** ***‚Äúgetting back to even‚Äù*** **versus** ***‚Äúgrowing the economy.‚Äù*** **One creates economic prosperity by expanding production, which creates consumption. The other does not.**

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/4d4qsqg1fiz61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=83455a752058a48e36142935298d3b0975e665eb

GME narrowly edged out PLTR to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. Both the stocks have very similar sentiment due to the wild rides the stock price had this week. AMC also had a significant jump in chatter due to the \~30% rally the stock experienced this week. Newcomers to the top 10 list are UWMC due to their strong Q2 outlook and buyback announcement as well as Alibaba group whose stock took a beating this week but investors are still bullish on the long-term aspects of the company which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/n3f1wc23fiz61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6f1f81111ce5e15f436bf6b3648a6c77e4da3ca)

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Inovio Pharmaceuticals($INO)** was creating chatter mainly due to two reasons. They filed a joint patent with Regeneron($REGN) for treating GBM (a type of severe brain cancer which did not have a cure till now). The trial results look promising and also there have been some unsubstantiated rumors about Regeneron buying out Inovio. Adding to this, they have also completed Phase II trial for their Covid-19 vaccine which showed an excellent immune response. The USP is that the vaccine does not require refrigeration and is cheap to manufacture which makes it ideal for developing countries. Overall investors seem to be extremely bullish on the stock which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Trade Desk($TTD)** stock declined more than 25% on a single day following the company‚Äôs latest earnings report. Even though the company‚Äôs revenue climbed 37% compared to the year-earlier quarter, have kept customer retention rates over 95%, and announced a 10-for-1 stock split, investors did not seem to appreciate the short-term future prospects of the company and were expecting an even bigger beat of estimates. The sell-off can also be partially attributed to ‚ÄúCookie Crisis‚Äù - the traditional way publishers and marketers have collected consumer data ‚Äì through third-party ‚Äúcookies‚Äù ‚Äì is being phased out of the industry due to data privacy and control concerns. This can be an existential crisis for Trade Desk‚Äôs business model. ¬†

**Fubotv ($FUBO)** stock has been highly volatile ever since its IPO in October. The stock spiked as high as $60 but since has fallen to nearly $20. Shares of the company jumped earlier this week due to strong quarterly reports with revenue rising more than 135% and subscriber base doubling from the year-ago quarter. The share price again popped on Friday with the stock finishing up 12.4%.¬†

**Alibaba Group ($BABA)** has been down \~20% last month. Their earnings report also did not help with the company missing the earnings but beat on revenue and annual active consumers. The company‚Äôs earnings were heavily affected by a $2.8 Billion fine imposed by China for Market Regulation. There are mixed opinions from the investing crowd with some believing that the stock is oversold and is undervalued right now vs others believing it‚Äôs not prudent to invest in Chinese stocks.¬†¬†

**UWM holdings ($UWMC)** has been trending due to their quarterly report and the CEO‚Äôs announcement to buy back $300MM of shares. Investors believe that the company‚Äôs share price is at all-time lows and the company having a low PE ratio and a 5.7% dividend yield makes it all the more attractive. The company is also being considered to be added to Russell 1000 in June which can be a short-term catalyst.¬†

SOME FAQ‚Äôs:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

2846,,2021-05-16 16:51:38,t3_ndsgrw,,wallstreetbets,"Sup ya'll. I was reading through Roblox investors relations and thought it was note-worthy that this company is not doing traditional quarterly reports and will instead run with monthly reports as a way to be transparent about company progress with respect to bookings, which is their main financial metric outside and of revenue/engagement/developer share.

I expect that this is going to produce some pretty intense price action. I follow this company closely as both an investor and Roblox developer and thought this strategy was quite interesting.

I personally hold a really bullish view on this company. I believe that engagement will go up a lot this summer rather than the somewhat expected decline across some media markets that mostly cater to young adults/working adults.

Kids main consumption/engagement in the market is staying in and playing video games since schooling responsibility is gone. Even when school returns, it's a place for kids to congregate and talk about this stuff. 

# Roblox is basically Instagram for kids and Dave Baszucki isn't a FREAK like ZUCKERBORG. Similar jealousy incentives behind Roblox too. Every kid wants to look unique and not like a default baconhead if you know what I mean.

And before you say ""oh ya it's so overvalued it's market cap is bigger than X, Y, and Z"" just take a damn moment to consider that the target market is obviously children, of which there are billions of them. These are customers whose core spend include:

1. Eating and staying alive
2. Clothes
3. Toys 
4. Education

Roblox belongs in categories 2, 3, and 4. Legos earns 5 billion in revenue while Blizzard earns 8 billion. Do the math, the company has potential.",ndsgrw,Roblox will be volatile in 2021 due to monthly reporting over quarterly reports.

ADDITIVE EVERYTHING

3D PRINTED AIRPLANE ENGINES this is some futuristic next tech tree shit you only see in Starcraft. Is Ge going to be the first to make a battle cruiser? I don't fucking know, are there going to be Zerg, possibly who the fuck knows in this simulation. You think they're going to just stop there and this brings me to my next point. Air travel is going to start to recover bigly soon.

Renewables

WIND TURBINES these things are so fucking optimized, have you seen the Haliade-x 14Mw of Power. Have you been looking at the news, look in Biden's eyes you can practically see the propeller turning, he just approved of the first farm. These bitches are going to be popping up everywhere offshore. There's already 17 wind farms being planned in the Atlantic ocean. 1,500 Wind turbines.

And THATS JUST THE ATLANTIC OCEAN, WHAT ABOUT THE fucking LIBTARD PACIFIC OCEAN? You don't think mother fucking California isn't going to want FUCKING WIND TURBINE ACTION? You might be like kek I thought they wanted to preserve their coast line or some shit. FUCK NO! They're flippy floppy as fuck and power hungry this is going to happen whether you believe it or not. You don't think GAY PEOPLE are going to want wind turbines? If there's one thing I know about gay people its they love things that twirl, believe me I loved watching these things in the pass twirl as a kid, and my mom would call me a faggot all the time. I REFUSE TO APOLOGIZE FOR THIS!

Guess what fucking state is BETTER THAN CALIFORNIA in wind? MOTHER FUCKING BIG ASS TEXAS, the biggest mother fucking state to ever fucking live, 20% of their energy comes from wind ALREADY, what the fuck are you libtards doing?! TEXAS ALREADY LEAVING YOU IN THE DUST. I broke rule 5, what are you going to do about it, not going to wear a mask in my OWN HOUSE EITHER! Now wind turbines froze up for a bit, but guess what, they can be weather proofed so that shit doesn't happen ever again. They have mother fucking weather proofed wind turbines in Antarctica for fuck sakes.

[https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/](https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/)

And this is just the fucking OCEAN TOO! Guess what wind turbines can be put on also instead of water that's fucking right land too and there's plenty of that all the states have it. ^(One thing to note though wind turbines are much more efficient offshore.) Have you looked at the new CS GO MAP DE\_GRIND? THERE'S ALREADY 22 WIND TURBINES ON IT ALREADY, and believe me THEY'RE GOING TO ADD MORE! I CALL VALVE EVERY SINGLE DAMN DAY REQUESTING MORE TURBINES. That has to be a sign right? RIGHT?

And this is only in the fucking US, THERE'S OTHER FUCKING PLACES ALSO GE just partnered with Toshiba. 10 GW OF power buy 2030 1Gw each year in japan! THAT'S A FUCKING TON OF WIND TURBINES, holy shit. Toshiba is going to put a windmill in every single fucking Japan.

No, but its going to have a sweet sweet dividend soon and a nice gradual increase for the years with other boomers flocking to it, yes. I know your portfolio is maybe 3-5% GE but I am going to need you to drain everything you have and make it 100% maybe even 130% GE why?

LOADS OF DEBT being paid off.

Harry Markopolos the guy that caught Bernie Madoff says there's a bunch of fraud. So you know you are really gambling when you buy this stock if he says so. Nobody is trying to squeeze this. If you're a Tesla fanboy this stock probably isn't for you. Tesla and Edison hated each other, does this matter? Probably not, but it makes you wonder.

Bill Gates also READ Jeff Immelt book believe me I read it on reddit that he read it! he said so himself.

Jeff Immelt also has a tattoo of a fucking meatball on his hip. (previous CEO) Does this matter? Fuck ya it does meatballs are fucking awesome.

If you guys TRULY love risky plays THIS IS FUCKING IT! I don't know if money is going to start coming out of tech and into value, but if it were going to happen, I'd put my money that its going to happen sooner than later.

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

&nbsp;

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, and checking out my socials, it would mean a lot to me! **Happy Trading Everybody! :)**",ne1fla,"Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation (Week 5) - $HD, $WMT, $TGT, $LOW, $CSCO, $GOEV, $XL, $SE and More"

[**Anders Bylund**](https://boards.fool.com/profile/TMFZahrim/info.aspx) **(Nokia):** Few tech stocks have weathered the recent market storm quite like Finnish telecom infrastructure veteran Nokia. The stock has gained 32% since the New Year, including a 14% jump over the last 30 days. By contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is trading flat in 2021 and fell 7% in the last month.

This stock may feel like a joke due to the recent influx of Nokia interest from the Reddit-based WallStreetBets group, but that's just a coincidence. Nokia's real-world business prospects are solid and the stock is actually undervalued, even though it dodged the tech-stock market correction in recent months.

Nokia's solid market position was built on a foundation of [5G network](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) installations. Top-line sales are rising faster than expected, Nokia's profit margin is expanding as we speak thanks to the richer product mix, and the stock is changing hands for less than eight times free cash flow. You don't see that combination of deep-discount stock prices and robust business trends very often, and that makes Nokia a no-brainer buy right now.",ne3k42,Nokia an industry leader in the bargain bin

Home Depot reports earnings premarket 5/18. HD has beat earnings consistently and the share price has reacted negatively each time. In this market I feel like the play here is a strangle. My proposed play is the closest to the money strikes. Right now based on $324 list that would be the 5/21 323.5P/325C. You are in for about $1k. Break even is 3% in either direction. Of course we are hoping for 6% at least.

November earnings was a beat and the stock dropped 6% that day. That would be 100% profit with the trade I propose for educational purposes only. The previous report had a -3.2% drop that day which would still print.

Here is the kicker. The 5 day high is $344 (5/10) and low $317 (5/12) for a 2 day swing of 8.4% bases on Friday close. This is key because it means there is the potential for both sides of the strangle to be profitable prior to expiration! Nuts right?

Here is how to play it. Watch the housing report tomorrow (5/17). With lumber prices being insane new construction might be a miss. If HD stock goes down you will need to consider if the market will price this in when digesting an earnings miss. You will want to wait until the end of the day to enter the strangle to make sure you have strikes that put the Monday close in the middle.

If earnings are a beat and the prices goes up >3% sell the call once you are happy with the profit. Lock in your tuition money because again, this is for education. Same goes for the inverse. Then you have until Friday to try to get tendies with the other side. Can't remember the Vince Vaughn line from Dodge ball but it think it's ""that's what we call the jackpot"".

Not WSB material you say? Earnings plays are inherently gambling and sir, this is a casino.

Positions: none yet. Ask me at 3PM tomorrow you illiterate ape.

TLDR: Home Depot is usually located in  very close proximity to a Wendy's = tendies.

But all the info I've dug into leads to me be very fucking confident in the trajectory of how this thing will play out with Nokia's position in the center of growing 5G worldwide.

3035,,2021-05-18 03:08:21,t3_nezmrl,,wallstreetbets,"Inflation hedge is and will be the most importantly topic for both retail and institutional investors for a while given the flooded liquidity and Fed's new ""average inflation targeting"" scheme.

This analysis discusses 1 what does the April CPI data really means, 2) what is the forward looking trend of inflation, 3) why you should be concerned and what you should be doing as investors. 

CPI came out meaningfully above expectation last week. **But is shouldnt be a shock to anyone.** 

\#1 These estimates Dow Jones put together by surveying economists are fucking jokes sometimes. 

\#2 You should take into account the transitory factor of the easy comparison vs. weak inflation of April last year. Let‚Äôs look at the data, CPI was 1.4% last year, assuming 2% is the targeted norm, this means we have a 0.6% easy comparison YoY. Given these, the core CPI this April is more like 2.4% which is not that shocking.   

\#3 Any positive shock in inflation shouldn‚Äôt come as a surprise to you as evidence in inflation pressure has literally shown up everywhere! Except in the official inflation data, ironically‚Ä¶. We heard it from anecdotes, friends, forward looking data, and even on the news. 

&#x200B;

  

**So the takeaway here is that the data shouldn‚Äôt come as a shock to anyone at all.** As we saw, there was some shock to the equity market but it bounced back quickly in the next few days.  While the data itself is not a shock, **I believe inflation will inevitably continue rising and probably surpass current market expectations.**  Reasons are. 

On the demand side, spending growth is skyrocketing in light of rising household income thanks to stimulus checks and pent up demand into continuous reopening. Our best friend Uncle powell will also keep monetary policy super easy under his new ‚ÄúAverage Inflation Targeting‚Äù scheme. I also do not think the US government will be winding down aggressive fiscal supports soon‚Ä¶  Because it is almost free, it supports economic growth And mostly importantly it could effectively deal with inequality issues which have been widening for decades. 

On the supply side, we have already seen a lot of signs of capacity constraints. For example, we already saw these in many commodities whose prices have gone up a lot. Also keep in mind, new capacity for some commodities, especially industrial metals, will take years to come online. At the same time labor growth is not catching up with demand growth for many reasons as reflected in the recent non-farm payroll data. Employers are actually making workers to work longer hours as seen in the data which will eventually turn into higher wages. 

  

Given all these why should you be concerned about inflation? 

**The answer is simple, inflation eventually leads to higher long term interest rate, thus higher discount rate for financial assets like stocks.** This means lower asset prices.

Just to explain a bit more, the impact of inflation on long term interest rate happens through 2 channels. 

\#1 Higher inflation will pressure fed to raise interest rate faster and sooner which will flow to long term rate through rises in forward rates 

\#2 Higher inflation simply means the creditor will demand higher interest payment in order to protect their purchasing power.  

&#x200B;

  

So here comes the most important question, what we could do as investors? 

To be clear. I am NOT saying you should sell all your stocks, because inflation also has a positive growth implication on stocks. Therefore, I am not too sure where the stock is going with inflation. In fact I think there is still some runway in the US stock market which I will explain in another video  And I personally still have meaningful amount of growth stocks. What I am really trying to say is‚Ä¶

As investors who have a lot of stocks, we need to have inflation hedges in our portfolios, which means assets that will do well when inflation rises above market expectations. 

Here are a few options you can do. 

* Buy commodity futures if your accounts can trade those. I personally like future as it gives you a lot of leverage. And leverage is a good thing when you are using it to hedge or diversify your portfolio. You may ask, a lot of commodities have done super well this year‚Ä¶ Am I too late to the game?  My short answer is NO!  If you look at the commodities price curves, most of the rise are led by increases on the short end of the curves. This to some extend signals the gains in commodities so far has been driven by real physical demand instead of speculative activities. So commodities, especially those with inelastic supply, still have some runway to go. **My favorite is copper**. In the near term, copper benefits from the revived home building booms. In the long term, it also benefits from secular trends like electric vehicle adoption and renewable energy infrastructure buildout. As all the wires, transmissions are copper. EV batteries also have meaningful amount of copper. On the supply side, it takes 5-7 years for a new copper mine to come online.As a result, I have **all in‚Äôed copper futures**, with diamond hands, no way back, no questions asked.
* You can also short bond futures given the positive relation between inflation and nominal yield. If you are really fancy and want purer exposure, you can also buy inflation-linked bonds and short nominal bonds, keeping dollar duration neutral. It seems these options so far may not be too friendly to retail investors. Don‚Äôt worry, the following ones will be better. 
* Next, you can easily buy commodity ETFs. For example SLV for silver, IAU/GLD for gold, CPER for copper, DBB/DBC/GSG for diversified commodities. And I am sure you can find a bunch of oil ETFs but I personally don‚Äôt like oil as an investment at this point so go find them yourself. Among these, I like silver, it has industrial usage, exposure to high tech and green economy, and mostly importantly the precious metal wealth preservation attribute. It also could also go to moon in light of #SilverSqueeze‚Ä¶. We shall see. 
* Next option, you can invest in stocks of miners, and I have listed down a few as examples for you. e.g. FCX (copper). Vale (Nickle and others) I am sure you can find more. Pros, these miners could do really well in industrial metal upcycles  Cons, you are also exposed to their operational risks.  To be honest, the operational track record of this group is definitely not the greatest so do your own fundamental due diligence before investing.
* Next, you can also buy inflation protection ETFs, like TIP. These are conservative and offers inflation hedges.  However, it may not the best option for hedging in light of the intrinsic low volatility of these products. Because, lower the volatility, less effective the hedging will be, which I will explain in another video.
* Last but not the least. Cryptocurrencies. Most of the Cryptocurrencies have the wealth preservation attribute due to limited supply.  However, you are most definitely introducing more idiosyncratic risks to your portfolio by investing in Cryptocurrencies. 

**TLDR: if you hold stocks, you need inflation hedges, you can buy commodity futures, short bonds, buy SLV/CPER/GLD/FCX/Cryptocurrencies**

**I am a hedgefund professional, actually made a video about this, hope you can subscribe and support if you like what you see/hear:**

3183,,2021-05-16 14:29:43,t3_ndpiru,,wallstreetbets," The recent NFIB survey suggests we are only in an economic recovery, not an expansion. 

 While the mainstream media overlooks the NFIB data, they really shouldn‚Äôt. There are currently 30.7 million small businesses in the United States[*.*](https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/23142610/2019-Small-Business-Profiles-States-Territories.pdf) Small businesses *(defined as fewer than 500 employees)* **account for 99% of all enterprises, employ 60 million people, and account for nearly 70% of employment.** The chart below shows the breakdown of firms and jobs from the 2019 Census Bureau Data. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zw4426oprhz61.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=5692ffc300115b9a511e1647232fb8032c5f958b

 Let‚Äôs dig in. 

 

### NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w6h4saayrhz61.png?width=907&format=png&auto=webp&s=05dc1256be3e935048e02e19f4c57d0e09cb3e16

 Not surprisingly, given the economy is still struggling with the current recovery,   ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù                               remains extremely weak. 

 The importance of *‚Äúweak confidence‚Äù* also affects the *‚Äúrisk‚Äù* business owners will take concerning capital expenditures, employment, and sales. **Importantly,¬†this is a** ***‚Äúsentiment‚Äù*** **based survey.** Such is a crucial concept to understand as ***‚Äúplanning‚Äù*** **to do something and** ***‚Äúdoing‚Äù*** **it can be very different.** 

 

### An Economic Boom Will Require Participation

Currently, many analysts expect a massive economic boom in 2021. The basis of those expectations is massive *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* demand as the economy reopens.

**I would agree with that expectation had there been no stimulus programs or expanded unemployment benefits.** Those inflows allowed individuals to spend during a recession where such would not usually be the case. Those artificial inputs dragged forward future or *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* consumption into the present.

However, the NFIB survey also suggests much the same.

**Small businesses are susceptible to economic downturns and don‚Äôt have access to public markets for debt or secondary offerings. As such, they tend to focus heavily on operating efficiencies and profitability.**

**If businesses were expecting a massive surge in** ***‚Äúpent up‚Äù*** **demand, they would be doing several things to prepare for it.** Such includes planning to increase capital expenditures to meet expected demand. Unfortunately, those expectations peaked in 2018 and are dropping back to the March 2020 lows.

 

### Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *‚Äúactually‚Äù* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *‚Äúdemand‚Äù* meets its operating cash flows.

To increase employment, which is the single most considerable cost to any business, you need two things:

1. *Confidence the economy is going to continue to grow in the future, which leads to;*
2. *The increase in the production of goods or services requiring increased employment to meet growing demand.*

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

 Businesses understand that the stimulus [***‚Äúpulled forward‚Äù*** ](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***‚Äúcosts‚Äù*** **of** ***‚Äúlong-term employment‚Äù*** **for a** ***‚Äúshort-term‚Äù*** **artificial economic boost.** 

 

### The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.**¬†Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9vqsosfkshz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=d46a184ce87c222fc678ef69b207c8956ba94d17

 

While stimulus may lead to a short-term boost in consumption, the impact of higher taxes, more regulations, and weak employment growth will suppress consumption longer-term.

Despite economic headlines, the recovery of sales for small businesses has been less than *‚Äúbooming.‚Äù*

 

### A Recovery Versus An Expansion

With this background, it is easier to understand why the recent exuberance in chasing small-cap stocks may be premature. **While small-cap companies do historically perform well coming out of recession, the basis was an organic recovery cycle of increasing productivity.**

Currently, the run-up remains the assumption that the stimulus-fueled recovery is sustainable. **Such is only the case if the stimulus becomes a regular benefit and increases in size annually. However, since** [***deficit-based spending is deflationary***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/macroview-a-vaccine-and-the-new-new-normal/)***,***¬†the outcome will fall well short of expectations.

>*‚Äúin 1998, the Federal Reserve ‚Äúcrossed the ‚ÄòRubicon,‚Äô whereby lowering interest rates failed to stimulate economic growth or inflation as the ‚Äòdebt burden‚Äô detracted from it. When compared to the total debt of the economy, monetary velocity shows the problem facing the Fed.‚Äù*

https://preview.redd.it/2budem4qshz61.png?width=1025&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3597e6ad0a525708b14a84e4b20ec242d56f381

 **Such is a critical point as it relates to small-cap companies given their high correlation to small-business confidence.** The correlation between the small-cap index (Russell 2000) and underlying confidence is very high. Given the annual change in ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù is declining, it is not surprising to see that small-cap stocks recently peaked. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1fi4wzptshz61.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a30c19ab1f3f10f823bbcb3eab9b287201d622e

 

### Conclusion

Given that debt-driven government spending programs have a dismal history of providing the economic growth promised, disappointment over the next year is almost a guarantee.

While there are indeed *‚Äúinflationary pressures‚Äù* short-term as the massive infusions, coupled with supply shortages and delivery bottlenecks, higher prices will erode purchasing power. The decline in purchasing power, combined with higher input costs, and potentially higher taxes, will continue to weigh on confidence near term.

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive.

**Most importantly, there is a massive difference between** ***‚Äúgetting back to even‚Äù*** **versus** ***‚Äúgrowing the economy.‚Äù*** **One creates economic prosperity by expanding production, which creates consumption. The other does not.**

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/4d4qsqg1fiz61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=83455a752058a48e36142935298d3b0975e665eb

GME narrowly edged out PLTR to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. Both the stocks have very similar sentiment due to the wild rides the stock price had this week. AMC also had a significant jump in chatter due to the \~30% rally the stock experienced this week. Newcomers to the top 10 list are UWMC due to their strong Q2 outlook and buyback announcement as well as Alibaba group whose stock took a beating this week but investors are still bullish on the long-term aspects of the company which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/n3f1wc23fiz61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6f1f81111ce5e15f436bf6b3648a6c77e4da3ca)

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Inovio Pharmaceuticals($INO)** was creating chatter mainly due to two reasons. They filed a joint patent with Regeneron($REGN) for treating GBM (a type of severe brain cancer which did not have a cure till now). The trial results look promising and also there have been some unsubstantiated rumors about Regeneron buying out Inovio. Adding to this, they have also completed Phase II trial for their Covid-19 vaccine which showed an excellent immune response. The USP is that the vaccine does not require refrigeration and is cheap to manufacture which makes it ideal for developing countries. Overall investors seem to be extremely bullish on the stock which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Trade Desk($TTD)** stock declined more than 25% on a single day following the company‚Äôs latest earnings report. Even though the company‚Äôs revenue climbed 37% compared to the year-earlier quarter, have kept customer retention rates over 95%, and announced a 10-for-1 stock split, investors did not seem to appreciate the short-term future prospects of the company and were expecting an even bigger beat of estimates. The sell-off can also be partially attributed to ‚ÄúCookie Crisis‚Äù - the traditional way publishers and marketers have collected consumer data ‚Äì through third-party ‚Äúcookies‚Äù ‚Äì is being phased out of the industry due to data privacy and control concerns. This can be an existential crisis for Trade Desk‚Äôs business model. ¬†

**Fubotv ($FUBO)** stock has been highly volatile ever since its IPO in October. The stock spiked as high as $60 but since has fallen to nearly $20. Shares of the company jumped earlier this week due to strong quarterly reports with revenue rising more than 135% and subscriber base doubling from the year-ago quarter. The share price again popped on Friday with the stock finishing up 12.4%.¬†

**Alibaba Group ($BABA)** has been down \~20% last month. Their earnings report also did not help with the company missing the earnings but beat on revenue and annual active consumers. The company‚Äôs earnings were heavily affected by a $2.8 Billion fine imposed by China for Market Regulation. There are mixed opinions from the investing crowd with some believing that the stock is oversold and is undervalued right now vs others believing it‚Äôs not prudent to invest in Chinese stocks.¬†¬†

**UWM holdings ($UWMC)** has been trending due to their quarterly report and the CEO‚Äôs announcement to buy back $300MM of shares. Investors believe that the company‚Äôs share price is at all-time lows and the company having a low PE ratio and a 5.7% dividend yield makes it all the more attractive. The company is also being considered to be added to Russell 1000 in June which can be a short-term catalyst.¬†

SOME FAQ‚Äôs:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

3186,,2021-05-16 16:51:38,t3_ndsgrw,,wallstreetbets,"Sup ya'll. I was reading through Roblox investors relations and thought it was note-worthy that this company is not doing traditional quarterly reports and will instead run with monthly reports as a way to be transparent about company progress with respect to bookings, which is their main financial metric outside and of revenue/engagement/developer share.

I expect that this is going to produce some pretty intense price action. I follow this company closely as both an investor and Roblox developer and thought this strategy was quite interesting.

I personally hold a really bullish view on this company. I believe that engagement will go up a lot this summer rather than the somewhat expected decline across some media markets that mostly cater to young adults/working adults.

Kids main consumption/engagement in the market is staying in and playing video games since schooling responsibility is gone. Even when school returns, it's a place for kids to congregate and talk about this stuff. 

# Roblox is basically Instagram for kids and Dave Baszucki isn't a FREAK like ZUCKERBORG. Similar jealousy incentives behind Roblox too. Every kid wants to look unique and not like a default baconhead if you know what I mean.


> Well, envy/jealousy made, what, two out of the ten commandments? Those of you who have raised siblings you know about envy, or tried to run a law firm or investment bank or even a faculty? Ive heard Warren say a half a dozen times, 'Its not greed that drives the world, but envy."" - Charlie Munger 

I wrote super epic 10 page DD on Roblox on the long-term view on the  Developer Studio in case this subject is of interest to anyone. But I'm scared to post it because I might get slam dunked by the automod for the 20 billionth time.

And before you say ""oh ya it's so overvalued it's market cap is bigger than X, Y, and Z"" just take a damn moment to consider that the target market is obviously children, of which there are billions of them. These are customers whose core spend include:

1. Eating and staying alive
2. Clothes
3. Toys 
4. Education

Roblox belongs in categories 2, 3, and 4. Legos earns 5 billion in revenue while Blizzard earns 8 billion. Do the math, the company has potential.",ndsgrw,Roblox will be volatile in 2021 due to monthly reporting over quarterly reports.

And there's so so so much other fucking cool ass shit that GE does, these bitches can make a train did you fucking know that? How bout all the medical tech stuff? They just released a new portable baby scanner.

LOADS OF DEBT being paid off.

Harry Markopolos the guy that caught Bernie Madoff says there's a bunch of fraud. So you know you are really gambling when you buy this stock if he says so. Nobody is trying to squeeze this. If you're a Tesla fanboy this stock probably isn't for you. Tesla and Edison hated each other, does this matter? Probably not, but it makes you wonder.

$8 Billion FREE FLOAT, not all that good BUT I AM USING CAPS, SO GET EXCITED!

$13 something is current price per share ---> 13 is a LUCKY NUMBER.

BILL GATES SAYS %80 wind/solar by 2040 or some shit like that in his book, believe me I read it

Bill Gates also READ Jeff Immelt book believe me I read it on reddit that he read it! he said so himself.

Jeff Immelt also has a tattoo of a fucking meatball on his hip. (previous CEO) Does this matter? Fuck ya it does meatballs are fucking awesome.

If you guys TRULY love risky plays THIS IS FUCKING IT! I don't know if money is going to start coming out of tech and into value, but if it were going to happen, I'd put my money that its going to happen sooner than later.

Every mother fucking state is going to have windmills, 

Once this ball starts to REALLY ROLL its going to ROLL, ROLL straight up that fucking hill and it won't stop, until its down the next hill then ROLLING up the next one then itll roll straight up fucking up MT EVEREST!!!

I AM WAVING THE FUCKING AMERICAN GOD DAMN FLAG RIGHT NOW ALERTING all of you like PAUL f'ing REVERE. 

If you hate the thought of America creating more job then don't buy. 

If you don't buy GE then you must hate America.  Why do you hate America so much?",ndxk81,"Serious discussion, no seriously please about GE. I know you hate it. Real Financial advice at the tippy top."

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

&nbsp;

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

&nbsp;

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, and checking out my socials, it would mean a lot to me! **Happy Trading Everybody! :)**",ne1fla,"Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation (Week 5) - $HD, $WMT, $TGT, $LOW, $CSCO, $GOEV, $XL, $SE and More"

[**Anders Bylund**](https://boards.fool.com/profile/TMFZahrim/info.aspx) **(Nokia):** Few tech stocks have weathered the recent market storm quite like Finnish telecom infrastructure veteran Nokia. The stock has gained 32% since the New Year, including a 14% jump over the last 30 days. By contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is trading flat in 2021 and fell 7% in the last month.

This stock may feel like a joke due to the recent influx of Nokia interest from the Reddit-based WallStreetBets group, but that's just a coincidence. Nokia's real-world business prospects are solid and the stock is actually undervalued, even though it dodged the tech-stock market correction in recent months.

Nokia's solid market position was built on a foundation of [5G network](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) installations. Top-line sales are rising faster than expected, Nokia's profit margin is expanding as we speak thanks to the richer product mix, and the stock is changing hands for less than eight times free cash flow. You don't see that combination of deep-discount stock prices and robust business trends very often, and that makes Nokia a no-brainer buy right now.",ne3k42,Nokia an industry leader in the bargain bin

I don't mean disrespect, but it feels like that's exactly what you're doing.  You could've drawn that flag with any of those candles and you chose the two that produced a breakout today.

Ignore the May data, pretend we're still in April, and draw the lines again.  We get a flag that should've had a big breakout already, except it didn't, because breakout flags don't matter on a heavily manipulated stock.

I don't know what that red line represents but it starts on a candle that is the result of an illegal trading halt.  That's not good data for TA.

3514,,2021-05-16 14:29:43,t3_ndpiru,,wallstreetbets," The recent NFIB survey suggests we are only in an economic recovery, not an expansion. 

 While the mainstream media overlooks the NFIB data, they really shouldn‚Äôt. There are currently 30.7 million small businesses in the United States[*.*](https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/23142610/2019-Small-Business-Profiles-States-Territories.pdf) Small businesses *(defined as fewer than 500 employees)* **account for 99% of all enterprises, employ 60 million people, and account for nearly 70% of employment.** The chart below shows the breakdown of firms and jobs from the 2019 Census Bureau Data. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zw4426oprhz61.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=5692ffc300115b9a511e1647232fb8032c5f958b

 Let‚Äôs dig in. 

 

### NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w6h4saayrhz61.png?width=907&format=png&auto=webp&s=05dc1256be3e935048e02e19f4c57d0e09cb3e16

 Not surprisingly, given the economy is still struggling with the current recovery,   ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù                               remains extremely weak. 

 The importance of *‚Äúweak confidence‚Äù* also affects the *‚Äúrisk‚Äù* business owners will take concerning capital expenditures, employment, and sales. **Importantly,¬†this is a** ***‚Äúsentiment‚Äù*** **based survey.** Such is a crucial concept to understand as ***‚Äúplanning‚Äù*** **to do something and** ***‚Äúdoing‚Äù*** **it can be very different.** 

 

### An Economic Boom Will Require Participation

Currently, many analysts expect a massive economic boom in 2021. The basis of those expectations is massive *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* demand as the economy reopens.

**I would agree with that expectation had there been no stimulus programs or expanded unemployment benefits.** Those inflows allowed individuals to spend during a recession where such would not usually be the case. Those artificial inputs dragged forward future or *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* consumption into the present.

However, the NFIB survey also suggests much the same.

**Small businesses are susceptible to economic downturns and don‚Äôt have access to public markets for debt or secondary offerings. As such, they tend to focus heavily on operating efficiencies and profitability.**

**If businesses were expecting a massive surge in** ***‚Äúpent up‚Äù*** **demand, they would be doing several things to prepare for it.** Such includes planning to increase capital expenditures to meet expected demand. Unfortunately, those expectations peaked in 2018 and are dropping back to the March 2020 lows.

 

### Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *‚Äúactually‚Äù* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *‚Äúdemand‚Äù* meets its operating cash flows.

To increase employment, which is the single most considerable cost to any business, you need two things:

1. *Confidence the economy is going to continue to grow in the future, which leads to;*
2. *The increase in the production of goods or services requiring increased employment to meet growing demand.*

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

&#x200B;

 Businesses understand that the stimulus [***‚Äúpulled forward‚Äù*** ](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***‚Äúcosts‚Äù*** **of** ***‚Äúlong-term employment‚Äù*** **for a** ***‚Äúshort-term‚Äù*** **artificial economic boost.** 

 

### The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.**¬†Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9vqsosfkshz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=d46a184ce87c222fc678ef69b207c8956ba94d17

 

While stimulus may lead to a short-term boost in consumption, the impact of higher taxes, more regulations, and weak employment growth will suppress consumption longer-term.

Despite economic headlines, the recovery of sales for small businesses has been less than *‚Äúbooming.‚Äù*

 

### A Recovery Versus An Expansion

With this background, it is easier to understand why the recent exuberance in chasing small-cap stocks may be premature. **While small-cap companies do historically perform well coming out of recession, the basis was an organic recovery cycle of increasing productivity.**

Currently, the run-up remains the assumption that the stimulus-fueled recovery is sustainable. **Such is only the case if the stimulus becomes a regular benefit and increases in size annually. However, since** [***deficit-based spending is deflationary***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/macroview-a-vaccine-and-the-new-new-normal/)***,***¬†the outcome will fall well short of expectations.

>*‚Äúin 1998, the Federal Reserve ‚Äúcrossed the ‚ÄòRubicon,‚Äô whereby lowering interest rates failed to stimulate economic growth or inflation as the ‚Äòdebt burden‚Äô detracted from it. When compared to the total debt of the economy, monetary velocity shows the problem facing the Fed.‚Äù*

https://preview.redd.it/2budem4qshz61.png?width=1025&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3597e6ad0a525708b14a84e4b20ec242d56f381

 **Such is a critical point as it relates to small-cap companies given their high correlation to small-business confidence.** The correlation between the small-cap index (Russell 2000) and underlying confidence is very high. Given the annual change in ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù is declining, it is not surprising to see that small-cap stocks recently peaked. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1fi4wzptshz61.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a30c19ab1f3f10f823bbcb3eab9b287201d622e

 

### Conclusion

Given that debt-driven government spending programs have a dismal history of providing the economic growth promised, disappointment over the next year is almost a guarantee.

While there are indeed *‚Äúinflationary pressures‚Äù* short-term as the massive infusions, coupled with supply shortages and delivery bottlenecks, higher prices will erode purchasing power. The decline in purchasing power, combined with higher input costs, and potentially higher taxes, will continue to weigh on confidence near term.

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive.

**Most importantly, there is a massive difference between** ***‚Äúgetting back to even‚Äù*** **versus** ***‚Äúgrowing the economy.‚Äù*** **One creates economic prosperity by expanding production, which creates consumption. The other does not.**

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

3516,,2021-05-16 16:33:19,t3_nds2vh,,wallstreetbets,"This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes!

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/4d4qsqg1fiz61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=83455a752058a48e36142935298d3b0975e665eb

GME narrowly edged out PLTR to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. Both the stocks have very similar sentiment due to the wild rides the stock price had this week. AMC also had a significant jump in chatter due to the \~30% rally the stock experienced this week. Newcomers to the top 10 list are UWMC due to their strong Q2 outlook and buyback announcement as well as Alibaba group whose stock took a beating this week but investors are still bullish on the long-term aspects of the company which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/n3f1wc23fiz61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6f1f81111ce5e15f436bf6b3648a6c77e4da3ca)

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Inovio Pharmaceuticals($INO)** was creating chatter mainly due to two reasons. They filed a joint patent with Regeneron($REGN) for treating GBM (a type of severe brain cancer which did not have a cure till now). The trial results look promising and also there have been some unsubstantiated rumors about Regeneron buying out Inovio. Adding to this, they have also completed Phase II trial for their Covid-19 vaccine which showed an excellent immune response. The USP is that the vaccine does not require refrigeration and is cheap to manufacture which makes it ideal for developing countries. Overall investors seem to be extremely bullish on the stock which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Trade Desk($TTD)** stock declined more than 25% on a single day following the company‚Äôs latest earnings report. Even though the company‚Äôs revenue climbed 37% compared to the year-earlier quarter, have kept customer retention rates over 95%, and announced a 10-for-1 stock split, investors did not seem to appreciate the short-term future prospects of the company and were expecting an even bigger beat of estimates. The sell-off can also be partially attributed to ‚ÄúCookie Crisis‚Äù - the traditional way publishers and marketers have collected consumer data ‚Äì through third-party ‚Äúcookies‚Äù ‚Äì is being phased out of the industry due to data privacy and control concerns. This can be an existential crisis for Trade Desk‚Äôs business model. ¬†

**Fubotv ($FUBO)** stock has been highly volatile ever since its IPO in October. The stock spiked as high as $60 but since has fallen to nearly $20. Shares of the company jumped earlier this week due to strong quarterly reports with revenue rising more than 135% and subscriber base doubling from the year-ago quarter. The share price again popped on Friday with the stock finishing up 12.4%.¬†

**Alibaba Group ($BABA)** has been down \~20% last month. Their earnings report also did not help with the company missing the earnings but beat on revenue and annual active consumers. The company‚Äôs earnings were heavily affected by a $2.8 Billion fine imposed by China for Market Regulation. There are mixed opinions from the investing crowd with some believing that the stock is oversold and is undervalued right now vs others believing it‚Äôs not prudent to invest in Chinese stocks.¬†¬†

**UWM holdings ($UWMC)** has been trending due to their quarterly report and the CEO‚Äôs announcement to buy back $300MM of shares. Investors believe that the company‚Äôs share price is at all-time lows and the company having a low PE ratio and a 5.7% dividend yield makes it all the more attractive. The company is also being considered to be added to Russell 1000 in June which can be a short-term catalyst.¬†

SOME FAQ‚Äôs:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

3517,,2021-05-16 16:51:38,t3_ndsgrw,,wallstreetbets,"Sup ya'll. I was reading through Roblox investors relations and thought it was note-worthy that this company is not doing traditional quarterly reports and will instead run with monthly reports as a way to be transparent about company progress with respect to bookings, which is their main financial metric outside and of revenue/engagement/developer share.

I expect that this is going to produce some pretty intense price action. I follow this company closely as both an investor and Roblox developer and thought this strategy was quite interesting.

I personally hold a really bullish view on this company. I believe that engagement will go up a lot this summer rather than the somewhat expected decline across some media markets that mostly cater to young adults/working adults.

Kids main consumption/engagement in the market is staying in and playing video games since schooling responsibility is gone. Even when school returns, it's a place for kids to congregate and talk about this stuff. 

# Roblox is basically Instagram for kids and Dave Baszucki isn't a FREAK like ZUCKERBORG. Similar jealousy incentives behind Roblox too. Every kid wants to look unique and not like a default baconhead if you know what I mean.

And before you say ""oh ya it's so overvalued it's market cap is bigger than X, Y, and Z"" just take a damn moment to consider that the target market is obviously children, of which there are billions of them. These are customers whose core spend include:

1. Eating and staying alive
2. Clothes
3. Toys 
4. Education

Roblox belongs in categories 2, 3, and 4. Legos earns 5 billion in revenue while Blizzard earns 8 billion. Do the math, the company has potential.",ndsgrw,Roblox will be volatile in 2021 due to monthly reporting over quarterly reports.

ADDITIVE EVERYTHING

3D PRINTED AIRPLANE ENGINES this is some futuristic next tech tree shit you only see in Starcraft. Is Ge going to be the first to make a battle cruiser? I don't fucking know, are there going to be Zerg, possibly who the fuck knows in this simulation. You think they're going to just stop there and this brings me to my next point. Air travel is going to start to recover bigly soon.

Renewables

WIND TURBINES these things are so fucking optimized, have you seen the Haliade-x 14Mw of Power. Have you been looking at the news, look in Biden's eyes you can practically see the propeller turning, he just approved of the first farm. These bitches are going to be popping up everywhere offshore. There's already 17 wind farms being planned in the Atlantic ocean. 1,500 Wind turbines.

And THATS JUST THE ATLANTIC OCEAN, WHAT ABOUT THE fucking LIBTARD PACIFIC OCEAN? You don't think mother fucking California isn't going to want FUCKING WIND TURBINE ACTION? You might be like kek I thought they wanted to preserve their coast line or some shit. FUCK NO! They're flippy floppy as fuck and power hungry this is going to happen whether you believe it or not. You don't think GAY PEOPLE are going to want wind turbines? If there's one thing I know about gay people its they love things that twirl, believe me I loved watching these things in the pass twirl as a kid, and my mom would call me a faggot all the time. I REFUSE TO APOLOGIZE FOR THIS!

Guess what fucking state is BETTER THAN CALIFORNIA in wind? MOTHER FUCKING BIG ASS TEXAS, the biggest mother fucking state to ever fucking live, 20% of their energy comes from wind ALREADY, what the fuck are you libtards doing?! TEXAS ALREADY LEAVING YOU IN THE DUST. I broke rule 5, what are you going to do about it, not going to wear a mask in my OWN HOUSE EITHER! Now wind turbines froze up for a bit, but guess what, they can be weather proofed so that shit doesn't happen ever again. They have mother fucking weather proofed wind turbines in Antarctica for fuck sakes.

[https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/](https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/)

And this is just the fucking OCEAN TOO! Guess what wind turbines can be put on also instead of water that's fucking right land too and there's plenty of that all the states have it. ^(One thing to note though wind turbines are much more efficient offshore.) Have you looked at the new CS GO MAP DE\_GRIND? THERE'S ALREADY 22 WIND TURBINES ON IT ALREADY, and believe me THEY'RE GOING TO ADD MORE! I CALL VALVE EVERY SINGLE DAMN DAY REQUESTING MORE TURBINES. That has to be a sign right? RIGHT?

And this is only in the fucking US, THERE'S OTHER FUCKING PLACES ALSO GE just partnered with Toshiba. 10 GW OF power buy 2030 1Gw each year in japan! THAT'S A FUCKING TON OF WIND TURBINES, holy shit. Toshiba is going to put a windmill in every single fucking Japan.

No, but its going to have a sweet sweet dividend soon and a nice gradual increase for the years with other boomers flocking to it, yes. I know your portfolio is maybe 3-5% GE but I am going to need you to drain everything you have and make it 100% maybe even 130% GE why?

And there's so so so much other fucking cool ass shit that GE does, these bitches can make a train did you fucking know that? How bout all the medical tech stuff? They just released a new portable baby scanner.

LOADS OF DEBT being paid off.

Harry Markopolos the guy that caught Bernie Madoff says there's a bunch of fraud. So you know you are really gambling when you buy this stock if he says so. Nobody is trying to squeeze this. If you're a Tesla fanboy this stock probably isn't for you. Tesla and Edison hated each other, does this matter? Probably not, but it makes you wonder.

$8 Billion FREE FLOAT, not all that good BUT I AM USING CAPS, SO GET EXCITED!

BILL GATES SAYS %80 wind/solar by 2040 or some shit like that in his book, believe me I read it

Bill Gates also READ Jeff Immelt book believe me I read it on reddit that he read it! he said so himself.

Jeff Immelt also has a tattoo of a fucking meatball on his hip. (previous CEO) Does this matter? Fuck ya it does meatballs are fucking awesome.

If you guys TRULY love risky plays THIS IS FUCKING IT! I don't know if money is going to start coming out of tech and into value, but if it were going to happen, I'd put my money that its going to happen sooner than later.

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

&nbsp;

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, and checking out my socials, it would mean a lot to me! **Happy Trading Everybody! :)**",ne1fla,"Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation (Week 5) - $HD, $WMT, $TGT, $LOW, $CSCO, $GOEV, $XL, $SE and More"

[**Anders Bylund**](https://boards.fool.com/profile/TMFZahrim/info.aspx) **(Nokia):** Few tech stocks have weathered the recent market storm quite like Finnish telecom infrastructure veteran Nokia. The stock has gained 32% since the New Year, including a 14% jump over the last 30 days. By contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is trading flat in 2021 and fell 7% in the last month.

This stock may feel like a joke due to the recent influx of Nokia interest from the Reddit-based WallStreetBets group, but that's just a coincidence. Nokia's real-world business prospects are solid and the stock is actually undervalued, even though it dodged the tech-stock market correction in recent months.

Nokia's solid market position was built on a foundation of [5G network](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) installations. Top-line sales are rising faster than expected, Nokia's profit margin is expanding as we speak thanks to the richer product mix, and the stock is changing hands for less than eight times free cash flow. You don't see that combination of deep-discount stock prices and robust business trends very often, and that makes Nokia a no-brainer buy right now.",ne3k42,Nokia an industry leader in the bargain bin

Home Depot reports earnings premarket 5/18. HD has beat earnings consistently and the share price has reacted negatively each time. In this market I feel like the play here is a strangle. My proposed play is the closest to the money strikes. Right now based on $324 list that would be the 5/21 323.5P/325C. You are in for about $1k. Break even is 3% in either direction. Of course we are hoping for 6% at least.

November earnings was a beat and the stock dropped 6% that day. That would be 100% profit with the trade I propose for educational purposes only. The previous report had a -3.2% drop that day which would still print.

Here is the kicker. The 5 day high is $344 (5/10) and low $317 (5/12) for a 2 day swing of 8.4% bases on Friday close. This is key because it means there is the potential for both sides of the strangle to be profitable prior to expiration! Nuts right?

Here is how to play it. Watch the housing report tomorrow (5/17). With lumber prices being insane new construction might be a miss. If HD stock goes down you will need to consider if the market will price this in when digesting an earnings miss. You will want to wait until the end of the day to enter the strangle to make sure you have strikes that put the Monday close in the middle.

If earnings are a beat and the prices goes up >3% sell the call once you are happy with the profit. Lock in your tuition money because again, this is for education. Same goes for the inverse. Then you have until Friday to try to get tendies with the other side. Can't remember the Vince Vaughn line from Dodge ball but it think it's ""that's what we call the jackpot"".

Not WSB material you say? Earnings plays are inherently gambling and sir, this is a casino.

Positions: none yet. Ask me at 3PM tomorrow you illiterate ape.

TLDR: Home Depot is usually located in  very close proximity to a Wendy's = tendies.

Are most people thinking 'I must build my deck now becasue next year lumber will be twice the price again'  or 'I'll wait and do it next year'.  


Obviously some are/have been thinking 'I have time now, I will pay the prices and do it now', but that is transitory.  


My point is that inflation occurs when the masses buy everything they can now becasue they know they will pay more in the future.  That is not happening.  In fact back deposits have been increasing significantly.  That is not inflationary.  


People saying the Fed is just printing money are being misleading at best and really just downright wrong at worst.  In addition, the government spending borrowed money has never been more than transitory as far as inflation is concerned becasue in the end the debt load is disinflationary.  


I hear youtubers say something like 25% of all dollars printed have been printed in the last year.  Well, they are very much misusing the word 'printed'.  Those dollars are not in circulation, they are tied up in the banking system.  How do they get released?  Buy people and companies borrowing money (one main point of QE - to try to keep interest rates low and give banks reserve assets to lend against to encourage borrowing).  


So does everyone want to go out and finance a car at 2% right now becasue next year the rate will be 4% or higher (i don't know what the current rates are, just as an example)?  I don't think so.  Are companies loading up more debt now becasue it will be more expensive next year?  Doesn't seem like it.  In fact the reverse is happening, credit is contracting, or at least not expanding at the rate it needs to.  


The only thing about inflation is that it is such a big deal, that it does present a serious concern.   


Burry is obviously long inflation.  But he is also short TSLA.  Now I've never bought into TSLA myself (clearly I was wrong), but I have watched people and funds try to short it since 2013 and it has never ended well.  It does look like it could drop here - but it has done this many, many times in the last 10 years.  One ballsy trade and some luck does not mean you are going to always be right.  Like we haven't seen funds blow up before.  


Just my 2c.  I'm not YOLOing a trade based on inflation/disinflation.",,

 While the mainstream media overlooks the NFIB data, they really shouldn‚Äôt. There are currently 30.7 million small businesses in the United States[*.*](https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/23142610/2019-Small-Business-Profiles-States-Territories.pdf) Small businesses *(defined as fewer than 500 employees)* **account for 99% of all enterprises, employ 60 million people, and account for nearly 70% of employment.** The chart below shows the breakdown of firms and jobs from the 2019 Census Bureau Data. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zw4426oprhz61.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=5692ffc300115b9a511e1647232fb8032c5f958b

 Let‚Äôs dig in. 

 

### NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w6h4saayrhz61.png?width=907&format=png&auto=webp&s=05dc1256be3e935048e02e19f4c57d0e09cb3e16

 Not surprisingly, given the economy is still struggling with the current recovery,   ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù                               remains extremely weak. 

 The importance of *‚Äúweak confidence‚Äù* also affects the *‚Äúrisk‚Äù* business owners will take concerning capital expenditures, employment, and sales. **Importantly,¬†this is a** ***‚Äúsentiment‚Äù*** **based survey.** Such is a crucial concept to understand as ***‚Äúplanning‚Äù*** **to do something and** ***‚Äúdoing‚Äù*** **it can be very different.** 

 

### An Economic Boom Will Require Participation

Currently, many analysts expect a massive economic boom in 2021. The basis of those expectations is massive *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* demand as the economy reopens.

**I would agree with that expectation had there been no stimulus programs or expanded unemployment benefits.** Those inflows allowed individuals to spend during a recession where such would not usually be the case. Those artificial inputs dragged forward future or *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* consumption into the present.

However, the NFIB survey also suggests much the same.

**Small businesses are susceptible to economic downturns and don‚Äôt have access to public markets for debt or secondary offerings. As such, they tend to focus heavily on operating efficiencies and profitability.**

**If businesses were expecting a massive surge in** ***‚Äúpent up‚Äù*** **demand, they would be doing several things to prepare for it.** Such includes planning to increase capital expenditures to meet expected demand. Unfortunately, those expectations peaked in 2018 and are dropping back to the March 2020 lows.

 

### Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *‚Äúactually‚Äù* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *‚Äúdemand‚Äù* meets its operating cash flows.

To increase employment, which is the single most considerable cost to any business, you need two things:

1. *Confidence the economy is going to continue to grow in the future, which leads to;*
2. *The increase in the production of goods or services requiring increased employment to meet growing demand.*

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qgpd1rqeshz61.png?width=804&format=png&auto=webp&s=cdf5af23ed3d590678c02894f1f43198031bf874

 Businesses understand that the stimulus [***‚Äúpulled forward‚Äù*** ](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***‚Äúcosts‚Äù*** **of** ***‚Äúlong-term employment‚Äù*** **for a** ***‚Äúshort-term‚Äù*** **artificial economic boost.** 

 

### The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.**¬†Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9vqsosfkshz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=d46a184ce87c222fc678ef69b207c8956ba94d17

 

While stimulus may lead to a short-term boost in consumption, the impact of higher taxes, more regulations, and weak employment growth will suppress consumption longer-term.

Despite economic headlines, the recovery of sales for small businesses has been less than *‚Äúbooming.‚Äù*

 

### A Recovery Versus An Expansion

With this background, it is easier to understand why the recent exuberance in chasing small-cap stocks may be premature. **While small-cap companies do historically perform well coming out of recession, the basis was an organic recovery cycle of increasing productivity.**

Currently, the run-up remains the assumption that the stimulus-fueled recovery is sustainable. **Such is only the case if the stimulus becomes a regular benefit and increases in size annually. However, since** [***deficit-based spending is deflationary***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/macroview-a-vaccine-and-the-new-new-normal/)***,***¬†the outcome will fall well short of expectations.

>*‚Äúin 1998, the Federal Reserve ‚Äúcrossed the ‚ÄòRubicon,‚Äô whereby lowering interest rates failed to stimulate economic growth or inflation as the ‚Äòdebt burden‚Äô detracted from it. When compared to the total debt of the economy, monetary velocity shows the problem facing the Fed.‚Äù*

https://preview.redd.it/2budem4qshz61.png?width=1025&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3597e6ad0a525708b14a84e4b20ec242d56f381

 **Such is a critical point as it relates to small-cap companies given their high correlation to small-business confidence.** The correlation between the small-cap index (Russell 2000) and underlying confidence is very high. Given the annual change in ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù is declining, it is not surprising to see that small-cap stocks recently peaked. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1fi4wzptshz61.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a30c19ab1f3f10f823bbcb3eab9b287201d622e

 

### Conclusion

Given that debt-driven government spending programs have a dismal history of providing the economic growth promised, disappointment over the next year is almost a guarantee.

While there are indeed *‚Äúinflationary pressures‚Äù* short-term as the massive infusions, coupled with supply shortages and delivery bottlenecks, higher prices will erode purchasing power. The decline in purchasing power, combined with higher input costs, and potentially higher taxes, will continue to weigh on confidence near term.

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive.

**Most importantly, there is a massive difference between** ***‚Äúgetting back to even‚Äù*** **versus** ***‚Äúgrowing the economy.‚Äù*** **One creates economic prosperity by expanding production, which creates consumption. The other does not.**

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/4d4qsqg1fiz61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=83455a752058a48e36142935298d3b0975e665eb

GME narrowly edged out PLTR to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. Both the stocks have very similar sentiment due to the wild rides the stock price had this week. AMC also had a significant jump in chatter due to the \~30% rally the stock experienced this week. Newcomers to the top 10 list are UWMC due to their strong Q2 outlook and buyback announcement as well as Alibaba group whose stock took a beating this week but investors are still bullish on the long-term aspects of the company which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/n3f1wc23fiz61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6f1f81111ce5e15f436bf6b3648a6c77e4da3ca)

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Inovio Pharmaceuticals($INO)** was creating chatter mainly due to two reasons. They filed a joint patent with Regeneron($REGN) for treating GBM (a type of severe brain cancer which did not have a cure till now). The trial results look promising and also there have been some unsubstantiated rumors about Regeneron buying out Inovio. Adding to this, they have also completed Phase II trial for their Covid-19 vaccine which showed an excellent immune response. The USP is that the vaccine does not require refrigeration and is cheap to manufacture which makes it ideal for developing countries. Overall investors seem to be extremely bullish on the stock which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Trade Desk($TTD)** stock declined more than 25% on a single day following the company‚Äôs latest earnings report. Even though the company‚Äôs revenue climbed 37% compared to the year-earlier quarter, have kept customer retention rates over 95%, and announced a 10-for-1 stock split, investors did not seem to appreciate the short-term future prospects of the company and were expecting an even bigger beat of estimates. The sell-off can also be partially attributed to ‚ÄúCookie Crisis‚Äù - the traditional way publishers and marketers have collected consumer data ‚Äì through third-party ‚Äúcookies‚Äù ‚Äì is being phased out of the industry due to data privacy and control concerns. This can be an existential crisis for Trade Desk‚Äôs business model. ¬†

**Fubotv ($FUBO)** stock has been highly volatile ever since its IPO in October. The stock spiked as high as $60 but since has fallen to nearly $20. Shares of the company jumped earlier this week due to strong quarterly reports with revenue rising more than 135% and subscriber base doubling from the year-ago quarter. The share price again popped on Friday with the stock finishing up 12.4%.¬†

**Alibaba Group ($BABA)** has been down \~20% last month. Their earnings report also did not help with the company missing the earnings but beat on revenue and annual active consumers. The company‚Äôs earnings were heavily affected by a $2.8 Billion fine imposed by China for Market Regulation. There are mixed opinions from the investing crowd with some believing that the stock is oversold and is undervalued right now vs others believing it‚Äôs not prudent to invest in Chinese stocks.¬†¬†

**UWM holdings ($UWMC)** has been trending due to their quarterly report and the CEO‚Äôs announcement to buy back $300MM of shares. Investors believe that the company‚Äôs share price is at all-time lows and the company having a low PE ratio and a 5.7% dividend yield makes it all the more attractive. The company is also being considered to be added to Russell 1000 in June which can be a short-term catalyst.¬†

SOME FAQ‚Äôs:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

3805,,2021-05-16 16:51:38,t3_ndsgrw,,wallstreetbets,"Sup ya'll. I was reading through Roblox investors relations and thought it was note-worthy that this company is not doing traditional quarterly reports and will instead run with monthly reports as a way to be transparent about company progress with respect to bookings, which is their main financial metric outside and of revenue/engagement/developer share.

I expect that this is going to produce some pretty intense price action. I follow this company closely as both an investor and Roblox developer and thought this strategy was quite interesting.

I personally hold a really bullish view on this company. I believe that engagement will go up a lot this summer rather than the somewhat expected decline across some media markets that mostly cater to young adults/working adults.

Kids main consumption/engagement in the market is staying in and playing video games since schooling responsibility is gone. Even when school returns, it's a place for kids to congregate and talk about this stuff. 

# Roblox is basically Instagram for kids and Dave Baszucki isn't a FREAK like ZUCKERBORG. Similar jealousy incentives behind Roblox too. Every kid wants to look unique and not like a default baconhead if you know what I mean.


> Well, envy/jealousy made, what, two out of the ten commandments? Those of you who have raised siblings you know about envy, or tried to run a law firm or investment bank or even a faculty? Ive heard Warren say a half a dozen times, 'Its not greed that drives the world, but envy."" - Charlie Munger 

I wrote super epic 10 page DD on Roblox on the long-term view on the  Developer Studio in case this subject is of interest to anyone. But I'm scared to post it because I might get slam dunked by the automod for the 20 billionth time.

And before you say ""oh ya it's so overvalued it's market cap is bigger than X, Y, and Z"" just take a damn moment to consider that the target market is obviously children, of which there are billions of them. These are customers whose core spend include:

1. Eating and staying alive
2. Clothes
3. Toys 
4. Education

Roblox belongs in categories 2, 3, and 4. Legos earns 5 billion in revenue while Blizzard earns 8 billion. Do the math, the company has potential.",ndsgrw,Roblox will be volatile in 2021 due to monthly reporting over quarterly reports.

ADDITIVE EVERYTHING

3D PRINTED AIRPLANE ENGINES this is some futuristic next tech tree shit you only see in Starcraft. Is Ge going to be the first to make a battle cruiser? I don't fucking know, are there going to be Zerg, possibly who the fuck knows in this simulation. You think they're going to just stop there and this brings me to my next point. Air travel is going to start to recover bigly soon.

Renewables

WIND TURBINES these things are so fucking optimized, have you seen the Haliade-x 14Mw of Power. Have you been looking at the news, look in Biden's eyes you can practically see the propeller turning, he just approved of the first farm. These bitches are going to be popping up everywhere offshore. There's already 17 wind farms being planned in the Atlantic ocean. 1,500 Wind turbines.

And THATS JUST THE ATLANTIC OCEAN, WHAT ABOUT THE fucking LIBTARD PACIFIC OCEAN? You don't think mother fucking California isn't going to want FUCKING WIND TURBINE ACTION? You might be like kek I thought they wanted to preserve their coast line or some shit. FUCK NO! They're flippy floppy as fuck and power hungry this is going to happen whether you believe it or not. You don't think GAY PEOPLE are going to want wind turbines? If there's one thing I know about gay people its they love things that twirl, believe me I loved watching these things in the pass twirl as a kid, and my mom would call me a faggot all the time. I REFUSE TO APOLOGIZE FOR THIS!

Guess what fucking state is BETTER THAN CALIFORNIA in wind? MOTHER FUCKING BIG ASS TEXAS, the biggest mother fucking state to ever fucking live, 20% of their energy comes from wind ALREADY, what the fuck are you libtards doing?! TEXAS ALREADY LEAVING YOU IN THE DUST. I broke rule 5, what are you going to do about it, not going to wear a mask in my OWN HOUSE EITHER! Now wind turbines froze up for a bit, but guess what, they can be weather proofed so that shit doesn't happen ever again. They have mother fucking weather proofed wind turbines in Antarctica for fuck sakes.

[https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/](https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/)

And this is just the fucking OCEAN TOO! Guess what wind turbines can be put on also instead of water that's fucking right land too and there's plenty of that all the states have it. ^(One thing to note though wind turbines are much more efficient offshore.) Have you looked at the new CS GO MAP DE\_GRIND? THERE'S ALREADY 22 WIND TURBINES ON IT ALREADY, and believe me THEY'RE GOING TO ADD MORE! I CALL VALVE EVERY SINGLE DAMN DAY REQUESTING MORE TURBINES. That has to be a sign right? RIGHT?

And this is only in the fucking US, THERE'S OTHER FUCKING PLACES ALSO GE just partnered with Toshiba. 10 GW OF power buy 2030 1Gw each year in japan! THAT'S A FUCKING TON OF WIND TURBINES, holy shit. Toshiba is going to put a windmill in every single fucking Japan.

You know WSB doesn't give a shit about GE, I get it that's fine they didn't give a shit about GME in the beginning either with strong hard DD from DFV. Is this going to moon? No, but its going to have a sweet sweet dividend soon and a nice gradual increase for the years with other boomers flocking to it, yes. I know your portfolio is maybe 3-5% GE but I am going to need you to drain everything you have and make it 100% maybe even 130% GE why?

And there's so so so much other fucking cool ass shit that GE does, these bitches can make a train did you fucking know that? How bout all the medical tech stuff? They just released a new portable baby scanner.

LOADS OF DEBT being paid off.

Harry Markopolos the guy that caught Bernie Madoff says there's a bunch of fraud. So you know you are really gambling when you buy this stock if he says so. Nobody is trying to squeeze this. If you're a Tesla fanboy this stock probably isn't for you. Tesla and Edison hated each other, does this matter? Probably not, but it makes you wonder.

$8 Billion FREE FLOAT, not all that good BUT I AM USING CAPS, SO GET EXCITED!

$13 something is current price per share ---> 13 is a LUCKY NUMBER.

BILL GATES SAYS %80 wind/solar by 2040 or some shit like that in his book, believe me I read it

Bill Gates also READ Jeff Immelt book believe me I read it on reddit that he read it! he said so himself.

Jeff Immelt also has a tattoo of a fucking meatball on his hip. (previous CEO) Does this matter? Fuck ya it does meatballs are fucking awesome.

If you guys TRULY love risky plays THIS IS FUCKING IT! I don't know if money is going to start coming out of tech and into value, but if it were going to happen, I'd put my money that its going to happen sooner than later.

Every mother fucking state is going to have windmills, 

Once this ball starts to REALLY ROLL its going to ROLL, ROLL straight up that fucking hill and it won't stop, until its down the next hill then ROLLING up the next one then itll roll straight up fucking up MT EVEREST!!!

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

&nbsp;

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, and checking out my socials, it would mean a lot to me! **Happy Trading Everybody! :)**",ne1fla,"Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation (Week 5) - $HD, $WMT, $TGT, $LOW, $CSCO, $GOEV, $XL, $SE and More"

Go to the IBEW Local 1245 in Vacaville, CA and sign book 4 as a groundman. If you don‚Äôt live in California, make the trip. Pay is $36.17 an hour and all overtime you work past 8 hours everyday is double time. A typical work week is 5/10‚Äôs with $50 (sometimes $100) per-diem every day ($2,410 a week). It‚Äôs fire season, so companies are hiring off the books quickly, we‚Äôll be starting 7/16‚Äôs soon (over $24,000 a month). It‚Äôs rough work, we dig holes 15ft deep by hand using a shovel and jack hammer, sometimes you get lucky and ground for a lineman crew, but that‚Äôs rare. So you‚Äôll be digging or standing around all day flagging traffic. It takes a while to be called from book 4, but that will give you time to work out those pharmacy twigs of arms you might have into some $36hr worth of digging man strength. You can claim your losses on your taxes and make bank being a grunt worker, just some career advise they don‚Äôt give you in high school",,

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/4d4qsqg1fiz61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=83455a752058a48e36142935298d3b0975e665eb

GME narrowly edged out PLTR to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. Both the stocks have very similar sentiment due to the wild rides the stock price had this week. AMC also had a significant jump in chatter due to the \~30% rally the stock experienced this week. Newcomers to the top 10 list are UWMC due to their strong Q2 outlook and buyback announcement as well as Alibaba group whose stock took a beating this week but investors are still bullish on the long-term aspects of the company which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/n3f1wc23fiz61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6f1f81111ce5e15f436bf6b3648a6c77e4da3ca)

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Inovio Pharmaceuticals($INO)** was creating chatter mainly due to two reasons. They filed a joint patent with Regeneron($REGN) for treating GBM (a type of severe brain cancer which did not have a cure till now). The trial results look promising and also there have been some unsubstantiated rumors about Regeneron buying out Inovio. Adding to this, they have also completed Phase II trial for their Covid-19 vaccine which showed an excellent immune response. The USP is that the vaccine does not require refrigeration and is cheap to manufacture which makes it ideal for developing countries. Overall investors seem to be extremely bullish on the stock which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Trade Desk($TTD)** stock declined more than 25% on a single day following the company‚Äôs latest earnings report. Even though the company‚Äôs revenue climbed 37% compared to the year-earlier quarter, have kept customer retention rates over 95%, and announced a 10-for-1 stock split, investors did not seem to appreciate the short-term future prospects of the company and were expecting an even bigger beat of estimates. The sell-off can also be partially attributed to ‚ÄúCookie Crisis‚Äù - the traditional way publishers and marketers have collected consumer data ‚Äì through third-party ‚Äúcookies‚Äù ‚Äì is being phased out of the industry due to data privacy and control concerns. This can be an existential crisis for Trade Desk‚Äôs business model. ¬†

**Fubotv ($FUBO)** stock has been highly volatile ever since its IPO in October. The stock spiked as high as $60 but since has fallen to nearly $20. Shares of the company jumped earlier this week due to strong quarterly reports with revenue rising more than 135% and subscriber base doubling from the year-ago quarter. The share price again popped on Friday with the stock finishing up 12.4%.¬†

**Alibaba Group ($BABA)** has been down \~20% last month. Their earnings report also did not help with the company missing the earnings but beat on revenue and annual active consumers. The company‚Äôs earnings were heavily affected by a $2.8 Billion fine imposed by China for Market Regulation. There are mixed opinions from the investing crowd with some believing that the stock is oversold and is undervalued right now vs others believing it‚Äôs not prudent to invest in Chinese stocks.¬†¬†

**UWM holdings ($UWMC)** has been trending due to their quarterly report and the CEO‚Äôs announcement to buy back $300MM of shares. Investors believe that the company‚Äôs share price is at all-time lows and the company having a low PE ratio and a 5.7% dividend yield makes it all the more attractive. The company is also being considered to be added to Russell 1000 in June which can be a short-term catalyst.¬†

SOME FAQ‚Äôs:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

4070,,2021-05-16 16:51:38,t3_ndsgrw,,wallstreetbets,"Sup ya'll. I was reading through Roblox investors relations and thought it was note-worthy that this company is not doing traditional quarterly reports and will instead run with monthly reports as a way to be transparent about company progress with respect to bookings, which is their main financial metric outside and of revenue/engagement/developer share.

I expect that this is going to produce some pretty intense price action. I follow this company closely as both an investor and Roblox developer and thought this strategy was quite interesting.

I personally hold a really bullish view on this company. I believe that engagement will go up a lot this summer rather than the somewhat expected decline across some media markets that mostly cater to young adults/working adults.

Kids main consumption/engagement in the market is staying in and playing video games since schooling responsibility is gone. Even when school returns, it's a place for kids to congregate and talk about this stuff. 

# Roblox is basically Instagram for kids and Dave Baszucki isn't a FREAK like ZUCKERBORG. Similar jealousy incentives behind Roblox too. Every kid wants to look unique and not like a default baconhead if you know what I mean.


> Well, envy/jealousy made, what, two out of the ten commandments? Those of you who have raised siblings you know about envy, or tried to run a law firm or investment bank or even a faculty? Ive heard Warren say a half a dozen times, 'Its not greed that drives the world, but envy."" - Charlie Munger 

I wrote super epic 10 page DD on Roblox on the long-term view on the  Developer Studio in case this subject is of interest to anyone. But I'm scared to post it because I might get slam dunked by the automod for the 20 billionth time.

And before you say ""oh ya it's so overvalued it's market cap is bigger than X, Y, and Z"" just take a damn moment to consider that the target market is obviously children, of which there are billions of them. These are customers whose core spend include:

1. Eating and staying alive
2. Clothes
3. Toys 
4. Education

Roblox belongs in categories 2, 3, and 4. Legos earns 5 billion in revenue while Blizzard earns 8 billion. Do the math, the company has potential.",ndsgrw,Roblox will be volatile in 2021 due to monthly reporting over quarterly reports.

ADDITIVE EVERYTHING

3D PRINTED AIRPLANE ENGINES this is some futuristic next tech tree shit you only see in Starcraft. Is Ge going to be the first to make a battle cruiser? I don't fucking know, are there going to be Zerg, possibly who the fuck knows in this simulation. You think they're going to just stop there and this brings me to my next point. Air travel is going to start to recover bigly soon.

Renewables

WIND TURBINES these things are so fucking optimized, have you seen the Haliade-x 14Mw of Power. Have you been looking at the news, look in Biden's eyes you can practically see the propeller turning, he just approved of the first farm. These bitches are going to be popping up everywhere offshore. There's already 17 wind farms being planned in the Atlantic ocean. 1,500 Wind turbines.

And THATS JUST THE ATLANTIC OCEAN, WHAT ABOUT THE fucking LIBTARD PACIFIC OCEAN? You don't think mother fucking California isn't going to want FUCKING WIND TURBINE ACTION? You might be like kek I thought they wanted to preserve their coast line or some shit. FUCK NO! They're flippy floppy as fuck and power hungry this is going to happen whether you believe it or not. You don't think GAY PEOPLE are going to want wind turbines? If there's one thing I know about gay people its they love things that twirl, believe me I loved watching these things in the pass twirl as a kid, and my mom would call me a faggot all the time. I REFUSE TO APOLOGIZE FOR THIS!

Guess what fucking state is BETTER THAN CALIFORNIA in wind? MOTHER FUCKING BIG ASS TEXAS, the biggest mother fucking state to ever fucking live, 20% of their energy comes from wind ALREADY, what the fuck are you libtards doing?! TEXAS ALREADY LEAVING YOU IN THE DUST. I broke rule 5, what are you going to do about it, not going to wear a mask in my OWN HOUSE EITHER! Now wind turbines froze up for a bit, but guess what, they can be weather proofed so that shit doesn't happen ever again. They have mother fucking weather proofed wind turbines in Antarctica for fuck sakes.

[https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/](https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/)

And this is just the fucking OCEAN TOO! Guess what wind turbines can be put on also instead of water that's fucking right land too and there's plenty of that all the states have it. ^(One thing to note though wind turbines are much more efficient offshore.) Have you looked at the new CS GO MAP DE\_GRIND? THERE'S ALREADY 22 WIND TURBINES ON IT ALREADY, and believe me THEY'RE GOING TO ADD MORE! I CALL VALVE EVERY SINGLE DAMN DAY REQUESTING MORE TURBINES. That has to be a sign right? RIGHT?

And this is only in the fucking US, THERE'S OTHER FUCKING PLACES ALSO GE just partnered with Toshiba. 10 GW OF power buy 2030 1Gw each year in japan! THAT'S A FUCKING TON OF WIND TURBINES, holy shit. Toshiba is going to put a windmill in every single fucking Japan.

>!Look Jim this part is for you, for your eyes only nobody else read I swear to fuck. I am going to need you to go and drain your bank account and put every single last red cent into GE, I feel it, you feel it. You know WSB doesn't give a shit about GE, I get it that's fine they didn't give a shit about GME in the beginning either with strong hard DD from DFV. Is this going to moon? No, but its going to have a sweet sweet dividend soon and a nice gradual increase for the years with other boomers flocking to it, yes. I know your portfolio is maybe 3-5% GE but I am going to need you to drain everything you have and make it 100% maybe even 130% GE why? I don't know I have a raging hard clue about this, I talked to you in my dreams. Did you have the same dream too? Ya, that's what I thought, we can both smell it blowing in the wind.!<

Then there's SOLAR POWER, look at the 3rd fastest growing job market. GE is in this as well!

And there's so so so much other fucking cool ass shit that GE does, these bitches can make a train did you fucking know that? How bout all the medical tech stuff? They just released a new portable baby scanner.

LOADS OF DEBT being paid off.

Harry Markopolos the guy that caught Bernie Madoff says there's a bunch of fraud. So you know you are really gambling when you buy this stock if he says so. Nobody is trying to squeeze this. If you're a Tesla fanboy this stock probably isn't for you. Tesla and Edison hated each other, does this matter? Probably not, but it makes you wonder.

$8 Billion FREE FLOAT, not all that good BUT I AM USING CAPS, SO GET EXCITED!

$13 something is current price per share ---> 13 is a LUCKY NUMBER.

BILL GATES SAYS %80 wind/solar by 2040 or some shit like that in his book, believe me I read it

Bill Gates also READ Jeff Immelt book believe me I read it on reddit that he read it! he said so himself.

Jeff Immelt also has a tattoo of a fucking meatball on his hip. (previous CEO) Does this matter? Fuck ya it does meatballs are fucking awesome.

If you guys TRULY love risky plays THIS IS FUCKING IT! I don't know if money is going to start coming out of tech and into value, but if it were going to happen, I'd put my money that its going to happen sooner than later.

Every mother fucking state is going to have windmills, 

Once this ball starts to REALLY ROLL its going to ROLL, ROLL straight up that fucking hill and it won't stop, until its down the next hill then ROLLING up the next one then itll roll straight up fucking up MT EVEREST!!!

I AM WAVING THE FUCKING AMERICAN GOD DAMN FLAG RIGHT NOW ALERTING all of you like PAUL f'ing REVERE.

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

&nbsp;

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, and checking out my socials, it would mean a lot to me! **Happy Trading Everybody! :)**",ne1fla,"Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation (Week 5) - $HD, $WMT, $TGT, $LOW, $CSCO, $GOEV, $XL, $SE and More"

[**Anders Bylund**](https://boards.fool.com/profile/TMFZahrim/info.aspx) **(Nokia):** Few tech stocks have weathered the recent market storm quite like Finnish telecom infrastructure veteran Nokia. The stock has gained 32% since the New Year, including a 14% jump over the last 30 days. By contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is trading flat in 2021 and fell 7% in the last month.

This stock may feel like a joke due to the recent influx of Nokia interest from the Reddit-based WallStreetBets group, but that's just a coincidence. Nokia's real-world business prospects are solid and the stock is actually undervalued, even though it dodged the tech-stock market correction in recent months.

Nokia's solid market position was built on a foundation of [5G network](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) installations. Top-line sales are rising faster than expected, Nokia's profit margin is expanding as we speak thanks to the richer product mix, and the stock is changing hands for less than eight times free cash flow. You don't see that combination of deep-discount stock prices and robust business trends very often, and that makes Nokia a no-brainer buy right now.",ne3k42,Nokia an industry leader in the bargain bin

Home Depot reports earnings premarket 5/18. HD has beat earnings consistently and the share price has reacted negatively each time. In this market I feel like the play here is a strangle. My proposed play is the closest to the money strikes. Right now based on $324 list that would be the 5/21 323.5P/325C. You are in for about $1k. Break even is 3% in either direction. Of course we are hoping for 6% at least.

November earnings was a beat and the stock dropped 6% that day. That would be 100% profit with the trade I propose for educational purposes only. The previous report had a -3.2% drop that day which would still print.

Here is the kicker. The 5 day high is $344 (5/10) and low $317 (5/12) for a 2 day swing of 8.4% bases on Friday close. This is key because it means there is the potential for both sides of the strangle to be profitable prior to expiration! Nuts right?

Here is how to play it. Watch the housing report tomorrow (5/17). With lumber prices being insane new construction might be a miss. If HD stock goes down you will need to consider if the market will price this in when digesting an earnings miss. You will want to wait until the end of the day to enter the strangle to make sure you have strikes that put the Monday close in the middle.

If earnings are a beat and the prices goes up >3% sell the call once you are happy with the profit. Lock in your tuition money because again, this is for education. Same goes for the inverse. Then you have until Friday to try to get tendies with the other side. Can't remember the Vince Vaughn line from Dodge ball but it think it's ""that's what we call the jackpot"".

Not WSB material you say? Earnings plays are inherently gambling and sir, this is a casino.

Positions: none yet. Ask me at 3PM tomorrow you illiterate ape.

TLDR: Home Depot is usually located in  very close proximity to a Wendy's = tendies.

Friday, I decided to load up on 1-2 week out OTM calls (at strikes probably around 10%-30% above the current market value). I‚Äôll be throwing a couple grand a week at this trade til it hits! 

MGM, NCLH, BA, BP are my picks. Each from a different industry, positively impacted by the reopening and ensuing pent-up demand of the economy. I‚Äôm swinging for the MIL on this! 

I‚Äôm a bull here for technical reasons. However, the fundamentals make sense here now as well. The current bull-market trendlines on all the reopen stonks started with a vaccine announcement on November 9th in the early A.M. (the freaking insiders bought/drove up prices before the market opened, that sucked).

The CDC letting ‚Äúvaccinated‚Äù people stop social distancing has majorly positive implications for the economy. Think of traveling, think of the impeding Memorial Day weekend...

Go check out the 1-year, 1-day charts for these stocks, and draw a line from the close on November 6th to now. I think we see 30% or more gains in the value of these stocks the next couple weeks.

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/4d4qsqg1fiz61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=83455a752058a48e36142935298d3b0975e665eb

GME narrowly edged out PLTR to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. Both the stocks have very similar sentiment due to the wild rides the stock price had this week. AMC also had a significant jump in chatter due to the \~30% rally the stock experienced this week. Newcomers to the top 10 list are UWMC due to their strong Q2 outlook and buyback announcement as well as Alibaba group whose stock took a beating this week but investors are still bullish on the long-term aspects of the company which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/n3f1wc23fiz61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6f1f81111ce5e15f436bf6b3648a6c77e4da3ca)

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Inovio Pharmaceuticals($INO)** was creating chatter mainly due to two reasons. They filed a joint patent with Regeneron($REGN) for treating GBM (a type of severe brain cancer which did not have a cure till now). The trial results look promising and also there have been some unsubstantiated rumors about Regeneron buying out Inovio. Adding to this, they have also completed Phase II trial for their Covid-19 vaccine which showed an excellent immune response. The USP is that the vaccine does not require refrigeration and is cheap to manufacture which makes it ideal for developing countries. Overall investors seem to be extremely bullish on the stock which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Trade Desk($TTD)** stock declined more than 25% on a single day following the company‚Äôs latest earnings report. Even though the company‚Äôs revenue climbed 37% compared to the year-earlier quarter, have kept customer retention rates over 95%, and announced a 10-for-1 stock split, investors did not seem to appreciate the short-term future prospects of the company and were expecting an even bigger beat of estimates. The sell-off can also be partially attributed to ‚ÄúCookie Crisis‚Äù - the traditional way publishers and marketers have collected consumer data ‚Äì through third-party ‚Äúcookies‚Äù ‚Äì is being phased out of the industry due to data privacy and control concerns. This can be an existential crisis for Trade Desk‚Äôs business model. ¬†

**Fubotv ($FUBO)** stock has been highly volatile ever since its IPO in October. The stock spiked as high as $60 but since has fallen to nearly $20. Shares of the company jumped earlier this week due to strong quarterly reports with revenue rising more than 135% and subscriber base doubling from the year-ago quarter. The share price again popped on Friday with the stock finishing up 12.4%.¬†

**Alibaba Group ($BABA)** has been down \~20% last month. Their earnings report also did not help with the company missing the earnings but beat on revenue and annual active consumers. The company‚Äôs earnings were heavily affected by a $2.8 Billion fine imposed by China for Market Regulation. There are mixed opinions from the investing crowd with some believing that the stock is oversold and is undervalued right now vs others believing it‚Äôs not prudent to invest in Chinese stocks.¬†¬†

**UWM holdings ($UWMC)** has been trending due to their quarterly report and the CEO‚Äôs announcement to buy back $300MM of shares. Investors believe that the company‚Äôs share price is at all-time lows and the company having a low PE ratio and a 5.7% dividend yield makes it all the more attractive. The company is also being considered to be added to Russell 1000 in June which can be a short-term catalyst.¬†

SOME FAQ‚Äôs:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

4276,,2021-05-16 16:51:38,t3_ndsgrw,,wallstreetbets,"Sup ya'll. I was reading through Roblox investors relations and thought it was note-worthy that this company is not doing traditional quarterly reports and will instead run with monthly reports as a way to be transparent about company progress with respect to bookings, which is their main financial metric outside and of revenue/engagement/developer share.

I expect that this is going to produce some pretty intense price action. I follow this company closely as both an investor and Roblox developer and thought this strategy was quite interesting.

I personally hold a really bullish view on this company. I believe that engagement will go up a lot this summer rather than the somewhat expected decline across some media markets that mostly cater to young adults/working adults.

Kids main consumption/engagement in the market is staying in and playing video games since schooling responsibility is gone. Even when school returns, it's a place for kids to congregate and talk about this stuff. 

# Roblox is basically Instagram for kids and Dave Baszucki isn't a FREAK like ZUCKERBORG. Similar jealousy incentives behind Roblox too. Every kid wants to look unique and not like a default baconhead if you know what I mean.


> Well, envy/jealousy made, what, two out of the ten commandments? Those of you who have raised siblings you know about envy, or tried to run a law firm or investment bank or even a faculty? Ive heard Warren say a half a dozen times, 'Its not greed that drives the world, but envy."" - Charlie Munger 

I wrote super epic 10 page DD on Roblox on the long-term view on the  Developer Studio in case this subject is of interest to anyone. But I'm scared to post it because I might get slam dunked by the automod for the 20 billionth time.

And before you say ""oh ya it's so overvalued it's market cap is bigger than X, Y, and Z"" just take a damn moment to consider that the target market is obviously children, of which there are billions of them. These are customers whose core spend include:

1. Eating and staying alive
2. Clothes
3. Toys 
4. Education

Roblox belongs in categories 2, 3, and 4. Legos earns 5 billion in revenue while Blizzard earns 8 billion. Do the math, the company has potential.",ndsgrw,Roblox will be volatile in 2021 due to monthly reporting over quarterly reports.

You might be like kek I thought they wanted to preserve their coast line or some shit. FUCK NO! They're flippy floppy as fuck and power hungry this is going to happen whether you believe it or not. You don't think GAY PEOPLE are going to want wind turbines? If there's one thing I know about gay people its they love things that twirl, believe me I loved watching these things in the pass twirl as a kid, and my mom would call me a faggot all the time. I REFUSE TO APOLOGIZE FOR THIS!

Guess what fucking state is BETTER THAN CALIFORNIA in wind? MOTHER FUCKING BIG ASS TEXAS, the biggest mother fucking state to ever fucking live, 20% of their energy comes from wind ALREADY, what the fuck are you libtards doing?! TEXAS ALREADY LEAVING YOU IN THE DUST. I broke rule 5, what are you going to do about it, not going to wear a mask in my OWN HOUSE EITHER! Now wind turbines froze up for a bit, but guess what, they can be weather proofed so that shit doesn't happen ever again. They have mother fucking weather proofed wind turbines in Antarctica for fuck sakes.

[https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/](https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/)

And this is just the fucking OCEAN TOO! Guess what wind turbines can be put on also instead of water that's fucking right land too and there's plenty of that all the states have it. ^(One thing to note though wind turbines are much more efficient offshore.) Have you looked at the new CS GO MAP DE\_GRIND? THERE'S ALREADY 22 WIND TURBINES ON IT ALREADY, and believe me THEY'RE GOING TO ADD MORE! I CALL VALVE EVERY SINGLE DAMN DAY REQUESTING MORE TURBINES. That has to be a sign right? RIGHT?

And this is only in the fucking US, THERE'S OTHER FUCKING PLACES ALSO GE just partnered with Toshiba. 10 GW OF power buy 2030 1Gw each year in japan! THAT'S A FUCKING TON OF WIND TURBINES, holy shit. Toshiba is going to put a windmill in every single fucking Japan.

LOOK AT THE FUCKING Gosh dang fastest growing job market right now over the next 10 years. Does that account for anything? Am I the only one that can see the writing on the wall? Am I 6th Sense retarded?!?!

\*\*\*\*\*DON'T READ THIS PART UNLESS YOU'RE JIM CRAMER\*\*\*\*\*

>!Look Jim this part is for you, for your eyes only nobody else read I swear to fuck. I am going to need you to go and drain your bank account and put every single last red cent into GE, I feel it, you feel it. You know WSB doesn't give a shit about GE, I get it that's fine they didn't give a shit about GME in the beginning either with strong hard DD from DFV. Is this going to moon? No, but its going to have a sweet sweet dividend soon and a nice gradual increase for the years with other boomers flocking to it, yes. I know your portfolio is maybe 3-5% GE but I am going to need you to drain everything you have and make it 100% maybe even 130% GE why? I don't know I have a raging hard clue about this, I talked to you in my dreams. Did you have the same dream too? Ya, that's what I thought, we can both smell it blowing in the wind.!<

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Then there's SOLAR POWER, look at the 3rd fastest growing job market. GE is in this as well!

And there's so so so much other fucking cool ass shit that GE does, these bitches can make a train did you fucking know that? How bout all the medical tech stuff? They just released a new portable baby scanner.

LOADS OF DEBT being paid off.

Harry Markopolos the guy that caught Bernie Madoff says there's a bunch of fraud. So you know you are really gambling when you buy this stock if he says so. Nobody is trying to squeeze this. If you're a Tesla fanboy this stock probably isn't for you. Tesla and Edison hated each other, does this matter? Probably not, but it makes you wonder.

$8 Billion FREE FLOAT, not all that good BUT I AM USING CAPS, SO GET EXCITED!

$13 something is current price per share ---> 13 is a LUCKY NUMBER.

BILL GATES SAYS %80 wind/solar by 2040 or some shit like that in his book, believe me I read it

Bill Gates also READ Jeff Immelt book believe me I read it on reddit that he read it! he said so himself.

Jeff Immelt also has a tattoo of a fucking meatball on his hip. (previous CEO) Does this matter? Fuck ya it does meatballs are fucking awesome.

If you guys TRULY love risky plays THIS IS FUCKING IT! I don't know if money is going to start coming out of tech and into value, but if it were going to happen, I'd put my money that its going to happen sooner than later.

Every mother fucking state is going to have windmills, 

Once this ball starts to REALLY ROLL its going to ROLL, ROLL straight up that fucking hill and it won't stop, until its down the next hill then ROLLING up the next one then itll roll straight up fucking up MT EVEREST!!!

I AM WAVING THE FUCKING AMERICAN GOD DAMN FLAG RIGHT NOW ALERTING all of you like PAUL f'ing REVERE. 

If you hate the thought of America creating more job then don't buy. 

If you don't buy GE then you must hate America.  Why do you hate America so much?",ndxk81,"Serious discussion, no seriously please about GE. I know you hate it. Real Financial advice at the tippy top."

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

&nbsp;

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

&nbsp;

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, and checking out my socials, it would mean a lot to me! **Happy Trading Everybody! :)**",ne1fla,"Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation (Week 5) - $HD, $WMT, $TGT, $LOW, $CSCO, $GOEV, $XL, $SE and More"

HELLthcare is a forever industry.

But that‚Äôs an altogether different realm. 

Anyway. Companies don‚Äôt care if you failed out so much, you have already been exposed to medical terminology and that‚Äôs a big plus.

ADDITIVE EVERYTHING

3D PRINTED AIRPLANE ENGINES this is some futuristic next tech tree shit you only see in Starcraft. Is Ge going to be the first to make a battle cruiser? I don't fucking know, are there going to be Zerg, possibly who the fuck knows in this simulation. You think they're going to just stop there and this brings me to my next point. Air travel is going to start to recover bigly soon.

Renewables

WIND TURBINES these things are so fucking optimized, have you seen the Haliade-x 14Mw of Power. Have you been looking at the news, look in Biden's eyes you can practically see the propeller turning, he just approved of the first farm. These bitches are going to be popping up everywhere offshore. There's already 17 wind farms being planned in the Atlantic ocean. 1,500 Wind turbines.

And THATS JUST THE ATLANTIC OCEAN, WHAT ABOUT THE fucking LIBTARD PACIFIC OCEAN? You don't think mother fucking California isn't going to want FUCKING WIND TURBINE ACTION? You might be like kek I thought they wanted to preserve their coast line or some shit. FUCK NO! They're flippy floppy as fuck and power hungry this is going to happen whether you believe it or not. You don't think GAY PEOPLE are going to want wind turbines? If there's one thing I know about gay people its they love things that twirl, believe me I loved watching these things in the pass twirl as a kid, and my mom would call me a faggot all the time. I REFUSE TO APOLOGIZE FOR THIS!

Guess what fucking state is BETTER THAN CALIFORNIA in wind? MOTHER FUCKING BIG ASS TEXAS, the biggest mother fucking state to ever fucking live, 20% of their energy comes from wind ALREADY, what the fuck are you libtards doing?! TEXAS ALREADY LEAVING YOU IN THE DUST. I broke rule 5, what are you going to do about it, not going to wear a mask in my OWN HOUSE EITHER! Now wind turbines froze up for a bit, but guess what, they can be weather proofed so that shit doesn't happen ever again. They have mother fucking weather proofed wind turbines in Antarctica for fuck sakes.

And this is just the fucking OCEAN TOO! Guess what wind turbines can be put on also instead of water that's fucking right land too and there's plenty of that all the states have it. ^(One thing to note though wind turbines are much more efficient offshore.) Have you looked at the new CS GO MAP DE\_GRIND? THERE'S ALREADY 22 WIND TURBINES ON IT ALREADY, and believe me THEY'RE GOING TO ADD MORE! I CALL VALVE EVERY SINGLE DAMN DAY REQUESTING MORE TURBINES. That has to be a sign right? RIGHT?

And this is only in the fucking US, THERE'S OTHER FUCKING PLACES ALSO GE just partnered with Toshiba. 10 GW OF power buy 2030 1Gw each year in japan! THAT'S A FUCKING TON OF WIND TURBINES, holy shit. Toshiba is going to put a windmill in every single fucking Japan.

No, but its going to have a sweet sweet dividend soon and a nice gradual increase for the years with other boomers flocking to it, yes. I know your portfolio is maybe 3-5% GE but I am going to need you to drain everything you have and make it 100% maybe even 130% GE why?

LOADS OF DEBT being paid off.

Harry Markopolos the guy that caught Bernie Madoff says there's a bunch of fraud. So you know you are really gambling when you buy this stock if he says so. Nobody is trying to squeeze this. If you're a Tesla fanboy this stock probably isn't for you. Tesla and Edison hated each other, does this matter? Probably not, but it makes you wonder.

$8 Billion FREE FLOAT, not all that good BUT I AM USING CAPS, SO GET EXCITED!

BILL GATES SAYS %80 wind/solar by 2040 or some shit like that in his book, believe me I read it

Bill Gates also READ Jeff Immelt book believe me I read it on reddit that he read it! he said so himself.

Jeff Immelt also has a tattoo of a fucking meatball on his hip. (previous CEO) Does this matter? Fuck ya it does meatballs are fucking awesome.

If you guys TRULY love risky plays THIS IS FUCKING IT! I don't know if money is going to start coming out of tech and into value, but if it were going to happen, I'd put my money that its going to happen sooner than later.

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

&nbsp;

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

&nbsp;

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, and checking out my socials, it would mean a lot to me! **Happy Trading Everybody! :)**",ne1fla,"Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation (Week 5) - $HD, $WMT, $TGT, $LOW, $CSCO, $GOEV, $XL, $SE and More"

[**Anders Bylund**](https://boards.fool.com/profile/TMFZahrim/info.aspx) **(Nokia):** Few tech stocks have weathered the recent market storm quite like Finnish telecom infrastructure veteran Nokia. The stock has gained 32% since the New Year, including a 14% jump over the last 30 days. By contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is trading flat in 2021 and fell 7% in the last month.

This stock may feel like a joke due to the recent influx of Nokia interest from the Reddit-based WallStreetBets group, but that's just a coincidence. Nokia's real-world business prospects are solid and the stock is actually undervalued, even though it dodged the tech-stock market correction in recent months.

Nokia's solid market position was built on a foundation of [5G network](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) installations. Top-line sales are rising faster than expected, Nokia's profit margin is expanding as we speak thanks to the richer product mix, and the stock is changing hands for less than eight times free cash flow. You don't see that combination of deep-discount stock prices and robust business trends very often, and that makes Nokia a no-brainer buy right now.",ne3k42,Nokia an industry leader in the bargain bin

Home Depot reports earnings premarket 5/18. HD has beat earnings consistently and the share price has reacted negatively each time. In this market I feel like the play here is a strangle. My proposed play is the closest to the money strikes. Right now based on $324 list that would be the 5/21 323.5P/325C. You are in for about $1k. Break even is 3% in either direction. Of course we are hoping for 6% at least.

November earnings was a beat and the stock dropped 6% that day. That would be 100% profit with the trade I propose for educational purposes only. The previous report had a -3.2% drop that day which would still print.

Here is the kicker. The 5 day high is $344 (5/10) and low $317 (5/12) for a 2 day swing of 8.4% bases on Friday close. This is key because it means there is the potential for both sides of the strangle to be profitable prior to expiration! Nuts right?

Here is how to play it. Watch the housing report tomorrow (5/17). With lumber prices being insane new construction might be a miss. If HD stock goes down you will need to consider if the market will price this in when digesting an earnings miss. You will want to wait until the end of the day to enter the strangle to make sure you have strikes that put the Monday close in the middle.

If earnings are a beat and the prices goes up >3% sell the call once you are happy with the profit. Lock in your tuition money because again, this is for education. Same goes for the inverse. Then you have until Friday to try to get tendies with the other side. Can't remember the Vince Vaughn line from Dodge ball but it think it's ""that's what we call the jackpot"".

Not WSB material you say? Earnings plays are inherently gambling and sir, this is a casino.

Positions: none yet. Ask me at 3PM tomorrow you illiterate ape.

TLDR: Home Depot is usually located in  very close proximity to a Wendy's = tendies.

I‚Äôm a bull here for technical reasons. However, the fundamentals make sense here now as well.

The CDC letting ‚Äúvaccinated‚Äù people stop social distancing has majorly positive implications for the economy. Think of traveling, think of the impeding Memorial Day weekend...

Go check out the 1-year, 1-day charts for these stocks, and draw a line from the close on November 6th to now. I think we see 30% or more gains in the value of these stocks the next couple weeks.

ADDITIVE EVERYTHING

3D PRINTED AIRPLANE ENGINES this is some futuristic next tech tree shit you only see in Starcraft. Is Ge going to be the first to make a battle cruiser? I don't fucking know, are there going to be Zerg, possibly who the fuck knows in this simulation. You think they're going to just stop there and this brings me to my next point. Air travel is going to start to recover bigly soon.

Renewables

WIND TURBINES these things are so fucking optimized, have you seen the Haliade-x 14Mw of Power. Have you been looking at the news, look in Biden's eyes you can practically see the propeller turning, he just approved of the first farm. These bitches are going to be popping up everywhere offshore. There's already 17 wind farms being planned in the Atlantic ocean. 1,500 Wind turbines.

And THATS JUST THE ATLANTIC OCEAN, WHAT ABOUT THE fucking LIBTARD PACIFIC OCEAN? You don't think mother fucking California isn't going to want FUCKING WIND TURBINE ACTION? You might be like kek I thought they wanted to preserve their coast line or some shit. FUCK NO! They're flippy floppy as fuck and power hungry this is going to happen whether you believe it or not. You don't think GAY PEOPLE are going to want wind turbines? If there's one thing I know about gay people its they love things that twirl, believe me I loved watching these things in the pass twirl as a kid, and my mom would call me a faggot all the time. I REFUSE TO APOLOGIZE FOR THIS!

Guess what fucking state is BETTER THAN CALIFORNIA in wind? MOTHER FUCKING BIG ASS TEXAS, the biggest mother fucking state to ever fucking live, 20% of their energy comes from wind ALREADY, what the fuck are you libtards doing?! TEXAS ALREADY LEAVING YOU IN THE DUST. I broke rule 5, what are you going to do about it, not going to wear a mask in my OWN HOUSE EITHER! Now wind turbines froze up for a bit, but guess what, they can be weather proofed so that shit doesn't happen ever again. They have mother fucking weather proofed wind turbines in Antarctica for fuck sakes.

[https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/](https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/)

And this is just the fucking OCEAN TOO! Guess what wind turbines can be put on also instead of water that's fucking right land too and there's plenty of that all the states have it. ^(One thing to note though wind turbines are much more efficient offshore.) Have you looked at the new CS GO MAP DE\_GRIND? THERE'S ALREADY 22 WIND TURBINES ON IT ALREADY, and believe me THEY'RE GOING TO ADD MORE! I CALL VALVE EVERY SINGLE DAMN DAY REQUESTING MORE TURBINES. That has to be a sign right? RIGHT?

And this is only in the fucking US, THERE'S OTHER FUCKING PLACES ALSO GE just partnered with Toshiba. 10 GW OF power buy 2030 1Gw each year in japan! THAT'S A FUCKING TON OF WIND TURBINES, holy shit. Toshiba is going to put a windmill in every single fucking Japan.

You know WSB doesn't give a shit about GE, I get it that's fine they didn't give a shit about GME in the beginning either with strong hard DD from DFV. Is this going to moon? No, but its going to have a sweet sweet dividend soon and a nice gradual increase for the years with other boomers flocking to it, yes. I know your portfolio is maybe 3-5% GE but I am going to need you to drain everything you have and make it 100% maybe even 130% GE why? I don't know I have a raging hard clue about this, I talked to you in my dreams. Did you have the same dream too? Ya, that's what I thought, we can both smell it blowing in the wind.!<

And there's so so so much other fucking cool ass shit that GE does, these bitches can make a train did you fucking know that? How bout all the medical tech stuff? They just released a new portable baby scanner.

LOADS OF DEBT being paid off.

Harry Markopolos the guy that caught Bernie Madoff says there's a bunch of fraud. So you know you are really gambling when you buy this stock if he says so. Nobody is trying to squeeze this.

Bill Gates also READ Jeff Immelt book believe me I read it on reddit that he read it! he said so himself.

Jeff Immelt also has a tattoo of a fucking meatball on his hip. (previous CEO) Does this matter? Fuck ya it does meatballs are fucking awesome.

If you guys TRULY love risky plays THIS IS FUCKING IT! I don't know if money is going to start coming out of tech and into value, but if it were going to happen, I'd put my money that its going to happen sooner than later.

Every mother fucking state is going to have windmills,

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

&nbsp;

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

ADDITIVE EVERYTHING

3D PRINTED AIRPLANE ENGINES this is some futuristic next tech tree shit you only see in Starcraft. Is Ge going to be the first to make a battle cruiser? I don't fucking know, are there going to be Zerg, possibly who the fuck knows in this simulation. You think they're going to just stop there and this brings me to my next point. Air travel is going to start to recover bigly soon.

Renewables

WIND TURBINES these things are so fucking optimized, have you seen the Haliade-x 14Mw of Power. Have you been looking at the news, look in Biden's eyes you can practically see the propeller turning, he just approved of the first farm. These bitches are going to be popping up everywhere offshore. There's already 17 wind farms being planned in the Atlantic ocean. 1,500 Wind turbines.

And THATS JUST THE ATLANTIC OCEAN, WHAT ABOUT THE fucking LIBTARD PACIFIC OCEAN? You don't think mother fucking California isn't going to want FUCKING WIND TURBINE ACTION? You might be like kek I thought they wanted to preserve their coast line or some shit. FUCK NO! They're flippy floppy as fuck and power hungry this is going to happen whether you believe it or not. You don't think GAY PEOPLE are going to want wind turbines? If there's one thing I know about gay people its they love things that twirl, believe me I loved watching these things in the pass twirl as a kid, and my mom would call me a faggot all the time. I REFUSE TO APOLOGIZE FOR THIS!

Guess what fucking state is BETTER THAN CALIFORNIA in wind? MOTHER FUCKING BIG ASS TEXAS, the biggest mother fucking state to ever fucking live, 20% of their energy comes from wind ALREADY, what the fuck are you libtards doing?! TEXAS ALREADY LEAVING YOU IN THE DUST. I broke rule 5, what are you going to do about it, not going to wear a mask in my OWN HOUSE EITHER! Now wind turbines froze up for a bit, but guess what, they can be weather proofed so that shit doesn't happen ever again. They have mother fucking weather proofed wind turbines in Antarctica for fuck sakes.

[https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/](https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/)

And this is just the fucking OCEAN TOO! Guess what wind turbines can be put on also instead of water that's fucking right land too and there's plenty of that all the states have it. ^(One thing to note though wind turbines are much more efficient offshore.) Have you looked at the new CS GO MAP DE\_GRIND? THERE'S ALREADY 22 WIND TURBINES ON IT ALREADY, and believe me THEY'RE GOING TO ADD MORE! I CALL VALVE EVERY SINGLE DAMN DAY REQUESTING MORE TURBINES. That has to be a sign right? RIGHT?

And this is only in the fucking US, THERE'S OTHER FUCKING PLACES ALSO GE just partnered with Toshiba. 10 GW OF power buy 2030 1Gw each year in japan! THAT'S A FUCKING TON OF WIND TURBINES, holy shit. Toshiba is going to put a windmill in every single fucking Japan.

I am going to need you to go and drain your bank account and put every single last red cent into GE, I feel it, you feel it. You know WSB doesn't give a shit about GE, I get it that's fine they didn't give a shit about GME in the beginning either with strong hard DD from DFV. Is this going to moon? No, but its going to have a sweet sweet dividend soon and a nice gradual increase for the years with other boomers flocking to it, yes. I know your portfolio is maybe 3-5% GE but I am going to need you to drain everything you have and make it 100% maybe even 130% GE why? I don't know I have a raging hard clue about this, I talked to you in my dreams. Did you have the same dream too? Ya, that's what I thought, we can both smell it blowing in the wind.!<

Then there's SOLAR POWER, look at the 3rd fastest growing job market. GE is in this as well!

And there's so so so much other fucking cool ass shit that GE does, these bitches can make a train did you fucking know that? How bout all the medical tech stuff? They just released a new portable baby scanner.

LOADS OF DEBT being paid off.

Harry Markopolos the guy that caught Bernie Madoff says there's a bunch of fraud. So you know you are really gambling when you buy this stock if he says so. Nobody is trying to squeeze this. If you're a Tesla fanboy this stock probably isn't for you. Tesla and Edison hated each other, does this matter? Probably not, but it makes you wonder.

$8 Billion FREE FLOAT, not all that good BUT I AM USING CAPS, SO GET EXCITED!

$13 something is current price per share ---> 13 is a LUCKY NUMBER.

BILL GATES SAYS %80 wind/solar by 2040 or some shit like that in his book, believe me I read it

Bill Gates also READ Jeff Immelt book believe me I read it on reddit that he read it! he said so himself.

Jeff Immelt also has a tattoo of a fucking meatball on his hip. (previous CEO) Does this matter? Fuck ya it does meatballs are fucking awesome.

If you guys TRULY love risky plays THIS IS FUCKING IT! I don't know if money is going to start coming out of tech and into value, but if it were going to happen, I'd put my money that its going to happen sooner than later.

Every mother fucking state is going to have windmills, 

Once this ball starts to REALLY ROLL its going to ROLL, ROLL straight up that fucking hill and it won't stop, until its down the next hill then ROLLING up the next one then itll roll straight up fucking up MT EVEREST!!!

I AM WAVING THE FUCKING AMERICAN GOD DAMN FLAG RIGHT NOW ALERTING all of you like PAUL f'ing REVERE.

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

&nbsp;

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

&nbsp;

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly!

I guess my question is, why do you think investment in renewable energy will produce superior returns than investing in another sector of the economy like tech, consumer staples, or healthcare?

Energy producers, energy distributors, and utilities are all capital intensive, highly regulated, and have historically had middle of the road returns.

ADDITIVE EVERYTHING

3D PRINTED AIRPLANE ENGINES this is some futuristic next tech tree shit you only see in Starcraft. Is Ge going to be the first to make a battle cruiser? I don't fucking know, are there going to be Zerg, possibly who the fuck knows in this simulation. You think they're going to just stop there and this brings me to my next point. Air travel is going to start to recover bigly soon.

Renewables

WIND TURBINES these things are so fucking optimized, have you seen the Haliade-x 14Mw of Power. Have you been looking at the news, look in Biden's eyes you can practically see the propeller turning, he just approved of the first farm. These bitches are going to be popping up everywhere offshore. There's already 17 wind farms being planned in the Atlantic ocean. 1,500 Wind turbines.

And THATS JUST THE ATLANTIC OCEAN, WHAT ABOUT THE fucking LIBTARD PACIFIC OCEAN? You don't think mother fucking California isn't going to want FUCKING WIND TURBINE ACTION? You might be like kek I thought they wanted to preserve their coast line or some shit. FUCK NO! They're flippy floppy as fuck and power hungry this is going to happen whether you believe it or not. You don't think GAY PEOPLE are going to want wind turbines? If there's one thing I know about gay people its they love things that twirl, believe me I loved watching these things in the pass twirl as a kid, and my mom would call me a faggot all the time. I REFUSE TO APOLOGIZE FOR THIS!

[https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/02/11/wind-turbines-could-be-coming-to-californias-coast/](https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/02/11/wind-turbines-could-be-coming-to-californias-coast/)

Guess what fucking state is BETTER THAN CALIFORNIA in wind? MOTHER FUCKING BIG ASS TEXAS, the biggest mother fucking state to ever fucking live, 20% of their energy comes from wind ALREADY, what the fuck are you libtards doing?! TEXAS ALREADY LEAVING YOU IN THE DUST. I broke rule 5, what are you going to do about it, not going to wear a mask in my OWN HOUSE EITHER! Now wind turbines froze up for a bit, but guess what, they can be weather proofed so that shit doesn't happen ever again. They have mother fucking weather proofed wind turbines in Antarctica for fuck sakes.

[https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/](https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/)

And this is just the fucking OCEAN TOO! Guess what wind turbines can be put on also instead of water that's fucking right land too and there's plenty of that all the states have it. ^(One thing to note though wind turbines are much more efficient offshore.) Have you looked at the new CS GO MAP DE\_GRIND? THERE'S ALREADY 22 WIND TURBINES ON IT ALREADY, and believe me THEY'RE GOING TO ADD MORE! I CALL VALVE EVERY SINGLE DAMN DAY REQUESTING MORE TURBINES. That has to be a sign right? RIGHT?

And this is only in the fucking US, THERE'S OTHER FUCKING PLACES ALSO GE just partnered with Toshiba. 10 GW OF power buy 2030 1Gw each year in japan! THAT'S A FUCKING TON OF WIND TURBINES, holy shit. Toshiba is going to put a windmill in every single fucking Japan.

\*\*\*\*\*DON'T READ THIS PART UNLESS YOU'RE JIM CRAMER\*\*\*\*\*

>!Look Jim this part is for you, for your eyes only nobody else read I swear to fuck. I am going to need you to go and drain your bank account and put every single last red cent into GE, I feel it, you feel it. You know WSB doesn't give a shit about GE, I get it that's fine they didn't give a shit about GME in the beginning either with strong hard DD from DFV. Is this going to moon? No, but its going to have a sweet sweet dividend soon and a nice gradual increase for the years with other boomers flocking to it, yes. I know your portfolio is maybe 3-5% GE but I am going to need you to drain everything you have and make it 100% maybe even 130% GE why? I don't know I have a raging hard clue about this, I talked to you in my dreams. Did you have the same dream too? Ya, that's what I thought, we can both smell it blowing in the wind.!<

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Then there's SOLAR POWER, look at the 3rd fastest growing job market. GE is in this as well!

And there's so so so much other fucking cool ass shit that GE does, these bitches can make a train did you fucking know that? How bout all the medical tech stuff? They just released a new portable baby scanner.

LOADS OF DEBT being paid off.

Harry Markopolos the guy that caught Bernie Madoff says there's a bunch of fraud. So you know you are really gambling when you buy this stock if he says so. Nobody is trying to squeeze this. If you're a Tesla fanboy this stock probably isn't for you. Tesla and Edison hated each other, does this matter? Probably not, but it makes you wonder.

$8 Billion FREE FLOAT, not all that good BUT I AM USING CAPS, SO GET EXCITED!

$13 something is current price per share ---> 13 is a LUCKY NUMBER.

BILL GATES SAYS %80 wind/solar by 2040 or some shit like that in his book, believe me I read it

Bill Gates also READ Jeff Immelt book believe me I read it on reddit that he read it! he said so himself.

Jeff Immelt also has a tattoo of a fucking meatball on his hip. (previous CEO) Does this matter? Fuck ya it does meatballs are fucking awesome.

If you guys TRULY love risky plays THIS IS FUCKING IT! I don't know if money is going to start coming out of tech and into value, but if it were going to happen, I'd put my money that its going to happen sooner than later.

Every mother fucking state is going to have windmills, 

Once this ball starts to REALLY ROLL its going to ROLL, ROLL straight up that fucking hill and it won't stop, until its down the next hill then ROLLING up the next one then itll roll straight up fucking up MT EVEREST!!!

I AM WAVING THE FUCKING AMERICAN GOD DAMN FLAG RIGHT NOW ALERTING all of you like PAUL f'ing REVERE.

5309,,2021-05-16 23:53:15,t3_ne1fla,,wallstreetbets,"**Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation (Week 5) - $HD, $WMT, $TGT, $LOW, $CSCO, $GOEV, $XL, $SE and More**

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

&nbsp;

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

&nbsp;

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, and checking out my socials, it would mean a lot to me! **Happy Trading Everybody! :)**",ne1fla,"Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation (Week 5) - $HD, $WMT, $TGT, $LOW, $CSCO, $GOEV, $XL, $SE and More"

>Good luck to you, however as a civil engineer I can tell you we don't use concrete to repair bridges and roads.

I'm going to have to disagree with this statement too. Concrete roads (which do exist, not all roads are asphalt) will need to be repaired with concrete. Many bridges are also constructed out of concrete (i.e. for the decks, piers, etc). Many bridges at the very least need repair to spalling concrete to mitigate potential issues from exposed rebar.

>*This includes funding to improve air quality, limit greenhouse gas emissions...*  
  
Concrete is a huge producer of carbon dioxide emissions during manufacturing so that would be pretty ironic...

Your statement about CO2 emissions isn't wrong. However, Cemex has historically received funds from the United States for sustainability goals. So that quote on funding for greenhouse gas emissions research makes me even more bullish on Cemex.

Some people might complain i didn't add traditional dividend aristocrat stocks like O or MO or HML on here - but I like these better and they are paying better yields \*(currently) - I am actually doing this really long project in excel this week, basically copy and pasting alot of data to compare dividend aristocrat stocks to my list and see which would have done better over the past 5 years.....but it's alot of number crunching and building formulas and copy pasta - so i won't be done till i get more time maybe this weekend....if i remember i will paste the final answer - 

If you want to go more traditional aristocrat stocks - just google - top 15 aristocrat stocks. it pops up on the first page and gives you the 15 best dividend stocks \*(but some are definitely not better than my list.....some seem like they might be but I am not done with the project yet.)",,

That guy has a red bandana and the proven gift to make people millionaires, I prefer black bandanas plus he has a degree, or some shit I don't, wish I did, but I don't, yet and that's reality. Look I am going to level with you, I play fast and loose. I don't go with the trends. I am a complete outsider and a rebel. I am heavy long on GE. Do I know what I am talking about? Most likely not, does anyone really know? Make fun of my retarded ass IDGAF!

ADDITIVE EVERYTHING

3D PRINTED AIRPLANE ENGINES this is some futuristic next tech tree shit you only see in Starcraft. Is Ge going to be the first to make a battle cruiser? I don't fucking know, are there going to be Zerg, possibly who the fuck knows in this simulation. You think they're going to just stop there and this brings me to my next point. Air travel is going to start to recover bigly soon.

Renewables

WIND TURBINES these things are so fucking optimized, have you seen the Haliade-x 14Mw of Power. Have you been looking at the news, look in Biden's eyes you can practically see the propeller turning, he just approved of the first farm. These bitches are going to be popping up everywhere offshore. There's already 17 wind farms being planned in the Atlantic ocean. 1,500 Wind turbines. 

[https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/national-international/changing-climate/offshore-wind-turbines-renewable-energy-atlantic-ocean-new-jersey-united-states-climate-change/2723432/](https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/national-international/changing-climate/offshore-wind-turbines-renewable-energy-atlantic-ocean-new-jersey-united-states-climate-change/2723432/)

And THATS JUST THE ATLANTIC OCEAN, WHAT ABOUT THE fucking LIBTARD PACIFIC OCEAN? You don't think mother fucking California isn't going to want FUCKING WIND TURBINE ACTION? You might be like kek I thought they wanted to preserve their coast line or some shit. FUCK NO! They're flippy floppy as fuck and power hungry this is going to happen whether you believe it or not. You don't think GAY PEOPLE are going to want wind turbines? If there's one thing I know about gay people its they love things that twirl, believe me I loved watching these things in the pass twirl as a kid, and my mom would call me a faggot all the time. I REFUSE TO APOLOGIZE FOR THIS!

[https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/02/11/wind-turbines-could-be-coming-to-californias-coast/](https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/02/11/wind-turbines-could-be-coming-to-californias-coast/)

Guess what fucking state is BETTER THAN CALIFORNIA in wind? MOTHER FUCKING BIG ASS TEXAS, the biggest mother fucking state to ever fucking live, 20% of their energy comes from wind ALREADY, what the fuck are you libtards doing?! TEXAS ALREADY LEAVING YOU IN THE DUST. I broke rule 5, what are you going to do about it, not going to wear a mask in my OWN HOUSE EITHER! Now wind turbines froze up for a bit, but guess what, they can be weather proofed so that shit doesn't happen ever again. They have mother fucking weather proofed wind turbines in Antarctica for fuck sakes.

[https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/](https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/)

And this is just the fucking OCEAN TOO! Guess what wind turbines can be put on also instead of water that's fucking right land too and there's plenty of that all the states have it. ^(One thing to note though wind turbines are much more efficient offshore.) Have you looked at the new CS GO MAP DE\_GRIND? THERE'S ALREADY 22 WIND TURBINES ON IT ALREADY, and believe me THEY'RE GOING TO ADD MORE! I CALL VALVE EVERY SINGLE DAMN DAY REQUESTING MORE TURBINES. That has to be a sign right? RIGHT?

And this is only in the fucking US, THERE'S OTHER FUCKING PLACES ALSO GE just partnered with Toshiba. 10 GW OF power buy 2030 1Gw each year in japan! THAT'S A FUCKING TON OF WIND TURBINES, holy shit. Toshiba is going to put a windmill in every single fucking Japan.

LOOK AT THE FUCKING Gosh dang fastest growing job market right now over the next 10 years. Does that account for anything? Am I the only one that can see the writing on the wall? Am I 6th Sense retarded?!?!

\*\*\*\*\*DON'T READ THIS PART UNLESS YOU'RE JIM CRAMER\*\*\*\*\*

>!Look Jim this part is for you, for your eyes only nobody else read I swear to fuck. I am going to need you to go and drain your bank account and put every single last red cent into GE, I feel it, you feel it. You know WSB doesn't give a shit about GE, I get it that's fine they didn't give a shit about GME in the beginning either with strong hard DD from DFV. Is this going to moon? No, but its going to have a sweet sweet dividend soon and a nice gradual increase for the years with other boomers flocking to it, yes. I know your portfolio is maybe 3-5% GE but I am going to need you to drain everything you have and make it 100% maybe even 130% GE why? I don't know I have a raging hard clue about this, I talked to you in my dreams. Did you have the same dream too? Ya, that's what I thought, we can both smell it blowing in the wind.!<

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Then there's SOLAR POWER, look at the 3rd fastest growing job market. GE is in this as well!

And there's so so so much other fucking cool ass shit that GE does, these bitches can make a train did you fucking know that? How bout all the medical tech stuff? They just released a new portable baby scanner.

LOADS OF DEBT being paid off.

Harry Markopolos the guy that caught Bernie Madoff says there's a bunch of fraud. So you know you are really gambling when you buy this stock if he says so. Nobody is trying to squeeze this. If you're a Tesla fanboy this stock probably isn't for you. Tesla and Edison hated each other, does this matter? Probably not, but it makes you wonder.

$8 Billion FREE FLOAT, not all that good BUT I AM USING CAPS, SO GET EXCITED!

$13 something is current price per share ---> 13 is a LUCKY NUMBER.

BILL GATES SAYS %80 wind/solar by 2040 or some shit like that in his book, believe me I read it

Bill Gates also READ Jeff Immelt book believe me I read it on reddit that he read it! he said so himself.

Jeff Immelt also has a tattoo of a fucking meatball on his hip. (previous CEO) Does this matter? Fuck ya it does meatballs are fucking awesome.

If you guys TRULY love risky plays THIS IS FUCKING IT! I don't know if money is going to start coming out of tech and into value, but if it were going to happen, I'd put my money that its going to happen sooner than later.

Every mother fucking state is going to have windmills, 

Once this ball starts to REALLY ROLL its going to ROLL, ROLL straight up that fucking hill and it won't stop, until its down the next hill then ROLLING up the next one then itll roll straight up fucking up MT EVEREST!!!

I AM WAVING THE FUCKING AMERICAN GOD DAMN FLAG RIGHT NOW ALERTING all of you like PAUL f'ing REVERE. 

If you hate the thought of America creating more job then don't buy. 

If you don't buy GE then you must hate America.  Why do you hate America so much?",ndxk81,"Serious discussion, no seriously please about GE. I know you hate it. Real Financial advice at the tippy top."

The key here is Time,, Musk said recently that he needs o speed up the time because he doesn‚Äôt want to run out of time for mars..  There is much to do and he needs Starlink to speed up and provide The cash for other projects...  I thought this was crazy originally but if you look at the interview from 9 months ago even he talks about Musk and that he would be open to it so why would everyone else say no... Also I really have a hard time thinking that someone like BA would do the largest SPAC ever with out his own massive DD and high possibility that this would go through? its very possible that Reddit is right on this..  maybe more than Stripe, Bloomberg or Fidelity..

ADDITIVE EVERYTHING

3D PRINTED AIRPLANE ENGINES this is some futuristic next tech tree shit you only see in Starcraft. Is Ge going to be the first to make a battle cruiser? I don't fucking know, are there going to be Zerg, possibly who the fuck knows in this simulation. You think they're going to just stop there and this brings me to my next point. Air travel is going to start to recover bigly soon.

Renewables

WIND TURBINES these things are so fucking optimized, have you seen the Haliade-x 14Mw of Power. Have you been looking at the news, look in Biden's eyes you can practically see the propeller turning, he just approved of the first farm. These bitches are going to be popping up everywhere offshore. There's already 17 wind farms being planned in the Atlantic ocean. 1,500 Wind turbines.

And THATS JUST THE ATLANTIC OCEAN, WHAT ABOUT THE fucking LIBTARD PACIFIC OCEAN? You don't think mother fucking California isn't going to want FUCKING WIND TURBINE ACTION? You might be like kek I thought they wanted to preserve their coast line or some shit. FUCK NO! They're flippy floppy as fuck and power hungry this is going to happen whether you believe it or not. You don't think GAY PEOPLE are going to want wind turbines? If there's one thing I know about gay people its they love things that twirl, believe me I loved watching these things in the pass twirl as a kid, and my mom would call me a faggot all the time. I REFUSE TO APOLOGIZE FOR THIS!

Guess what fucking state is BETTER THAN CALIFORNIA in wind? MOTHER FUCKING BIG ASS TEXAS, the biggest mother fucking state to ever fucking live, 20% of their energy comes from wind ALREADY, what the fuck are you libtards doing?! TEXAS ALREADY LEAVING YOU IN THE DUST. I broke rule 5, what are you going to do about it, not going to wear a mask in my OWN HOUSE EITHER! Now wind turbines froze up for a bit, but guess what, they can be weather proofed so that shit doesn't happen ever again. They have mother fucking weather proofed wind turbines in Antarctica for fuck sakes.

[https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/](https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/)

And this is just the fucking OCEAN TOO! Guess what wind turbines can be put on also instead of water that's fucking right land too and there's plenty of that all the states have it. ^(One thing to note though wind turbines are much more efficient offshore.) Have you looked at the new CS GO MAP DE\_GRIND? THERE'S ALREADY 22 WIND TURBINES ON IT ALREADY, and believe me THEY'RE GOING TO ADD MORE! I CALL VALVE EVERY SINGLE DAMN DAY REQUESTING MORE TURBINES. That has to be a sign right? RIGHT?

And this is only in the fucking US, THERE'S OTHER FUCKING PLACES ALSO GE just partnered with Toshiba. 10 GW OF power buy 2030 1Gw each year in japan! THAT'S A FUCKING TON OF WIND TURBINES, holy shit. Toshiba is going to put a windmill in every single fucking Japan.

No, but its going to have a sweet sweet dividend soon and a nice gradual increase for the years with other boomers flocking to it, yes. I know your portfolio is maybe 3-5% GE but I am going to need you to drain everything you have and make it 100% maybe even 130% GE why? I don't know I have a raging hard clue about this, I talked to you in my dreams. Did you have the same dream too? Ya, that's what I thought, we can both smell it blowing in the wind.!<

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Then there's SOLAR POWER, look at the 3rd fastest growing job market. GE is in this as well!

And there's so so so much other fucking cool ass shit that GE does, these bitches can make a train did you fucking know that? How bout all the medical tech stuff? They just released a new portable baby scanner.

LOADS OF DEBT being paid off.

Harry Markopolos the guy that caught Bernie Madoff says there's a bunch of fraud. So you know you are really gambling when you buy this stock if he says so. Nobody is trying to squeeze this. If you're a Tesla fanboy this stock probably isn't for you. Tesla and Edison hated each other, does this matter? Probably not, but it makes you wonder.

$8 Billion FREE FLOAT, not all that good BUT I AM USING CAPS, SO GET EXCITED!

$13 something is current price per share ---> 13 is a LUCKY NUMBER.

BILL GATES SAYS %80 wind/solar by 2040 or some shit like that in his book, believe me I read it

Bill Gates also READ Jeff Immelt book believe me I read it on reddit that he read it! he said so himself.

Jeff Immelt also has a tattoo of a fucking meatball on his hip. (previous CEO) Does this matter? Fuck ya it does meatballs are fucking awesome.

If you guys TRULY love risky plays THIS IS FUCKING IT! I don't know if money is going to start coming out of tech and into value, but if it were going to happen, I'd put my money that its going to happen sooner than later.

Every mother fucking state is going to have windmills, 

Once this ball starts to REALLY ROLL its going to ROLL, ROLL straight up that fucking hill and it won't stop, until its down the next hill then ROLLING up the next one then itll roll straight up fucking up MT EVEREST!!!

I AM WAVING THE FUCKING AMERICAN GOD DAMN FLAG RIGHT NOW ALERTING all of you like PAUL f'ing REVERE. 

If you hate the thought of America creating more job then don't buy. 

If you don't buy GE then you must hate America.  Why do you hate America so much?",ndxk81,"Serious discussion, no seriously please about GE. I know you hate it. Real Financial advice at the tippy top."

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

&nbsp;

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

&nbsp;

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, and checking out my socials, it would mean a lot to me! **Happy Trading Everybody! :)**",ne1fla,"Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation (Week 5) - $HD, $WMT, $TGT, $LOW, $CSCO, $GOEV, $XL, $SE and More"

ADDITIVE EVERYTHING

3D PRINTED AIRPLANE ENGINES this is some futuristic next tech tree shit you only see in Starcraft. Is Ge going to be the first to make a battle cruiser? I don't fucking know, are there going to be Zerg, possibly who the fuck knows in this simulation. You think they're going to just stop there and this brings me to my next point. Air travel is going to start to recover bigly soon.

Renewables

WIND TURBINES these things are so fucking optimized, have you seen the Haliade-x 14Mw of Power. Have you been looking at the news, look in Biden's eyes you can practically see the propeller turning, he just approved of the first farm. These bitches are going to be popping up everywhere offshore. There's already 17 wind farms being planned in the Atlantic ocean. 1,500 Wind turbines.

And THATS JUST THE ATLANTIC OCEAN, WHAT ABOUT THE fucking LIBTARD PACIFIC OCEAN? You don't think mother fucking California isn't going to want FUCKING WIND TURBINE ACTION? You might be like kek I thought they wanted to preserve their coast line or some shit. FUCK NO! They're flippy floppy as fuck and power hungry this is going to happen whether you believe it or not. You don't think GAY PEOPLE are going to want wind turbines? If there's one thing I know about gay people its they love things that twirl, believe me I loved watching these things in the pass twirl as a kid, and my mom would call me a faggot all the time. I REFUSE TO APOLOGIZE FOR THIS!

Guess what fucking state is BETTER THAN CALIFORNIA in wind? MOTHER FUCKING BIG ASS TEXAS, the biggest mother fucking state to ever fucking live, 20% of their energy comes from wind ALREADY, what the fuck are you libtards doing?! TEXAS ALREADY LEAVING YOU IN THE DUST. I broke rule 5, what are you going to do about it, not going to wear a mask in my OWN HOUSE EITHER! Now wind turbines froze up for a bit, but guess what, they can be weather proofed so that shit doesn't happen ever again. They have mother fucking weather proofed wind turbines in Antarctica for fuck sakes.

[https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/](https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/)

And this is just the fucking OCEAN TOO! Guess what wind turbines can be put on also instead of water that's fucking right land too and there's plenty of that all the states have it. ^(One thing to note though wind turbines are much more efficient offshore.) Have you looked at the new CS GO MAP DE\_GRIND? THERE'S ALREADY 22 WIND TURBINES ON IT ALREADY, and believe me THEY'RE GOING TO ADD MORE! I CALL VALVE EVERY SINGLE DAMN DAY REQUESTING MORE TURBINES. That has to be a sign right? RIGHT?

And this is only in the fucking US, THERE'S OTHER FUCKING PLACES ALSO GE just partnered with Toshiba. 10 GW OF power buy 2030 1Gw each year in japan! THAT'S A FUCKING TON OF WIND TURBINES, holy shit. Toshiba is going to put a windmill in every single fucking Japan.

I am going to need you to go and drain your bank account and put every single last red cent into GE, I feel it, you feel it. You know WSB doesn't give a shit about GE, I get it that's fine they didn't give a shit about GME in the beginning either with strong hard DD from DFV. Is this going to moon? No, but its going to have a sweet sweet dividend soon and a nice gradual increase for the years with other boomers flocking to it, yes. I know your portfolio is maybe 3-5% GE but I am going to need you to drain everything you have and make it 100% maybe even 130% GE why? I don't know I have a raging hard clue about this, I talked to you in my dreams. Did you have the same dream too? Ya, that's what I thought, we can both smell it blowing in the wind.!<

Then there's SOLAR POWER, look at the 3rd fastest growing job market. GE is in this as well!

And there's so so so much other fucking cool ass shit that GE does, these bitches can make a train did you fucking know that? How bout all the medical tech stuff? They just released a new portable baby scanner.

LOADS OF DEBT being paid off.

Harry Markopolos the guy that caught Bernie Madoff says there's a bunch of fraud. So you know you are really gambling when you buy this stock if he says so. Nobody is trying to squeeze this. If you're a Tesla fanboy this stock probably isn't for you. Tesla and Edison hated each other, does this matter? Probably not, but it makes you wonder.

$8 Billion FREE FLOAT, not all that good BUT I AM USING CAPS, SO GET EXCITED!

$13 something is current price per share ---> 13 is a LUCKY NUMBER.

BILL GATES SAYS %80 wind/solar by 2040 or some shit like that in his book, believe me I read it

Bill Gates also READ Jeff Immelt book believe me I read it on reddit that he read it! he said so himself.

Jeff Immelt also has a tattoo of a fucking meatball on his hip. (previous CEO) Does this matter? Fuck ya it does meatballs are fucking awesome.

If you guys TRULY love risky plays THIS IS FUCKING IT! I don't know if money is going to start coming out of tech and into value, but if it were going to happen, I'd put my money that its going to happen sooner than later.

Every mother fucking state is going to have windmills, 

Once this ball starts to REALLY ROLL its going to ROLL, ROLL straight up that fucking hill and it won't stop, until its down the next hill then ROLLING up the next one then itll roll straight up fucking up MT EVEREST!!!

I AM WAVING THE FUCKING AMERICAN GOD DAMN FLAG RIGHT NOW ALERTING all of you like PAUL f'ing REVERE.

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

&nbsp;

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

&nbsp;

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season!

[**Anders Bylund**](https://boards.fool.com/profile/TMFZahrim/info.aspx) **(Nokia):** Few tech stocks have weathered the recent market storm quite like Finnish telecom infrastructure veteran Nokia. The stock has gained 32% since the New Year, including a 14% jump over the last 30 days. By contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is trading flat in 2021 and fell 7% in the last month.

This stock may feel like a joke due to the recent influx of Nokia interest from the Reddit-based WallStreetBets group, but that's just a coincidence. Nokia's real-world business prospects are solid and the stock is actually undervalued, even though it dodged the tech-stock market correction in recent months.

Nokia's solid market position was built on a foundation of [5G network](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) installations. Top-line sales are rising faster than expected, Nokia's profit margin is expanding as we speak thanks to the richer product mix, and the stock is changing hands for less than eight times free cash flow. You don't see that combination of deep-discount stock prices and robust business trends very often, and that makes Nokia a no-brainer buy right now.",ne3k42,Nokia an industry leader in the bargain bin

Home Depot reports earnings premarket 5/18. HD has beat earnings consistently and the share price has reacted negatively each time. In this market I feel like the play here is a strangle. My proposed play is the closest to the money strikes. Right now based on $324 list that would be the 5/21 323.5P/325C. You are in for about $1k. Break even is 3% in either direction. Of course we are hoping for 6% at least.

November earnings was a beat and the stock dropped 6% that day. That would be 100% profit with the trade I propose for educational purposes only. The previous report had a -3.2% drop that day which would still print.

Here is the kicker. The 5 day high is $344 (5/10) and low $317 (5/12) for a 2 day swing of 8.4% bases on Friday close. This is key because it means there is the potential for both sides of the strangle to be profitable prior to expiration! Nuts right?

Here is how to play it. Watch the housing report tomorrow (5/17). With lumber prices being insane new construction might be a miss. If HD stock goes down you will need to consider if the market will price this in when digesting an earnings miss. You will want to wait until the end of the day to enter the strangle to make sure you have strikes that put the Monday close in the middle.

If earnings are a beat and the prices goes up >3% sell the call once you are happy with the profit. Lock in your tuition money because again, this is for education. Same goes for the inverse. Then you have until Friday to try to get tendies with the other side. Can't remember the Vince Vaughn line from Dodge ball but it think it's ""that's what we call the jackpot"".

Not WSB material you say? Earnings plays are inherently gambling and sir, this is a casino.

Positions: none yet. Ask me at 3PM tomorrow you illiterate ape.

TLDR: Home Depot is usually located in  very close proximity to a Wendy's = tendies.

6014,,2021-05-17 06:09:30,t3_ne8d41,,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm seeing macro trendlines of around 6 months (beginning November 6th, connecting around February 5th, and testing resistance right around now) in most of these stocks. 

Friday, I decided to load up on 1-2 week out OTM calls (at strikes probably around 10%-30% above the current market value). I‚Äôll be throwing a couple grand a week at this trade til it hits! 

MGM, NCLH, BA, BP are my picks. Each from a different industry, positively impacted by the reopening and ensuing pent-up demand of the economy. I‚Äôm swinging for the MIL on this! 

I‚Äôm a bull here for technical reasons. However, the fundamentals make sense here now as well. The current bull-market trendlines on all the reopen stonks started with a vaccine announcement on November 9th in the early A.M. (the freaking insiders bought/drove up prices before the market opened, that sucked).

The CDC letting ‚Äúvaccinated‚Äù people stop social distancing has majorly positive implications for the economy. Think of traveling, think of the impeding Memorial Day weekend...

Go check out the 1-year, 1-day charts for these stocks, and draw a line from the close on November 6th to now. I think we see 30% or more gains in the value of these stocks the next couple weeks.

For those of you who read my initial post ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lq63av/dd_on_agrify_agfy_indoor_cannabis_growing/)) at the end of Feb laying out my bull case - or should I say my case of low-functioning autism - I ate my own cooking and massively increased my position size since then - from 1,794 to 23,777 shares. I was buying every fucking dip over the past two weeks in $10k increments until I was tapped out of brokerage cash and about to dip into margin. Whether I am retarded enough to do that shall remain to be seen, stay tuned.

But my call on AGFY still stands today - that this stock is massively undervalued. With $137m in cash and valued at $154m as of today, they are valued ex-cash at $17m on a revenue run rate of $30m+ this year. You have to be on a different level of stupid to see that this stock is mis-priced. If you don't want to read my initial DD, Agrify basically is combining AI/SaaS with cannabis cultivation, perfecting grow environments and increasing cannabis yields for the growers who use their technology.

It's the type of company that gets Cathy Wood and ARK wet as a cucumber, and I wouldn't be surprised if they've been vetting the stock for their portfolio. Cannabis is here to stay, and in the long run the federal government will have no other choice but to legalize weed at the federal level to increase tax revenue to pay for all the brrrr money printing that JPow and his cronies have done. Enough said, I'm going to drink some fine bourbon and continue to gaze steely-eyed at my losses. Here's to being fucking retarded! Will continue to post monthly updates on my position.

6204,,2021-05-16 16:51:38,t3_ndsgrw,,wallstreetbets,"Sup ya'll. I was reading through Roblox investors relations and thought it was note-worthy that this company is not doing traditional quarterly reports and will instead run with monthly reports as a way to be transparent about company progress with respect to bookings, which is their main financial metric outside and of revenue/engagement/developer share.

I expect that this is going to produce some pretty intense price action. I follow this company closely as both an investor and Roblox developer and thought this strategy was quite interesting.

I personally hold a really bullish view on this company. I believe that engagement will go up a lot this summer rather than the somewhat expected decline across some media markets that mostly cater to young adults/working adults.

Kids main consumption/engagement in the market is staying in and playing video games since schooling responsibility is gone. Even when school returns, it's a place for kids to congregate and talk about this stuff. 

# Roblox is basically Instagram for kids and Dave Baszucki isn't a FREAK like ZUCKERBORG. Similar jealousy incentives behind Roblox too. Every kid wants to look unique and not like a default baconhead if you know what I mean.


> Well, envy/jealousy made, what, two out of the ten commandments? Those of you who have raised siblings you know about envy, or tried to run a law firm or investment bank or even a faculty? Ive heard Warren say a half a dozen times, 'Its not greed that drives the world, but envy."" - Charlie Munger 

I wrote super epic 10 page DD on Roblox on the long-term view on the  Developer Studio in case this subject is of interest to anyone. But I'm scared to post it because I might get slam dunked by the automod for the 20 billionth time.

And before you say ""oh ya it's so overvalued it's market cap is bigger than X, Y, and Z"" just take a damn moment to consider that the target market is obviously children, of which there are billions of them. These are customers whose core spend include:

1. Eating and staying alive
2. Clothes
3. Toys 
4. Education

Roblox belongs in categories 2, 3, and 4. Legos earns 5 billion in revenue while Blizzard earns 8 billion. Do the math, the company has potential.",ndsgrw,Roblox will be volatile in 2021 due to monthly reporting over quarterly reports.

I was reading through Roblox investors relations and thought it was note-worthy that this company is not doing traditional quarterly reports and will instead run with monthly reports as a way to be transparent about company progress with respect to bookings, which is their main financial metric outside and of revenue/engagement/developer share.

I expect that this is going to produce some pretty intense price action. I follow this company closely as both an investor and Roblox developer and thought this strategy was quite interesting.

I personally hold a really bullish view on this company. I believe that engagement will go up a lot this summer rather than the somewhat expected decline across some media markets that mostly cater to young adults/working adults.

Kids main consumption/engagement in the market is staying in and playing video games since schooling responsibility is gone. Even when school returns, it's a place for kids to congregate and talk about this stuff. 

# Roblox is basically Instagram for kids and Dave Baszucki isn't a FREAK like ZUCKERBORG. Similar jealousy incentives behind Roblox too. Every kid wants to look unique and not like a default baconhead if you know what I mean.


> Well, envy/jealousy made, what, two out of the ten commandments? Those of you who have raised siblings you know about envy, or tried to run a law firm or investment bank or even a faculty? Ive heard Warren say a half a dozen times, 'Its not greed that drives the world, but envy."" - Charlie Munger 

I wrote super epic 10 page DD on Roblox on the long-term view on the  Developer Studio in case this subject is of interest to anyone. But I'm scared to post it because I might get slam dunked by the automod for the 20 billionth time.

And before you say ""oh ya it's so overvalued it's market cap is bigger than X, Y, and Z"" just take a damn moment to consider that the target market is obviously children, of which there are billions of them. These are customers whose core spend include:

1. Eating and staying alive
2. Clothes

Not a whole lot of people will claim this so boldly, am I DFV? Fuck no! That guy has a red bandana and the proven gift to make people millionaires, I prefer black bandanas plus he has a degree, or some shit I don't, wish I did, but I don't, yet and that's reality. Look I am going to level with you, I play fast and loose. I don't go with the trends. I am a complete outsider and a rebel. I am heavy long on GE. Do I know what I am talking about? Most likely not, does anyone really know? Make fun of my retarded ass IDGAF!

Its one of the most American Companies around, even more American than Mcdonalds and Coca Cola **combined**. In my opinion THE BEST industrial Giant!!!!!!

ADDITIVE EVERYTHING

3D PRINTED AIRPLANE ENGINES this is some futuristic next tech tree shit you only see in Starcraft. Is Ge going to be the first to make a battle cruiser? I don't fucking know, are there going to be Zerg, possibly who the fuck knows in this simulation. You think they're going to just stop there and this brings me to my next point. Air travel is going to start to recover bigly soon.

Renewables

WIND TURBINES these things are so fucking optimized, have you seen the Haliade-x 14Mw of Power. Have you been looking at the news, look in Biden's eyes you can practically see the propeller turning, he just approved of the first farm. These bitches are going to be popping up everywhere offshore. There's already 17 wind farms being planned in the Atlantic ocean. 1,500 Wind turbines. 

[https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/national-international/changing-climate/offshore-wind-turbines-renewable-energy-atlantic-ocean-new-jersey-united-states-climate-change/2723432/](https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/national-international/changing-climate/offshore-wind-turbines-renewable-energy-atlantic-ocean-new-jersey-united-states-climate-change/2723432/)

And THATS JUST THE ATLANTIC OCEAN, WHAT ABOUT THE fucking LIBTARD PACIFIC OCEAN? You don't think mother fucking California isn't going to want FUCKING WIND TURBINE ACTION? You might be like kek I thought they wanted to preserve their coast line or some shit. FUCK NO! They're flippy floppy as fuck and power hungry this is going to happen whether you believe it or not. You don't think GAY PEOPLE are going to want wind turbines? If there's one thing I know about gay people its they love things that twirl, believe me I loved watching these things in the pass twirl as a kid, and my mom would call me a faggot all the time. I REFUSE TO APOLOGIZE FOR THIS!

[https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/02/11/wind-turbines-could-be-coming-to-californias-coast/](https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/02/11/wind-turbines-could-be-coming-to-californias-coast/)

Guess what fucking state is BETTER THAN CALIFORNIA in wind? MOTHER FUCKING BIG ASS TEXAS, the biggest mother fucking state to ever fucking live, 20% of their energy comes from wind ALREADY, what the fuck are you libtards doing?! TEXAS ALREADY LEAVING YOU IN THE DUST. I broke rule 5, what are you going to do about it, not going to wear a mask in my OWN HOUSE EITHER! Now wind turbines froze up for a bit, but guess what, they can be weather proofed so that shit doesn't happen ever again. They have mother fucking weather proofed wind turbines in Antarctica for fuck sakes.

[https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/](https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/)

And this is just the fucking OCEAN TOO! Guess what wind turbines can be put on also instead of water that's fucking right land too and there's plenty of that all the states have it. ^(One thing to note though wind turbines are much more efficient offshore.) Have you looked at the new CS GO MAP DE\_GRIND? THERE'S ALREADY 22 WIND TURBINES ON IT ALREADY, and believe me THEY'RE GOING TO ADD MORE! I CALL VALVE EVERY SINGLE DAMN DAY REQUESTING MORE TURBINES. That has to be a sign right? RIGHT?

And this is only in the fucking US, THERE'S OTHER FUCKING PLACES ALSO GE just partnered with Toshiba. 10 GW OF power buy 2030 1Gw each year in japan! THAT'S A FUCKING TON OF WIND TURBINES, holy shit. Toshiba is going to put a windmill in every single fucking Japan.

LOOK AT THE FUCKING Gosh dang fastest growing job market right now over the next 10 years. Does that account for anything? Am I the only one that can see the writing on the wall? Am I 6th Sense retarded?!?!

\*\*\*\*\*DON'T READ THIS PART UNLESS YOU'RE JIM CRAMER\*\*\*\*\*

>!Look Jim this part is for you, for your eyes only nobody else read I swear to fuck. I am going to need you to go and drain your bank account and put every single last red cent into GE, I feel it, you feel it. You know WSB doesn't give a shit about GE, I get it that's fine they didn't give a shit about GME in the beginning either with strong hard DD from DFV. Is this going to moon? No, but its going to have a sweet sweet dividend soon and a nice gradual increase for the years with other boomers flocking to it, yes. I know your portfolio is maybe 3-5% GE but I am going to need you to drain everything you have and make it 100% maybe even 130% GE why? I don't know I have a raging hard clue about this, I talked to you in my dreams. Did you have the same dream too? Ya, that's what I thought, we can both smell it blowing in the wind.!<

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Then there's SOLAR POWER, look at the 3rd fastest growing job market. GE is in this as well!

And there's so so so much other fucking cool ass shit that GE does, these bitches can make a train did you fucking know that? How bout all the medical tech stuff? They just released a new portable baby scanner.

LOADS OF DEBT being paid off.

Harry Markopolos the guy that caught Bernie Madoff says there's a bunch of fraud. So you know you are really gambling when you buy this stock if he says so. Nobody is trying to squeeze this. If you're a Tesla fanboy this stock probably isn't for you. Tesla and Edison hated each other, does this matter? Probably not, but it makes you wonder.

$8 Billion FREE FLOAT, not all that good BUT I AM USING CAPS, SO GET EXCITED!

$13 something is current price per share ---> 13 is a LUCKY NUMBER.

BILL GATES SAYS %80 wind/solar by 2040 or some shit like that in his book, believe me I read it

Bill Gates also READ Jeff Immelt book believe me I read it on reddit that he read it! he said so himself.

Jeff Immelt also has a tattoo of a fucking meatball on his hip. (previous CEO) Does this matter? Fuck ya it does meatballs are fucking awesome.

If you guys TRULY love risky plays THIS IS FUCKING IT! I don't know if money is going to start coming out of tech and into value, but if it were going to happen, I'd put my money that its going to happen sooner than later.

Every mother fucking state is going to have windmills, 

Once this ball starts to REALLY ROLL its going to ROLL, ROLL straight up that fucking hill and it won't stop, until its down the next hill then ROLLING up the next one then itll roll straight up fucking up MT EVEREST!!!

I AM WAVING THE FUCKING AMERICAN GOD DAMN FLAG RIGHT NOW ALERTING all of you like PAUL f'ing REVERE. 

If you hate the thought of America creating more job then don't buy. 

If you don't buy GE then you must hate America.  Why do you hate America so much?",ndxk81,"Serious discussion, no seriously please about GE. I know you hate it. Real Financial advice at the tippy top."

I know RKT guidance is down but 


- the P/E ratio of under 7 is extremely cheap

- They have a great current ratio

- They are profitable which is great during inflation times like now. Revenue and earnings are steady in guidance for the next two years 

- Possible addition to S&P 500

- Dominant name in the industry

Have you been looking at the news, look in Biden's eyes you can practically see the propeller turning, he just approved of the first farm.

If there's one thing I know about gay people its they love things that twirl, believe me I loved watching these things in the pass twirl as a kid, and my mom would call me a faggot all the time. I REFUSE TO APOLOGIZE FOR THIS!

[https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/02/11/wind-turbines-could-be-coming-to-californias-coast/](https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/02/11/wind-turbines-could-be-coming-to-californias-coast/)

Guess what fucking state is BETTER THAN CALIFORNIA in wind? MOTHER FUCKING BIG ASS TEXAS, the biggest mother fucking state to ever fucking live, 20% of their energy comes from wind ALREADY, what the fuck are you libtards doing?! TEXAS ALREADY LEAVING YOU IN THE DUST. I broke rule 5, what are you going to do about it, not going to wear a mask in my OWN HOUSE EITHER! Now wind turbines froze up for a bit, but guess what, they can be weather proofed so that shit doesn't happen ever again. They have mother fucking weather proofed wind turbines in Antarctica for fuck sakes.

[https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/](https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/)

And this is just the fucking OCEAN TOO! Guess what wind turbines can be put on also instead of water that's fucking right land too and there's plenty of that all the states have it. ^(One thing to note though wind turbines are much more efficient offshore.) Have you looked at the new CS GO MAP DE\_GRIND? THERE'S ALREADY 22 WIND TURBINES ON IT ALREADY, and believe me THEY'RE GOING TO ADD MORE! I CALL VALVE EVERY SINGLE DAMN DAY REQUESTING MORE TURBINES. That has to be a sign right? RIGHT?

And this is only in the fucking US, THERE'S OTHER FUCKING PLACES ALSO GE just partnered with Toshiba. 10 GW OF power buy 2030 1Gw each year in japan! THAT'S A FUCKING TON OF WIND TURBINES, holy shit. Toshiba is going to put a windmill in every single fucking Japan.

LOOK AT THE FUCKING Gosh dang fastest growing job market right now over the next 10 years. Does that account for anything? Am I the only one that can see the writing on the wall? Am I 6th Sense retarded?!?!

\*\*\*\*\*DON'T READ THIS PART UNLESS YOU'RE JIM CRAMER\*\*\*\*\*

>!Look Jim this part is for you, for your eyes only nobody else read I swear to fuck. I am going to need you to go and drain your bank account and put every single last red cent into GE, I feel it, you feel it. You know WSB doesn't give a shit about GE, I get it that's fine they didn't give a shit about GME in the beginning either with strong hard DD from DFV. Is this going to moon? No, but its going to have a sweet sweet dividend soon and a nice gradual increase for the years with other boomers flocking to it, yes. I know your portfolio is maybe 3-5% GE but I am going to need you to drain everything you have and make it 100% maybe even 130% GE why? I don't know I have a raging hard clue about this, I talked to you in my dreams. Did you have the same dream too? Ya, that's what I thought, we can both smell it blowing in the wind.!<

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Then there's SOLAR POWER, look at the 3rd fastest growing job market. GE is in this as well!

And there's so so so much other fucking cool ass shit that GE does, these bitches can make a train did you fucking know that? How bout all the medical tech stuff? They just released a new portable baby scanner.

LOADS OF DEBT being paid off.

Harry Markopolos the guy that caught Bernie Madoff says there's a bunch of fraud. So you know you are really gambling when you buy this stock if he says so. Nobody is trying to squeeze this. If you're a Tesla fanboy this stock probably isn't for you. Tesla and Edison hated each other, does this matter? Probably not, but it makes you wonder.

$8 Billion FREE FLOAT, not all that good BUT I AM USING CAPS, SO GET EXCITED!

$13 something is current price per share ---> 13 is a LUCKY NUMBER.

BILL GATES SAYS %80 wind/solar by 2040 or some shit like that in his book, believe me I read it

Bill Gates also READ Jeff Immelt book believe me I read it on reddit that he read it! he said so himself.

Jeff Immelt also has a tattoo of a fucking meatball on his hip. (previous CEO) Does this matter? Fuck ya it does meatballs are fucking awesome.

If you guys TRULY love risky plays THIS IS FUCKING IT! I don't know if money is going to start coming out of tech and into value, but if it were going to happen, I'd put my money that its going to happen sooner than later.

Every mother fucking state is going to have windmills, 

Once this ball starts to REALLY ROLL its going to ROLL, ROLL straight up that fucking hill and it won't stop, until its down the next hill then ROLLING up the next one then itll roll straight up fucking up MT EVEREST!!!

I AM WAVING THE FUCKING AMERICAN GOD DAMN FLAG RIGHT NOW ALERTING all of you like PAUL f'ing REVERE. 

If you hate the thought of America creating more job then don't buy. 

If you don't buy GE then you must hate America.  Why do you hate America so much?",ndxk81,"Serious discussion, no seriously please about GE. I know you hate it. Real Financial advice at the tippy top."

Anyway, I don't know how things work, it just seems like I made a few mistakes and I can learn from them, but no one should be telling me to not trade.  It's something I'm very passionate about.  There seems to be a ceiling on GME around 200 right now, I don't know why, no one wants to hold the bag that high?  Any way, if you sell around 185 to 200, you'll be alright, after that, who knows what will happen with GME.

ADDITIVE EVERYTHING

3D PRINTED AIRPLANE ENGINES this is some futuristic next tech tree shit you only see in Starcraft. Is Ge going to be the first to make a battle cruiser? I don't fucking know, are there going to be Zerg, possibly who the fuck knows in this simulation. You think they're going to just stop there and this brings me to my next point. Air travel is going to start to recover bigly soon.

Renewables

WIND TURBINES these things are so fucking optimized, have you seen the Haliade-x 14Mw of Power. Have you been looking at the news, look in Biden's eyes you can practically see the propeller turning, he just approved of the first farm. These bitches are going to be popping up everywhere offshore. There's already 17 wind farms being planned in the Atlantic ocean. 1,500 Wind turbines.

And THATS JUST THE ATLANTIC OCEAN, WHAT ABOUT THE fucking LIBTARD PACIFIC OCEAN? You don't think mother fucking California isn't going to want FUCKING WIND TURBINE ACTION? You might be like kek I thought they wanted to preserve their coast line or some shit. FUCK NO! They're flippy floppy as fuck and power hungry this is going to happen whether you believe it or not. You don't think GAY PEOPLE are going to want wind turbines? If there's one thing I know about gay people its they love things that twirl, believe me I loved watching these things in the pass twirl as a kid, and my mom would call me a faggot all the time. I REFUSE TO APOLOGIZE FOR THIS!

Guess what fucking state is BETTER THAN CALIFORNIA in wind? MOTHER FUCKING BIG ASS TEXAS, the biggest mother fucking state to ever fucking live, 20% of their energy comes from wind ALREADY, what the fuck are you libtards doing?! TEXAS ALREADY LEAVING YOU IN THE DUST. I broke rule 5, what are you going to do about it, not going to wear a mask in my OWN HOUSE EITHER! Now wind turbines froze up for a bit, but guess what, they can be weather proofed so that shit doesn't happen ever again. They have mother fucking weather proofed wind turbines in Antarctica for fuck sakes.

[https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/](https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/)

And this is just the fucking OCEAN TOO! Guess what wind turbines can be put on also instead of water that's fucking right land too and there's plenty of that all the states have it. ^(One thing to note though wind turbines are much more efficient offshore.) Have you looked at the new CS GO MAP DE\_GRIND? THERE'S ALREADY 22 WIND TURBINES ON IT ALREADY, and believe me THEY'RE GOING TO ADD MORE! I CALL VALVE EVERY SINGLE DAMN DAY REQUESTING MORE TURBINES. That has to be a sign right? RIGHT?

And this is only in the fucking US, THERE'S OTHER FUCKING PLACES ALSO GE just partnered with Toshiba. 10 GW OF power buy 2030 1Gw each year in japan! THAT'S A FUCKING TON OF WIND TURBINES, holy shit. Toshiba is going to put a windmill in every single fucking Japan.

You know WSB doesn't give a shit about GE, I get it that's fine they didn't give a shit about GME in the beginning either with strong hard DD from DFV. Is this going to moon? No, but its going to have a sweet sweet dividend soon and a nice gradual increase for the years with other boomers flocking to it, yes. I know your portfolio is maybe 3-5% GE but I am going to need you to drain everything you have and make it 100% maybe even 130% GE why? I don't know I have a raging hard clue about this, I talked to you in my dreams. Did you have the same dream too? Ya, that's what I thought, we can both smell it blowing in the wind.!<

And there's so so so much other fucking cool ass shit that GE does, these bitches can make a train did you fucking know that? How bout all the medical tech stuff? They just released a new portable baby scanner.

LOADS OF DEBT being paid off.

Harry Markopolos the guy that caught Bernie Madoff says there's a bunch of fraud. So you know you are really gambling when you buy this stock if he says so. Nobody is trying to squeeze this. If you're a Tesla fanboy this stock probably isn't for you. Tesla and Edison hated each other, does this matter? Probably not, but it makes you wonder.

$8 Billion FREE FLOAT, not all that good BUT I AM USING CAPS, SO GET EXCITED!

$13 something is current price per share ---> 13 is a LUCKY NUMBER.

BILL GATES SAYS %80 wind/solar by 2040 or some shit like that in his book, believe me I read it

Bill Gates also READ Jeff Immelt book believe me I read it on reddit that he read it! he said so himself.

Jeff Immelt also has a tattoo of a fucking meatball on his hip. (previous CEO) Does this matter? Fuck ya it does meatballs are fucking awesome.

If you guys TRULY love risky plays THIS IS FUCKING IT! I don't know if money is going to start coming out of tech and into value, but if it were going to happen, I'd put my money that its going to happen sooner than later.

Every mother fucking state is going to have windmills, 

Once this ball starts to REALLY ROLL its going to ROLL, ROLL straight up that fucking hill and it won't stop, until its down the next hill then ROLLING up the next one then itll roll straight up fucking up MT EVEREST!!!

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

&nbsp;

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing)

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, and checking out my socials, it would mean a lot to me! **Happy Trading Everybody! :)**",ne1fla,"Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation (Week 5) - $HD, $WMT, $TGT, $LOW, $CSCO, $GOEV, $XL, $SE and More"

WIND TURBINES these things are so fucking optimized, have you seen the Haliade-x 14Mw of Power. Have you been looking at the news, look in Biden's eyes you can practically see the propeller turning, he just approved of the first farm. These bitches are going to be popping up everywhere offshore. There's already 17 wind farms being planned in the Atlantic ocean. 1,500 Wind turbines.

You might be like kek I thought they wanted to preserve their coast line or some shit. FUCK NO! They're flippy floppy as fuck and power hungry this is going to happen whether you believe it or not. You don't think GAY PEOPLE are going to want wind turbines? If there's one thing I know about gay people its they love things that twirl, believe me I loved watching these things in the pass twirl as a kid, and my mom would call me a faggot all the time.

And this is just the fucking OCEAN TOO!

Have you looked at the new CS GO MAP DE\_GRIND? THERE'S ALREADY 22 WIND TURBINES ON IT ALREADY, and believe me THEY'RE GOING TO ADD MORE! I CALL VALVE EVERY SINGLE DAMN DAY REQUESTING MORE TURBINES. That has to be a sign right? RIGHT?

No, but its going to have a sweet sweet dividend soon and a nice gradual increase for the years with other boomers flocking to it, yes.

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

&nbsp;

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

&nbsp;

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, and checking out my socials, it would mean a lot to me! **Happy Trading Everybody! :)**",ne1fla,"Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation (Week 5) - $HD, $WMT, $TGT, $LOW, $CSCO, $GOEV, $XL, $SE and More"

[**Anders Bylund**](https://boards.fool.com/profile/TMFZahrim/info.aspx) **(Nokia):** Few tech stocks have weathered the recent market storm quite like Finnish telecom infrastructure veteran Nokia. The stock has gained 32% since the New Year, including a 14% jump over the last 30 days. By contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is trading flat in 2021 and fell 7% in the last month.

This stock may feel like a joke due to the recent influx of Nokia interest from the Reddit-based WallStreetBets group, but that's just a coincidence. Nokia's real-world business prospects are solid and the stock is actually undervalued, even though it dodged the tech-stock market correction in recent months.

Nokia's solid market position was built on a foundation of [5G network](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) installations. Top-line sales are rising faster than expected, Nokia's profit margin is expanding as we speak thanks to the richer product mix, and the stock is changing hands for less than eight times free cash flow. You don't see that combination of deep-discount stock prices and robust business trends very often, and that makes Nokia a no-brainer buy right now.",ne3k42,Nokia an industry leader in the bargain bin

**SPY 6/18 $320** calls are at the last price of **96.02** which gives us a total value of:

So what are we good for?

Forced labor?    No way.    1 doing what?   2 they got robots.  3.  We kinda suck.   Were fragile and complain a lot.

Resources... nope.   Matter to energy... they don't need gold or oil.   They flew here.   They got resources pretty much figured out.

Food?   Nope.   The food we eat doesn't make us healthy... I doubt they would wanna eat us.


Whats the one thing every body who gets abducted says?    Butt stuff. Or maybe they call it probing to keep some dignity,  but we all know it's butt stuff.  That's all we're good for.   Picture some hill billies sticking a fire cracker in a frogs butt.   Now make that hill Billy shorter.. with big eyes and grey.     Lose the pick up truck and add a space ships. We are the frogs..

3D PRINTED AIRPLANE ENGINES this is some futuristic next tech tree shit you only see in Starcraft. Is Ge going to be the first to make a battle cruiser? I don't fucking know, are there going to be Zerg, possibly who the fuck knows in this simulation. You think they're going to just stop there and this brings me to my next point. Air travel is going to start to recover bigly soon.

WIND TURBINES these things are so fucking optimized, have you seen the Haliade-x 14Mw of Power. Have you been looking at the news, look in Biden's eyes you can practically see the propeller turning, he just approved of the first farm. These bitches are going to be popping up everywhere offshore. There's already 17 wind farms being planned in the Atlantic ocean. 1,500 Wind turbines.

And THATS JUST THE ATLANTIC OCEAN, WHAT ABOUT THE fucking LIBTARD PACIFIC OCEAN? You don't think mother fucking California isn't going to want FUCKING WIND TURBINE ACTION? You might be like kek I thought they wanted to preserve their coast line or some shit. FUCK NO! They're flippy floppy as fuck and power hungry this is going to happen whether you believe it or not. You don't think GAY PEOPLE are going to want wind turbines? If there's one thing I know about gay people its they love things that twirl, believe me I loved watching these things in the pass twirl as a kid, and my mom would call me a faggot all the time. I REFUSE TO APOLOGIZE FOR THIS!

Guess what fucking state is BETTER THAN CALIFORNIA in wind? MOTHER FUCKING BIG ASS TEXAS, the biggest mother fucking state to ever fucking live, 20% of their energy comes from wind ALREADY, what the fuck are you libtards doing?! TEXAS ALREADY LEAVING YOU IN THE DUST. I broke rule 5, what are you going to do about it, not going to wear a mask in my OWN HOUSE EITHER! Now wind turbines froze up for a bit, but guess what, they can be weather proofed so that shit doesn't happen ever again. They have mother fucking weather proofed wind turbines in Antarctica for fuck sakes.

And this is just the fucking OCEAN TOO! Guess what wind turbines can be put on also instead of water that's fucking right land too and there's plenty of that all the states have it. ^(One thing to note though wind turbines are much more efficient offshore.) Have you looked at the new CS GO MAP DE\_GRIND? THERE'S ALREADY 22 WIND TURBINES ON IT ALREADY, and believe me THEY'RE GOING TO ADD MORE! I CALL VALVE EVERY SINGLE DAMN DAY REQUESTING MORE TURBINES. That has to be a sign right? RIGHT?

And this is only in the fucking US, THERE'S OTHER FUCKING PLACES ALSO GE just partnered with Toshiba. 10 GW OF power buy 2030 1Gw each year in japan! THAT'S A FUCKING TON OF WIND TURBINES, holy shit. Toshiba is going to put a windmill in every single fucking Japan.

Harry Markopolos the guy that caught Bernie Madoff says there's a bunch of fraud. So you know you are really gambling when you buy this stock if he says so. Nobody is trying to squeeze this.

Jeff Immelt also has a tattoo of a fucking meatball on his hip. (previous CEO) Does this matter? Fuck ya it does meatballs are fucking awesome.

If you guys TRULY love risky plays THIS IS FUCKING IT! I don't know if money is going to start coming out of tech and into value, but if it were going to happen, I'd put my money that its going to happen sooner than later.

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

&nbsp;

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

&nbsp;

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, and checking out my socials, it would mean a lot to me! **Happy Trading Everybody! :)**",ne1fla,"Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation (Week 5) - $HD, $WMT, $TGT, $LOW, $CSCO, $GOEV, $XL, $SE and More"

[**Anders Bylund**](https://boards.fool.com/profile/TMFZahrim/info.aspx) **(Nokia):** Few tech stocks have weathered the recent market storm quite like Finnish telecom infrastructure veteran Nokia. The stock has gained 32% since the New Year, including a 14% jump over the last 30 days. By contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is trading flat in 2021 and fell 7% in the last month.

This stock may feel like a joke due to the recent influx of Nokia interest from the Reddit-based WallStreetBets group, but that's just a coincidence. Nokia's real-world business prospects are solid and the stock is actually undervalued, even though it dodged the tech-stock market correction in recent months.

Nokia's solid market position was built on a foundation of [5G network](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) installations. Top-line sales are rising faster than expected, Nokia's profit margin is expanding as we speak thanks to the richer product mix, and the stock is changing hands for less than eight times free cash flow. You don't see that combination of deep-discount stock prices and robust business trends very often, and that makes Nokia a no-brainer buy right now.",ne3k42,Nokia an industry leader in the bargain bin

Home Depot reports earnings premarket 5/18. HD has beat earnings consistently and the share price has reacted negatively each time. In this market I feel like the play here is a strangle. My proposed play is the closest to the money strikes. Right now based on $324 list that would be the 5/21 323.5P/325C. You are in for about $1k. Break even is 3% in either direction. Of course we are hoping for 6% at least.

November earnings was a beat and the stock dropped 6% that day. That would be 100% profit with the trade I propose for educational purposes only. The previous report had a -3.2% drop that day which would still print.

Here is the kicker. The 5 day high is $344 (5/10) and low $317 (5/12) for a 2 day swing of 8.4% bases on Friday close. This is key because it means there is the potential for both sides of the strangle to be profitable prior to expiration! Nuts right?

Here is how to play it. Watch the housing report tomorrow (5/17). With lumber prices being insane new construction might be a miss. If HD stock goes down you will need to consider if the market will price this in when digesting an earnings miss. You will want to wait until the end of the day to enter the strangle to make sure you have strikes that put the Monday close in the middle.

If earnings are a beat and the prices goes up >3% sell the call once you are happy with the profit. Lock in your tuition money because again, this is for education. Same goes for the inverse. Then you have until Friday to try to get tendies with the other side. Can't remember the Vince Vaughn line from Dodge ball but it think it's ""that's what we call the jackpot"".

Not WSB material you say? Earnings plays are inherently gambling and sir, this is a casino.

Positions: none yet. Ask me at 3PM tomorrow you illiterate ape.

TLDR: Home Depot is usually located in  very close proximity to a Wendy's = tendies.

Friday, I decided to load up on 1-2 week out OTM calls (at strikes probably around 10%-30% above the current market value). I‚Äôll be throwing a couple grand a week at this trade til it hits! 

MGM, NCLH, BA, BP are my picks. Each from a different industry, positively impacted by the reopening and ensuing pent-up demand of the economy. I‚Äôm swinging for the MIL on this! 

I‚Äôm a bull here for technical reasons. However, the fundamentals make sense here now as well. The current bull-market trendlines on all the reopen stonks started with a vaccine announcement on November 9th in the early A.M.

The CDC letting ‚Äúvaccinated‚Äù people stop social distancing has majorly positive implications for the economy. Think of traveling, think of the impeding Memorial Day weekend...

Go check out the 1-year, 1-day charts for these stocks, and draw a line from the close on November 6th to now. I think we see 30% or more gains in the value of these stocks the next couple weeks.

I think you are focusing on the wrong areas, as no one buys a Tesla thinking the build quality is good. Also I would argue that catching up with build quality is exponentially easier than catching up with software, have you seen and modern car software? They‚Äôre terrible, bmw was still using CD and lacked Bluetooth in 2010. Traditional automakers are very behind when it comes to cutting edge tech(software wise)",,

That guy has a red bandana and the proven gift to make people millionaires, I prefer black bandanas plus he has a degree, or some shit I don't, wish I did, but I don't, yet and that's reality. Look I am going to level with you, I play fast and loose. I don't go with the trends. I am a complete outsider and a rebel. I am heavy long on GE. Do I know what I am talking about?

ADDITIVE EVERYTHING

3D PRINTED AIRPLANE ENGINES this is some futuristic next tech tree shit you only see in Starcraft. Is Ge going to be the first to make a battle cruiser? I don't fucking know, are there going to be Zerg, possibly who the fuck knows in this simulation. You think they're going to just stop there and this brings me to my next point. Air travel is going to start to recover bigly soon.

Renewables

WIND TURBINES these things are so fucking optimized, have you seen the Haliade-x 14Mw of Power. Have you been looking at the news, look in Biden's eyes you can practically see the propeller turning, he just approved of the first farm. These bitches are going to be popping up everywhere offshore. There's already 17 wind farms being planned in the Atlantic ocean. 1,500 Wind turbines.

And THATS JUST THE ATLANTIC OCEAN, WHAT ABOUT THE fucking LIBTARD PACIFIC OCEAN? You don't think mother fucking California isn't going to want FUCKING WIND TURBINE ACTION? You might be like kek I thought they wanted to preserve their coast line or some shit. FUCK NO! They're flippy floppy as fuck and power hungry this is going to happen whether you believe it or not. You don't think GAY PEOPLE are going to want wind turbines? If there's one thing I know about gay people its they love things that twirl, believe me I loved watching these things in the pass twirl as a kid, and my mom would call me a faggot all the time. I REFUSE TO APOLOGIZE FOR THIS!

Guess what fucking state is BETTER THAN CALIFORNIA in wind? MOTHER FUCKING BIG ASS TEXAS, the biggest mother fucking state to ever fucking live, 20% of their energy comes from wind ALREADY, what the fuck are you libtards doing?! TEXAS ALREADY LEAVING YOU IN THE DUST. I broke rule 5, what are you going to do about it, not going to wear a mask in my OWN HOUSE EITHER! Now wind turbines froze up for a bit, but guess what, they can be weather proofed so that shit doesn't happen ever again. They have mother fucking weather proofed wind turbines in Antarctica for fuck sakes.

[https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/](https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/)

And this is just the fucking OCEAN TOO! Guess what wind turbines can be put on also instead of water that's fucking right land too and there's plenty of that all the states have it. ^(One thing to note though wind turbines are much more efficient offshore.) Have you looked at the new CS GO MAP DE\_GRIND? THERE'S ALREADY 22 WIND TURBINES ON IT ALREADY, and believe me THEY'RE GOING TO ADD MORE! I CALL VALVE EVERY SINGLE DAMN DAY REQUESTING MORE TURBINES. That has to be a sign right? RIGHT?

And this is only in the fucking US, THERE'S OTHER FUCKING PLACES ALSO GE just partnered with Toshiba. 10 GW OF power buy 2030 1Gw each year in japan! THAT'S A FUCKING TON OF WIND TURBINES, holy shit. Toshiba is going to put a windmill in every single fucking Japan.

>!Look Jim this part is for you, for your eyes only nobody else read I swear to fuck. I am going to need you to go and drain your bank account and put every single last red cent into GE, I feel it, you feel it. You know WSB doesn't give a shit about GE, I get it that's fine they didn't give a shit about GME in the beginning either with strong hard DD from DFV. Is this going to moon? No, but its going to have a sweet sweet dividend soon and a nice gradual increase for the years with other boomers flocking to it, yes. I know your portfolio is maybe 3-5% GE but I am going to need you to drain everything you have and make it 100% maybe even 130% GE why? I don't know I have a raging hard clue about this, I talked to you in my dreams. Did you have the same dream too? Ya, that's what I thought, we can both smell it blowing in the wind.!<

And there's so so so much other fucking cool ass shit that GE does, these bitches can make a train did you fucking know that? How bout all the medical tech stuff? They just released a new portable baby scanner.

LOADS OF DEBT being paid off.

Harry Markopolos the guy that caught Bernie Madoff says there's a bunch of fraud. So you know you are really gambling when you buy this stock if he says so. Nobody is trying to squeeze this. If you're a Tesla fanboy this stock probably isn't for you. Tesla and Edison hated each other, does this matter? Probably not, but it makes you wonder.

$8 Billion FREE FLOAT, not all that good BUT I AM USING CAPS, SO GET EXCITED!

$13 something is current price per share ---> 13 is a LUCKY NUMBER.

BILL GATES SAYS %80 wind/solar by 2040 or some shit like that in his book, believe me I read it

Bill Gates also READ Jeff Immelt book believe me I read it on reddit that he read it! he said so himself.

Jeff Immelt also has a tattoo of a fucking meatball on his hip. (previous CEO) Does this matter? Fuck ya it does meatballs are fucking awesome.

If you guys TRULY love risky plays THIS IS FUCKING IT! I don't know if money is going to start coming out of tech and into value, but if it were going to happen, I'd put my money that its going to happen sooner than later.

Every mother fucking state is going to have windmills, 

Once this ball starts to REALLY ROLL its going to ROLL, ROLL straight up that fucking hill and it won't stop, until its down the next hill then ROLLING up the next one then itll roll straight up fucking up MT EVEREST!!!

I AM WAVING THE FUCKING AMERICAN GOD DAMN FLAG RIGHT NOW ALERTING all of you like PAUL f'ing REVERE. 

If you hate the thought of America creating more job then don't buy.

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

&nbsp;

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

&nbsp;

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, and checking out my socials, it would mean a lot to me! **Happy Trading Everybody! :)**",ne1fla,"Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation (Week 5) - $HD, $WMT, $TGT, $LOW, $CSCO, $GOEV, $XL, $SE and More"

[**Anders Bylund**](https://boards.fool.com/profile/TMFZahrim/info.aspx) **(Nokia):** Few tech stocks have weathered the recent market storm quite like Finnish telecom infrastructure veteran Nokia. The stock has gained 32% since the New Year, including a 14% jump over the last 30 days. By contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is trading flat in 2021 and fell 7% in the last month.

This stock may feel like a joke due to the recent influx of Nokia interest from the Reddit-based WallStreetBets group, but that's just a coincidence. Nokia's real-world business prospects are solid and the stock is actually undervalued, even though it dodged the tech-stock market correction in recent months.

Nokia's solid market position was built on a foundation of [5G network](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) installations. Top-line sales are rising faster than expected, Nokia's profit margin is expanding as we speak thanks to the richer product mix, and the stock is changing hands for less than eight times free cash flow. You don't see that combination of deep-discount stock prices and robust business trends very often, and that makes Nokia a no-brainer buy right now.",ne3k42,Nokia an industry leader in the bargain bin

Home Depot reports earnings premarket 5/18. HD has beat earnings consistently and the share price has reacted negatively each time. In this market I feel like the play here is a strangle. My proposed play is the closest to the money strikes. Right now based on $324 list that would be the 5/21 323.5P/325C. You are in for about $1k. Break even is 3% in either direction. Of course we are hoping for 6% at least.

November earnings was a beat and the stock dropped 6% that day. That would be 100% profit with the trade I propose for educational purposes only. The previous report had a -3.2% drop that day which would still print.

Here is the kicker. The 5 day high is $344 (5/10) and low $317 (5/12) for a 2 day swing of 8.4% bases on Friday close. This is key because it means there is the potential for both sides of the strangle to be profitable prior to expiration! Nuts right?

Here is how to play it. Watch the housing report tomorrow (5/17). With lumber prices being insane new construction might be a miss. If HD stock goes down you will need to consider if the market will price this in when digesting an earnings miss. You will want to wait until the end of the day to enter the strangle to make sure you have strikes that put the Monday close in the middle.

If earnings are a beat and the prices goes up >3% sell the call once you are happy with the profit. Lock in your tuition money because again, this is for education. Same goes for the inverse. Then you have until Friday to try to get tendies with the other side. Can't remember the Vince Vaughn line from Dodge ball but it think it's ""that's what we call the jackpot"".

Not WSB material you say? Earnings plays are inherently gambling and sir, this is a casino.

Positions: none yet. Ask me at 3PM tomorrow you illiterate ape.

TLDR: Home Depot is usually located in  very close proximity to a Wendy's = tendies.

Friday, I decided to load up on 1-2 week out OTM calls (at strikes probably around 10%-30% above the current market value). I‚Äôll be throwing a couple grand a week at this trade til it hits! 

MGM, NCLH, BA, BP are my picks. Each from a different industry, positively impacted by the reopening and ensuing pent-up demand of the economy. I‚Äôm swinging for the MIL on this! 

I‚Äôm a bull here for technical reasons. However, the fundamentals make sense here now as well. The current bull-market trendlines on all the reopen stonks started with a vaccine announcement on November 9th in the early A.M. (the freaking insiders bought/drove up prices before the market opened, that sucked).

The CDC letting ‚Äúvaccinated‚Äù people stop social distancing has majorly positive implications for the economy. Think of traveling, think of the impeding Memorial Day weekend...

Go check out the 1-year, 1-day charts for these stocks, and draw a line from the close on November 6th to now. I think we see 30% or more gains in the value of these stocks the next couple weeks.

I  have shared my thoughts on UWMC in past. The company announced Q1  earnings and while they look like they are below expectations it was  explained by the CEO that because of the speed of their execution, their  results are reflective of the higher rate environment already while  competitors are lagged.

During    the Q4 2020 earnings call he  had mused about options that would be on    the stable, special dividend,  buyback or raising the dividend.

**Feb Q4 Earnings Quote:**

The     Board did approve a dividend, a $0.10 quarterly dividend to be  paid    on  April 6 for all shareholders of record as of March 10. **We expect  this to be a regular quarterly dividend**.

And     so you guys know how we're thinking about this. Our balance sheet   is  a   fortress. And our current liquidity position is very strong, and    we   have access to the capital markets as well. The way we think  about   this   going forward is we're producing a lot of cash. We're  going to   maybe   be more profitable than some expected and be very  successful in   2021.   And **if we have excess cash that I and the Board deem is too much,  we will be delivering that back**. And whether we have to **change     the  dividend in the future, as in raise it or a special dividend,     those  things are definitely on the table or even buying back shares**.

**May Q1 Earnings Quote:**

As     you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of      $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a      record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I always  **explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special  dividend or a share buyback program**. As you guys have seen, we **concluded      share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward   shareholders.    We announced the authorization of $300 million share   buyback over the    next 24 months**.  And **quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that**.

**Then in answering a question from an analyst**

Doug    Harter -  Great. And then just in terms of capital return, you    mentioned sort of  the float. I  guess just how are you thinking about    kind of **how much of  the float  you'd be willing to take out and pacing around share  repurchase**?

Mat Ishbia -  Yes, Doug. So I'm learning these rules as we go **because at this stock  price, I'm a buyer, right**?    And so we'll buy shares as soon as tomorrow, I  think, as our legal    teams say we're allowed to do. And so I don't know  how many I can buy    and what I can do, but I'm very conscientious of the  float.  If the    float was not a concern, **we'd be more aggressive**. However,  **we     have authorization from the Board to buy up to $300 million, and I'm      going to take advantage of that opportunity while being  conscientious     of our partners in the float.**

TL/DR:     UWMC and their board have been looking at ways to give back to     shareholders. Instead of a short term cash out, they decided on a     buyback that they are planning to exercise immediately on so that they     can retire shares while the SP is low. They will NOT buy so much that   it   will ruin their float % for Russell. The CEO is aggressive, has    approval to spend $300 and he's going to take FULL advantage.  The CEO has stated he is a BUYER! They are  not   waiting, it's being deployed now.

Disclosure I am still in long position with 25K  at 8.39 USD shares of UWMC

3D PRINTED AIRPLANE ENGINES this is some futuristic next tech tree shit you only see in Starcraft. Is Ge going to be the first to make a battle cruiser? I don't fucking know, are there going to be Zerg, possibly who the fuck knows in this simulation. You think they're going to just stop there and this brings me to my next point. Air travel is going to start to recover bigly soon.

Renewables

WIND TURBINES these things are so fucking optimized, have you seen the Haliade-x 14Mw of Power. Have you been looking at the news, look in Biden's eyes you can practically see the propeller turning, he just approved of the first farm. These bitches are going to be popping up everywhere offshore. There's already 17 wind farms being planned in the Atlantic ocean. 1,500 Wind turbines.

And THATS JUST THE ATLANTIC OCEAN, WHAT ABOUT THE fucking LIBTARD PACIFIC OCEAN? You don't think mother fucking California isn't going to want FUCKING WIND TURBINE ACTION? You might be like kek I thought they wanted to preserve their coast line or some shit. FUCK NO! They're flippy floppy as fuck and power hungry this is going to happen whether you believe it or not. You don't think GAY PEOPLE are going to want wind turbines? If there's one thing I know about gay people its they love things that twirl, believe me I loved watching these things in the pass twirl as a kid, and my mom would call me a faggot all the time. I REFUSE TO APOLOGIZE FOR THIS!

MOTHER FUCKING BIG ASS TEXAS, the biggest mother fucking state to ever fucking live, 20% of their energy comes from wind ALREADY, what the fuck are you libtards doing?! TEXAS ALREADY LEAVING YOU IN THE DUST. I broke rule 5, what are you going to do about it, not going to wear a mask in my OWN HOUSE EITHER! Now wind turbines froze up for a bit, but guess what, they can be weather proofed so that shit doesn't happen ever again. They have mother fucking weather proofed wind turbines in Antarctica for fuck sakes.

[https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/](https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/)

And this is just the fucking OCEAN TOO! Guess what wind turbines can be put on also instead of water that's fucking right land too and there's plenty of that all the states have it. ^(One thing to note though wind turbines are much more efficient offshore.) Have you looked at the new CS GO MAP DE\_GRIND? THERE'S ALREADY 22 WIND TURBINES ON IT ALREADY, and believe me THEY'RE GOING TO ADD MORE! I CALL VALVE EVERY SINGLE DAMN DAY REQUESTING MORE TURBINES. That has to be a sign right? RIGHT?

And this is only in the fucking US, THERE'S OTHER FUCKING PLACES ALSO GE just partnered with Toshiba. 10 GW OF power buy 2030 1Gw each year in japan! THAT'S A FUCKING TON OF WIND TURBINES, holy shit. Toshiba is going to put a windmill in every single fucking Japan.

You know WSB doesn't give a shit about GE, I get it that's fine they didn't give a shit about GME in the beginning either with strong hard DD from DFV. Is this going to moon? No, but its going to have a sweet sweet dividend soon and a nice gradual increase for the years with other boomers flocking to it, yes. I know your portfolio is maybe 3-5% GE but I am going to need you to drain everything you have and make it 100% maybe even 130% GE why? I don't know I have a raging hard clue about this, I talked to you in my dreams. Did you have the same dream too? Ya, that's what I thought, we can both smell it blowing in the wind.!<

LOADS OF DEBT being paid off.

Harry Markopolos the guy that caught Bernie Madoff says there's a bunch of fraud. So you know you are really gambling when you buy this stock if he says so. Nobody is trying to squeeze this.

$8 Billion FREE FLOAT, not all that good BUT I AM USING CAPS, SO GET EXCITED!

$13 something is current price per share ---> 13 is a LUCKY NUMBER.

BILL GATES SAYS %80 wind/solar by 2040 or some shit like that in his book, believe me I read it

Bill Gates also READ Jeff Immelt book believe me I read it on reddit that he read it! he said so himself.

Jeff Immelt also has a tattoo of a fucking meatball on his hip. (previous CEO) Does this matter? Fuck ya it does meatballs are fucking awesome.

If you guys TRULY love risky plays THIS IS FUCKING IT! I don't know if money is going to start coming out of tech and into value, but if it were going to happen, I'd put my money that its going to happen sooner than later.

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

&nbsp;

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

&nbsp;

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, and checking out my socials, it would mean a lot to me! **Happy Trading Everybody! :)**",ne1fla,"Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation (Week 5) - $HD, $WMT, $TGT, $LOW, $CSCO, $GOEV, $XL, $SE and More"

[**Anders Bylund**](https://boards.fool.com/profile/TMFZahrim/info.aspx) **(Nokia):** Few tech stocks have weathered the recent market storm quite like Finnish telecom infrastructure veteran Nokia. The stock has gained 32% since the New Year, including a 14% jump over the last 30 days. By contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is trading flat in 2021 and fell 7% in the last month.

This stock may feel like a joke due to the recent influx of Nokia interest from the Reddit-based WallStreetBets group, but that's just a coincidence. Nokia's real-world business prospects are solid and the stock is actually undervalued, even though it dodged the tech-stock market correction in recent months.

Nokia's solid market position was built on a foundation of [5G network](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) installations. Top-line sales are rising faster than expected, Nokia's profit margin is expanding as we speak thanks to the richer product mix, and the stock is changing hands for less than eight times free cash flow. You don't see that combination of deep-discount stock prices and robust business trends very often, and that makes Nokia a no-brainer buy right now.",ne3k42,Nokia an industry leader in the bargain bin

Home Depot reports earnings premarket 5/18. HD has beat earnings consistently and the share price has reacted negatively each time. In this market I feel like the play here is a strangle. My proposed play is the closest to the money strikes. Right now based on $324 list that would be the 5/21 323.5P/325C. You are in for about $1k. Break even is 3% in either direction. Of course we are hoping for 6% at least.

November earnings was a beat and the stock dropped 6% that day. That would be 100% profit with the trade I propose for educational purposes only. The previous report had a -3.2% drop that day which would still print.

Here is the kicker. The 5 day high is $344 (5/10) and low $317 (5/12) for a 2 day swing of 8.4% bases on Friday close. This is key because it means there is the potential for both sides of the strangle to be profitable prior to expiration! Nuts right?

Here is how to play it. Watch the housing report tomorrow (5/17). With lumber prices being insane new construction might be a miss. If HD stock goes down you will need to consider if the market will price this in when digesting an earnings miss. You will want to wait until the end of the day to enter the strangle to make sure you have strikes that put the Monday close in the middle.

If earnings are a beat and the prices goes up >3% sell the call once you are happy with the profit. Lock in your tuition money because again, this is for education. Same goes for the inverse. Then you have until Friday to try to get tendies with the other side. Can't remember the Vince Vaughn line from Dodge ball but it think it's ""that's what we call the jackpot"".

Not WSB material you say? Earnings plays are inherently gambling and sir, this is a casino.

Positions: none yet. Ask me at 3PM tomorrow you illiterate ape.

TLDR: Home Depot is usually located in  very close proximity to a Wendy's = tendies.

Friday, I decided to load up on 1-2 week out OTM calls (at strikes probably around 10%-30% above the current market value). I‚Äôll be throwing a couple grand a week at this trade til it hits! 

MGM, NCLH, BA, BP are my picks. Each from a different industry, positively impacted by the reopening and ensuing pent-up demand of the economy. I‚Äôm swinging for the MIL on this! 

I‚Äôm a bull here for technical reasons. However, the fundamentals make sense here now as well. The current bull-market trendlines on all the reopen stonks started with a vaccine announcement on November 9th in the early A.M. (the freaking insiders bought/drove up prices before the market opened, that sucked).

The CDC letting ‚Äúvaccinated‚Äù people stop social distancing has majorly positive implications for the economy. Think of traveling, think of the impeding Memorial Day weekend...

Go check out the 1-year, 1-day charts for these stocks, and draw a line from the close on November 6th to now. I think we see 30% or more gains in the value of these stocks the next couple weeks.

Now it becomes 1300 after adding healthcare/vision/dental. And afterwards, it becomes 1100 after he matches his employers 401k. So in total, let's just say he makes 4400 a month.

Since he's probably 31 or something, let's assume he doesn't live with his parents, let's just say he lives in a cheap run down studio apartment for about 1400 a month. Then we got food - 400, gas - 160, electric - 130, internet - 50, cell phone - 50, insurance - 120. We also need to include miscellaneous stuff that he will need such as toilet paper, soap, beer, and etc - 200. This leaves with him with 1890 a month.

So in 1 year, he can save 22,680. His student loan is 400k, he will not save anything. He's not living. He's surviving. This man will probably be 50 years old before he finally pays off his student loan. He only knows the frugal way to live.

Now let's assume he lives with his parents instead. The only difference will be, all the money he is saving will be for a down payment for a house. That's all. He will then have a mortgage and a giant student loan. I weep for his situation.",,

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, and checking out my socials, it would mean a lot to me! **Happy Trading Everybody! :)**",ne1fla,"Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation (Week 5) - $HD, $WMT, $TGT, $LOW, $CSCO, $GOEV, $XL, $SE and More"

[**Anders Bylund**](https://boards.fool.com/profile/TMFZahrim/info.aspx) **(Nokia):** Few tech stocks have weathered the recent market storm quite like Finnish telecom infrastructure veteran Nokia. The stock has gained 32% since the New Year, including a 14% jump over the last 30 days. By contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is trading flat in 2021 and fell 7% in the last month.

This stock may feel like a joke due to the recent influx of Nokia interest from the Reddit-based WallStreetBets group, but that's just a coincidence. Nokia's real-world business prospects are solid and the stock is actually undervalued, even though it dodged the tech-stock market correction in recent months.

Nokia's solid market position was built on a foundation of [5G network](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) installations. Top-line sales are rising faster than expected, Nokia's profit margin is expanding as we speak thanks to the richer product mix, and the stock is changing hands for less than eight times free cash flow. You don't see that combination of deep-discount stock prices and robust business trends very often, and that makes Nokia a no-brainer buy right now.",ne3k42,Nokia an industry leader in the bargain bin

Home Depot reports earnings premarket 5/18. HD has beat earnings consistently and the share price has reacted negatively each time. In this market I feel like the play here is a strangle. My proposed play is the closest to the money strikes. Right now based on $324 list that would be the 5/21 323.5P/325C. You are in for about $1k. Break even is 3% in either direction. Of course we are hoping for 6% at least.

November earnings was a beat and the stock dropped 6% that day. That would be 100% profit with the trade I propose for educational purposes only. The previous report had a -3.2% drop that day which would still print.

Here is the kicker. The 5 day high is $344 (5/10) and low $317 (5/12) for a 2 day swing of 8.4% bases on Friday close. This is key because it means there is the potential for both sides of the strangle to be profitable prior to expiration! Nuts right?

Here is how to play it. Watch the housing report tomorrow (5/17). With lumber prices being insane new construction might be a miss. If HD stock goes down you will need to consider if the market will price this in when digesting an earnings miss. You will want to wait until the end of the day to enter the strangle to make sure you have strikes that put the Monday close in the middle.

If earnings are a beat and the prices goes up >3% sell the call once you are happy with the profit. Lock in your tuition money because again, this is for education. Same goes for the inverse. Then you have until Friday to try to get tendies with the other side. Can't remember the Vince Vaughn line from Dodge ball but it think it's ""that's what we call the jackpot"".

Not WSB material you say? Earnings plays are inherently gambling and sir, this is a casino.

Positions: none yet. Ask me at 3PM tomorrow you illiterate ape.

TLDR: Home Depot is usually located in  very close proximity to a Wendy's = tendies.

MGM, NCLH, BA, BP are my picks. Each from a different industry, positively impacted by the reopening and ensuing pent-up demand of the economy. I‚Äôm swinging for the MIL on this! 

I‚Äôm a bull here for technical reasons. However, the fundamentals make sense here now as well. The current bull-market trendlines on all the reopen stonks started with a vaccine announcement on November 9th in the early A.M. (the freaking insiders bought/drove up prices before the market opened, that sucked).

The CDC letting ‚Äúvaccinated‚Äù people stop social distancing has majorly positive implications for the economy. Think of traveling, think of the impeding Memorial Day weekend...

Go check out the 1-year, 1-day charts for these stocks, and draw a line from the close on November 6th to now. I think we see 30% or more gains in the value of these stocks the next couple weeks.

I  have shared my thoughts on UWMC in past. The company announced Q1  earnings and while they look like they are below expectations it was  explained by the CEO that because of the speed of their execution, their  results are reflective of the higher rate environment already while  competitors are lagged.

During    the Q4 2020 earnings call he  had mused about options that would be on    the stable, special dividend,  buyback or raising the dividend.

**Feb Q4 Earnings Quote:**

The     Board did approve a dividend, a $0.10 quarterly dividend to be  paid    on  April 6 for all shareholders of record as of March 10. **We expect  this to be a regular quarterly dividend**.

And     so you guys know how we're thinking about this. Our balance sheet   is  a   fortress. And our current liquidity position is very strong, and    we   have access to the capital markets as well. The way we think  about   this   going forward is we're producing a lot of cash. We're  going to   maybe   be more profitable than some expected and be very  successful in   2021.   And **if we have excess cash that I and the Board deem is too much,  we will be delivering that back**. And whether we have to **change     the  dividend in the future, as in raise it or a special dividend,     those  things are definitely on the table or even buying back shares**.

**May Q1 Earnings Quote:**

As     you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of      $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a      record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I always  **explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special  dividend or a share buyback program**. As you guys have seen, we **concluded      share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward   shareholders.    We announced the authorization of $300 million share   buyback over the    next 24 months**.  And **quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that**.

**Then in answering a question from an analyst**

Doug    Harter -  Great. And then just in terms of capital return, you    mentioned sort of  the float. I  guess just how are you thinking about    kind of **how much of  the float  you'd be willing to take out and pacing around share  repurchase**?

Mat Ishbia -  Yes, Doug. So I'm learning these rules as we go **because at this stock  price, I'm a buyer, right**?    And so we'll buy shares as soon as tomorrow, I  think, as our legal    teams say we're allowed to do. And so I don't know  how many I can buy    and what I can do, but I'm very conscientious of the  float.  If the    float was not a concern, **we'd be more aggressive**. However,  **we     have authorization from the Board to buy up to $300 million, and I'm      going to take advantage of that opportunity while being  conscientious     of our partners in the float.**

TL/DR:     UWMC and their board have been looking at ways to give back to     shareholders. Instead of a short term cash out, they decided on a     buyback that they are planning to exercise immediately on so that they     can retire shares while the SP is low. They will NOT buy so much that   it   will ruin their float % for Russell. The CEO is aggressive, has    approval to spend $300 and he's going to take FULL advantage.  The CEO has stated he is a BUYER! They are  not   waiting, it's being deployed now.

If we can open above 6.9 (50day SMA) I think we can close around that 7.14 (200day SMA) level which should line us up for that move out of the $6-$8 range and into the $10s and beyond.

Now funny enough what actually has me the most bullish this morning is looking at Friday alone. Selling pressure was suppressed by the bulls and it closed right near HOD above all major resistances.

UWMC is ready to pop!

I was in UWMC for the value play. It is a STEAL at 10$ on fundamentals anything below that is an insane deal. Even above 10 has a strong long-term argument.

Here is UWMC in a nutshell: heavily shorted, borrow costs skyrocketing, mortgage industry hit overly hard on fears of rising interest rates, the CEO Ishiba announces a 300M stock buyback, and shorts are QUAKING. UP 6% in premarket following being up 1-2% Friday. This puts at starting at $8 Monday with $9 being a CRITICAL Friday target for us.

All UWMC needs is a little unexpected retail buying pressure and it POPS! In truth this is not just a short squeeze, its multiple plays rolled into one. We have retail buying hype train going (obviously, look at all the WSB posts here posted below), short-squeeze due to high cost of borrow, Gamma squeeze due to the MASSIVE options interest, 300M stock buyback by CEO to scare off the shorts, an unfair post-earnings plunge, plus good-ole\` company doing good things (making money).

We coming back for some of our loyal bagholders that have been holding UWMC since the last train to $14, hey guys remember to take profit this time ;)

It is now cost-prohibitive to use more shorts to keep the price low. The normal dirty tricks triple in price so become less-used. Shorts use this borrow price to determine feasibility and 93% is obviously unfeasible, THEY WILL COVER. Once one group starts covering and causes a spike, other shorts will rush to do the same.

It's a prisoner's dilemma and HF's want to cut each other's throats just as much as ours. Let's let them!!!

Many of these 7.50,9. 10, and 12 are OTM or barely ITM. and an early week spike to put 9c ITM would force MM's to hedge to delta-neutral...further pushing 10c and 12.50 c into hedge territory. This can quickly cause things to spiral out of control for shorts.

Stock BuyBack,

Ishbia is going to war with the shorts and his weapon of choice is a 300M stock buyback (similar to RKT's special dividend for the same purpose). The buyback could have started happening as early as May 11th.

Most of the float is owned by institutions and insiders so this buyback puts increased pressure of a heavily shorted (13%+) and heavily held float pool.

Retail is gorging on the float, institutions are holding the float, and Ishbia is buying the free float up. This is a recipe for ROCKET FUEL. WIth shorts paying 93%, they will stop shorting so the shares we are buying are REAL, not synthetic.

Make them buy real shares, from us, at 20$ each.

I am in UWMC for the long-term VALUE-PLAY and like the stock. I like the company., I like the CEO. I like the market position. I like the value. I ilke the stock.

I am loading up on 6/18 8c options. Options are important as we move up to force MM's to buy to remain market neutral.

Options do not pay unless we buy shares, so I suggest splitting half/half to each. options can cause MM's to balance risk and lead to large upswings but this cannot happen without buying pressure and the underlying spiking to necessitate balancing risk, which means we need to buy stocks as well.

Options are good for Gamma Squeeze/MM's balance buys (and profit) but shares are needed to keep the underlying JOOSED and keep those options deep ITM.

MIX IT UP!

This is the final call for the UWMC tendie train so get your fucking tickets and remember; Gravy costs extra,

7955,,2021-05-17 13:20:55,t3_neg3ey,,wallstreetbets,"$UWMC has become one of the most hyped stocks in the online investment community. Online activity appears to be ramping up after earnings and heading into May 21st option expiries. Since UWM is getting a lot of new eyes, it seemed like an appropriate time to share why some investors may consider UWM as a long term hold. 

UWM is a mortgage company that focuses exclusively on the broker channel. It‚Äôs the largest wholesale mortgage provider in the US and the second largest mortgage originator, behind Rocket Companies. 

It‚Äôs CEO is Mat Ishbia, who started as it‚Äôs 12th employee and who‚Äôs dad, Jeff, started the company as a side hustle. Mat and his brother own 94% of the company in Class D shares. The rest of the public float, \~100m Class A shares, are what is available for the public to purchase. 

# What trends are pushing $UWMC‚Äôs stock down? 

**The largest threat UWM is facing is raising interest rates**: 

About 75% of UWM income is related to refinance activity. The pandemic pushed rates to historic lows so most consumers were better off refinancing. Millions have done that, leading to record profit for mortgage providers like UWM and Rocket. 

**The strength of the broker channel:**

UWM is completely dependent on brokers finding business and closing loans. It doesn‚Äôt have any direct-to-consumer lending operations like Rocket does. 

**Short Interest:** 

Sophisticated investors are seeing 75% of income potentially attached to rate sensitive products (not all refi‚Äôs are rate sensitive like cash out), and are salivating. They think the market is under appreciating this headwind and shorting the stock. They have basically shorted all the shares they can. Friday the stock ended with 200 shares available and an insane 93% borrow rate. 

**SPAC:**

It is true that the SPAC market has softened recently. It is very reasonable to assume $UWMC is a part of that softening. It may not attract institutional investors because of the SPAC situation and the short period it has been publicly traded. Lots of other nice places to put institutional money.

**Competitors:** Mortgages are a mature market and competition is fierce. Rocket, LoanDepot and UWM mentioned a pricing war in their earnings. (LD statement). This will compress loan sale margins in the short term. 

**What trends are pushing $UWMC stock up?** 

**Short term retail pressure:**

there is a lot of retail attention on the potential short squeeze/gamma squeeze you could see this week in UWMC. My post is about UWM‚Äôs long term perspective, so I‚Äôll let [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ndcm0p/uwmc_is_a_powderkeg_low_float_high_short_huge/) take you further down that rabbit hole. Additionally, smart money is now tracking online sentiment, which can lead to increased institutional purchases. 

**Broker Channel Growth:** Mat has claimed two reasons for taking UWM public. He wanted access to the liquidity market and marketing exposure for the broker channel. For UWM to become the largest mortgage originator, Mat has targeted ‚Öì mortgages to be originated by brokers and UWM to own 50% of that channel by 2025/26. Currently UWM owns 36% of the broker channel with brokers originating 20% of all mortgages. Before the housing crisis in 2008, brokers were 58% of mortgage originations (Per Mat & Q1 2021 Earnings call), so it isn‚Äôt crazy to think they could get back to ‚Öì as it is growing: [https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum](https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum)

I had a loan with Rocket and tried to refinance with them. I then went through a mortgage broker and got the same loan for $4.5k cheaper in closing costs. This is because Rocket‚Äôs retail channel has 4% margins and it‚Äôs partnership network (includes wholesale, realtors, etc.) has 1% margins. 

**New Product Offerings:** 

UWM recently released new products like their jumbo loan. In earnings, Mat said he expects $2b in volume from Jumbo. They also added ARM‚Äôs, manufactured homes and expanded government programs. 

**Wholesale mortgage provider consolidation:** 

Mat said 3 of the top 25 wholesale lenders have been purchased in the last 90 days. This type of consolidation happens in mature markets by companies that are reaching for market share. THis could be a sign companies are under pressure to grow but cannot organically get market share from UWM. 

**UWM ‚ÄúAll In‚Äù Ultimatum:** 

Rocket and Fairway are priortizing other channels (cause the margins are so much higher) and trying to squeeze out brokers. UWM said if you work with those two, don‚Äôt work for us. The goal was to stand up for the broker channel WHILE putting some pressure on Rocket and Fairway‚Äôs partnership channel. This may have kickstarted the pricing war. 

**Aggressive Capital returns:** 

UWM pays an annual .40 dividend on its class A shares. That only costs them \~$42m/year. Remember their Q1 net income was $800m+. So their dividends hardly affect the balance sheet. The board just approved a $300/million share buyback as well that will reduce share count. Mat knows a thing or two about shorting stocks. He just sold at $10 and has authority to buy back with the current price under $8. The man successfully shorted his own company. What a legend. 

**Long Term Prediction:** 

I‚Äôm invested in UWM because I believe the capital returns will be aggressive during the upswing and the company will remain profitable in a downturn. With a 5%+ dividend return, share buyback, and \*potentially\* growing market share, UWM could be primed to overtake Rocket within the next few years.

7959,,2021-05-17 14:45:52,t3_nei5qk,,wallstreetbets,"As the cloud & big data continues to grow, as well as social media & 4k/8k video, data storage is becoming more important than ever.

Large social media sites take in a tremendous amount of data each day. This storage must not only be stored, but stored with redundancy as well as backups. Major sites such as Facebook and YouTube keep content that is over a decade old. Over time, the drives holding this content will fail and need to be replaced, leading to growing recurring demand as the size of the platform grows.

The need for storage has been growing for decades, but innovation in storage density and intense competition has limited profitability in the market in the past. That being said, there is reason to believe that the growth in storage density may stop keeping up with the growth in storage needs.

There is also reason to believe that transient growth in storage demand may drive higher Q2 earnings. A new digital currency, Chia, has gobbled up about 6 Exabytes worth of storage in the past 3 weeks, now growing at a rate of about 0.4 EiB per day(and rising). https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/netspace

For reference, about 288 Exabytes worth of hard drives were shipped in Q1 2021 https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hdd-shipments-in-q1-2021

Chia network size can be considered a lagging indicator for unexpected drive shipments. Generally, it can take a few weeks between when a drive is purchased and when it's actually accounted for on the network, as it takes time for it to be shipped, set up, and plotted. Chia wasn't even listed on exchanges until a couple weeks ago, so most of the growth seen is prior to Chia even having a price. At current prices, mining is incredibly profitable, with a $500 14 TB drive estimated to produce about $26 per day, and using very little power. So even if the network grows 10x to 60 Exabytes, it's still producing $3/day at current prices. So expect the surge in demand to continue.

I have seen many anecdotes of drive shortages over the past couple weeks. Reviewing sites like Amazon, I have also seen high capacity drives go out of stock or require lead times of a few weeks.

This may be a bit reminiscent of GPU shortages among Nvidia and AMD as miners seek to buy up anything they can.

If we project continued growth at 0.4 Exabytes a day in unexpected demand from proof of storage over the next 40 days, plus the 6 Exabytes added since April 20(leaving out first 3 weeks in quarter as they were likely logged last quarter), that's about 22 Exabytes to be added in Q2 that are not part of normal usage, or about an extra ~8% of Q1 demand.

What's perhaps most interesting is the impact this could have on margins. Unlike the GPUs used to mine which are consumer devices, the devices used for mining Chia includes enterprise grade hardware. Prices in the drive market are more flexible at the manufacturer level, and currently have much lower margins. If proof of storage currencies cause a drive shortage, it could have a significant impact on margins. Western digital sells about 40% of its drives through distributors, Seagate about 30%. Sales through these channels generally are very responsive to demand trends in terms of prices.

Seagate is also in a position to profit from this, but I'm a bit more worried about them as hard drive shipments have been on a long term decline and they aren't diversified into SSDs/flash like Western Digital is.

The EMA (EU medical agency like FDA) announced Myovant and Relugolix as up for review to be accepted for Marketing approval in the EU this week. This is a huge catalyst in the biotech industry, and due to their Pfizer partnership this could result in a 50m cash payment to Myovant as well.

They also have an FDA PDUFA deadline of June 1 for a second application (their first of three was approved in December). If approved this would result in a 100m cash payment from Pfizer.

Alone, these are major catalysts. Right now they stand to go back to back on these catalysts. The last time the company had one catalyst like this, **they were rocketed past $30 a share and gained a strategic partnership from Pfizer.**

Now those are two major catalysts within two weeks, **if FDA decides early, both could happen this week.**

Due to the triple threat data put up in clinical trials and the fact that they had this data peer reviewed and published in the New England journal of medicine, there is strong confidence of approval on the company‚Äôs end.

Last but not least, they have additional catalysts still inbound after. Including Part D and Medicare coverage expected by July 1. All encompassed with a possible buyout from sumitomo.

If you're looking for a good article that covers the basics, you can search the below. Theres also some great posts on reddit and stock twits. I am also happy to answer any questions.

*Why The Misunderstood Pfizer Deal Makes Myovant A Great Low-Risk Investment*

**Quick list of upcoming catalysts:**

THIS WEEK: EMA meets to possibly approve sale of orgovyx in Europe

By June 1: Deadline for FDA approval for a second use case (this could come early and will result in another 100m cash payment from Pfizer)

By July 1: Part d and Medicare coverage: also supposed to be obtained before July 1 for prostate cancer application

Pfizer optionality: Pfizer can opt in to have the rights to sell this in some markets, resulting in a 50m cash payment and royalties paid to myovant. Submission of relugolix for the treatment of endometriosis to the FDA

Catalysts that could happen at any time:  **BUYOUT** from Sumitomo ( aka Sumitovant) or other interested partner (See Urovant history. Sumi has a patent cliff in 2023 they are trying to patch with acquisitions, has purchased 4 of movants sister companies and already owns 53.5% of myovant).

Strategic acquisition of new drug candidates to further myovants pipeline.

**TLDR:**

EU and FDA approvals for drug candidates are expected within the next 2 weeks and could propel this to the moon.

It sounds like an impossibility, but there are simple ways to reading a price chart that enable you to come very close to predicting the direction and turning points of a stock. One of the most important ways is through the identification and marking of channel line patterns.

&#x200B;

[ Prices respect the channel lines ](https://preview.redd.it/fqzpk486qpz61.png?width=1067&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5b02809e77b0f9d4f8162cd558a98154a5aad8e)

Channels lines are one of the most important patterns found on a price chart. They enable you to find the broader trend, or overall direction prices are heading, which is crucial towards choosing the direction of your trade. Sticking with the trend - going long on an uptrend and short on a downtrend - aligns you with the higher probability direction, already setting yourself up for a probable trade.

They also enable you to anticipate and profit from areas where the price has a high likelihood of reversing through a ""bounce"" - where prices hit an upper or lower side of the channel and bounce off of the level like a ball, and heading into the opposite direction. These are key areas because unlike a random point in the chart, a channel line presents a point that has a higher probability of doing one thing over another - *this is an example of where ""edge"" comes from - finding scenarios where one outcome is more likely than the other, and betting on it.*

&#x200B;

[ Channel line pattern with bounces circled ](https://preview.redd.it/f0l668a7qpz61.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=658f753348044acec2cceeaa1dfbf4c6288ae0ff)

## How do you define a channel pattern?

A channel line pattern exists when prices are moving between two parallel trendlines. A trendline is a straight line drawn to connect several major turning points, or swings, in the price chart. When there are two identifiable trendlines that are parallel to each other forming a straight band, prices are *trading within a channel*.

&#x200B;

[ A trendline drawn off of the highs ](https://preview.redd.it/fcfpptc8qpz61.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc81911e78d6e9ee5012760fc53e05f6200513b2)

Trendlines and channels are drawings that highlight the foundational concept of understanding price charts - support and resistance. Support is a level that lies underneath the current price that historically has acted as a cushion for prices, slowing their momentum or causing them to turn right around. Resistance is a level that lies above the current price that historically has acted as a barrier for prices, slowing their momentum or causing a reversal. In this way, support and resistance are one and the same - they are levels that ""support"" or ""resist"", keeping prices within their confines until they lose their power.

&#x200B;

>Prices will often ""test"" support and resistance multiple times and the level will successfully hold, creating areas with a high probability of a bounce - therefore creating trading opportunities.

## How to Draw Channel Lines

So, trendlines connect two or more support or resistance zones, which are areas where prices reversed or showed slowing momentum. Channels are two parallel trendlines. With that, *how can you draw a channel line on a price chart*?

The first consideration is if there is a channel at all. Often, there are ample opportunities to draw trendlines - straight lines connecting s/r. However, it is less often that the chart shows another parallel trendline that price has interacted with. Thus, a textbook ""channel"" with prices neatly filling in the space and bouncing off of the lines is not as easy as it seems to find - **this actually makes the pattern more important, as the discovery of a true channel pattern can lead to very clean bounces and high probability, low risk trades.**

To draw a channel, first find a trendline. Connect important swing lows or highs, and try to find a way to draw a line that connects two or more of the swings, while keeping all of of the other price movement between the swings above the line.

&#x200B;

[ First trendline duplicated and dragged to mark swing lows ](https://preview.redd.it/ss3uggaaqpz61.png?width=561&format=png&auto=webp&s=56e6198235392485a05edaddc3f8d0da4d802d4c)

>A trendline is only as significant as the prices' respect for it - there is no validity to drawing a trendline that connects two swings, while is broken by three other spikes.

Once you've found the trendline, either duplicate the trendline you have just drawn, or if using a channel drawing tool, simply drag the parallel line to see if it can connect two more swings on the opposite side of the price movement.

It takes *a lot* of practice to begin to properly draw channel lines that are valid and are respected by prices. Drawing channel patterns that match historical price charts is hard - and drawing them in a way that can successfully anticipate *future* price movements is even more of a learned skill. This can only be improved by practicing drawing channels on many different charts.

## Types of Channel Lines

The direction of channel lines determine the type of channel pattern. A channel pointed at an upward sloping angle signals an uptrend. A channel pointed at a downward angle signals a downtrend. A channel with a horizontal slope signals a range.

&#x200B;

[ Uptrend ](https://preview.redd.it/s8h4o1xbqpz61.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=1df032e442d4dddf112e30748baedcff16656291)

A concept that is helpful in the identification of a channel's direction is the presence of swing highs and lows. If prices are making higher swings high (peaks) and higher swings low (troughs), chances are they are in an uptrend. If prices are making lower highs and lower lows, they are likely in a downtrend. If there are equal or mismatching swing lows and highs, and prices look more horizontal, a range is likely in play.

&#x200B;

[ Downtrend with channel break ](https://preview.redd.it/wovf3mvcqpz61.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0029bb3d64ea2cb1da1b122a2e477cd0ce827d)

In a trending market, sticking with the direction of the trend can put you on the higher probability side. Combined with an entry identified by the channel lines, this can form the basis of a trading strategy.

In a ranging market, where prices are simply bouncing between two horizontal support and resistance trendlines, any time prices approach or touch the channel lines can be a significant reversal area, where there is a higher probability of a bounce than a breakout through the line.

&#x200B;

[Range](https://preview.redd.it/6z1kj65eqpz61.png?width=1019&format=png&auto=webp&s=3196922b3ddd01cd806ca9f100aa01918bf0b766)

## The Midline and Channel Pattern Breaks

Many channel drawing tools can display a midline, or a line 50% away from both trendlines. This line can serve as an important secondary trendline or support/resistance zone, and often prices react to the midline in a less apparent, but still significant way. Additionally, sometimes prices will break the channel line and form a new high outside of the channel. When this happens, the broken trendline can sometimes become the midline of a wider channel that incorporates the new swing.

&#x200B;

[ Upper channel line turned into midline after breakout ](https://preview.redd.it/wz5gw1peqpz61.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=68d55d124e5799ccc86ac01d5f860786ef24d183)

*When prices break a channel line, it is a sign that the pattern is losing validity.* The trend may be losing steam or accelerating, based on if it breaks the lower or the upper line. A channel line pattern is most valid when there are no price breaks of the trendlines. When prices break the countertrend side (the lower line in an uptrend or the upper line in a downtrend), you can anticipate a reversal soon. When prices break the with-trend side, the trend has accelerated, and you may need to redraw your channel line. This can also be seen as an expenditure of momentum which can bring a trend channel back into a range or a reversal.

## How to Trade With Channel Lines

Because channel line patterns offer areas that have *a higher probability of moving in one direction over the other*, trading strategies can be formed around the pattern. After identifying a valid channel, a strategy may look to buy or sell as price touches the with-trend channel line, setting a stop loss level based on volatility, Fibonacci extensions, or a selection of indicators that can identify momentum and turning points. A take profit level could be determined by a significant support/resistance level, Fibonacci retracements, or indicators similar to those used in stop placement.

&#x200B;

[ A channel bounce trade with \>2:1 risk:reward ](https://preview.redd.it/f24xyxqfqpz61.png?width=1521&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae05a98cdfdfcfb19552fbff3bbb2b5b4331ba7a)

The key advantage to trading channel bounces is the **high risk to reward** offered. A tight stop loss can allow for a high R:R ratio even with a high probability, modest profit target level. Thus, the strategy utilizes *a high probability turning point, a tight stop loss, and a modest profit target* which culminates into a trading plan with a healthy win rate and risk to reward ratio.

Finally, an overlooked aspect of using channels:

&#x200B;

>Channel line patterns have one final key importance to trading - they let you know when to not be in. This helps to reinforce a golden rule of trading - only look to enter trades when there is a higher probability of one thing happening over the other. By watching your channel lines, you'll know when it's there.

&#x200B;

[ Channels force you to be patient and wait for the turning points ](https://preview.redd.it/d3asavogqpz61.png?width=1063&format=png&auto=webp&s=42024fd0d87b9df76edf37e8c33df58b4675684c)

7971,,2021-05-17 17:38:52,t3_nemlpe,,wallstreetbets,"So right now, the mainstream narrative is that inflation is going to run red hot mostly due to a rally in commodity prices. This inflation has the potential to be more than transitory, meaning it lasts more than a couple of quarters at most and will result in forcing the FED to raise rates and crash growth stocks. This is why tech stocks are underperforming while value, or more specifically, manufacturing and mining companies outperform (look at XME for example).

My question is if that is the case, then why are steel futures for U.S. Midwest Domestic Hot-Rolled Coil Steel going down [CME Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/ferrous/hrc-steel_quotes_globex.html)? Right now they peak in June at $1,520 a tonne before steadily going down for the foreseeable future.

Similar things can be said about other commodities such as copper, which remains relatively steady before gradually going down going into next year [Copper Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/base/copper_quotes_globex.html).

On the agriculture side, major commodities like corn appear to be peaking in the near future as well [Corn Futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/grain-and-oilseed/corn_quotes_globex.html).

So taking all of this into account, it would appear that the shape of the futures curves would indicate that commodity prices would peak in near future before gradually going down as supply meets demand. Shouldn't this mean that inflation is indeed transitory as the FED predicts? What am I missing here?

**Tl;Dr:** Futures are showing commodity prices going down in the near future which should drag down inflation rates. Are inflation fears misplaced?",nemlpe,Are Commodity Futures Going Against The Mainstream Inflation Narrative?

Sit back... relax and enjoy.   If you worry in a bull market, I can't even imagine in a bear market! 

Gold & silver's monthly defined 2021 road map still intact.  Q2 and Q4 belong to silver, while gold will shine in Q3. 

Silver's Masterpiece! We already have a yearly confirmed breakout for silver! Now, if you want to play it safe, wait for a 2020 close above 17.15$, then this could very well be the lowest risk, highest reward play of your lifetime!

Silver's open interest (including options) MACD shows an insane setup for silver.

Question is... how high? Greedy analog move yields 73$ in Q4 2021.

Tic toc ?

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and Gold and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

My assumptions : 3% -3.5 %, yields 2,70-3% , USA Growth 5 -6 %  . There is no doomsday or hyperinflation !!!

As stated in my previous post this is not economic boom this is just recovery . 

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term. 

I am an ape as like you , This is not financial advise just my personal targets .

It's no secret that companies hire teams of people to brainstorm, draft, and send tweets, but even with the millions of dollars spent on this process it is rare for corporate twitter accounts to have big spikes in followers. Wendy's can obviously tweet some witty stuff that will get lots of likes and retweets, but this usually doesn't motivate most people to sign up for extra ads on their timeline by actually following these accounts.

Wingstop, however, cracked the code on Wednesday by denying the presence of ejaculate in their special white sauce. On Wednesday, one customer tweeted ""wingstop ranch gotta have nut in it no way it‚Äôs just that good"" to which Wingstop replied ""it's a special white sauce but it does not contain \[nut\]""

The rest of the conversation did not contain any more trade secrets on the Wingstop recipe, but it was notable in its own way.

[Twitter screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/2rmwspravqz61.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=090ca925fe321799a1934ea2edfc746480922449)

I rarely ever see companies with hundreds of thousands of followers (Wingstop has over 200k) receive over a 5% increase in Twitter followers over a week. Wingstop had a 10% gain in a matter of days.

The market seemingly reacted with disappointment to the lack of bodily fluids in the secret recipe as $WING fell 2% in the day following the exchange.",nerobc,"Wingstop ($WING) has 11% growth in Twitter followers, 3% drop in stock price after denying that their special white sauce contains human ejaculate"

8000,,2021-05-17 21:46:48,t3_nesw0u,,wallstreetbets,"Hey Guys, it's me again. I think you guys may remember me, after all I wrote an extensive series of DD over a month on UWMC through its trials and tribulations, in anticipation of it's breakout moment. You might even remember my YOLO, and remembered I continuously added to it. And that I eventually upped my margin to 13.5k on it. Well, I'm here to tell you that I'm not out. I bought more calls to average down, on earnings day, and I held them when they tanked to ten cents a pop. My only regret is that I didn't buy more then. Though I threw a bit more cash into shares!

Back then, I said the Theta Beta's would regret selling those calls, and it was one of the few plays where there wouldn't be IV Crush. I was right. Their probably a little sour. Sorry chaps, you usually are the one's making money at our expense. This time it's going to have to be the other way around....

Today, I had the chance to exit my options for a 47% profit roughly. Sell calls for a chunky profit after that. I said no. You know why? Because fuck the people who shorted an extremely profitable company to 6.26 dollars, that's why. The Fear, the Uncertainty, and the Doubt people expressed to me regarding this company espoused to me because of the actions of those people gave me an aneurysm. So fuck them. We're playing Pac Man people. The CEO of UWMC is reducing the float, and increasing the percentage of the float that is sold short while increasing buying pressure. We're buying up the stock to get the price to 9-10 because people bought options for 5-10 cents and they'll be in the money quite easily. And because of the rising volume, every day the CEO is able to buy more and more shares thanks to Rule 10B. The delta on the options is low, and they will need to hedge as the price heads steadily upward on Friday. Then the Shorts are going to be squeezed even further as the market makers hedge.

So no, I won't sell my options for a 10 or a 50% profit. I'm going to sell my options at a price I damn well want to. One that compensates me for the trouble that these people have given me. And so should you.

I understand people have taken profits, but honestly, at the price point they were selling at the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. Good for them though. Next time, could you at least sell deep ITM covered calls though lmao.

And for those people on the fucking fence. You jumped onto MVIS, you jumped into GME, and AMC, and all manners of companies that are either unprofitable or make very little money. But the fucking BOOMER stock is where you hesitate the fence?! The fucking (Eyy Lmaooo) Boomer stock, giving you a 4.87% dividend? The one that, if you somehow baghold can give you 10-15% cash returns through divitendies and covered calls until you get assigned at a strike that is profitable to you? The 10-15% backboard cash that can fund all your yolo's? That's the fucking stock you hesitate on? El LMAO. The companies margins will expand hard in a few months, and it's still hugely profitable at a less than 1 percent margin so yeah. Now if you were buying at 14 fucking bucks, you're a dumb ape, but yeah.

I'm fucking going to ride my options to a fucking profit margin that compensates me for the shit they pulled, or to a GUH. No in between. The Stock Buyback middle finger is just the fucking sweetener.

Matt Daddy, and I, and all the people who everyone called bag holders are going to skull fuck the shorters harder than they skull fucked UWMC's share price. They're going to fucking Guh their way into a fucking shoebox. Fuck em. I want me tendies well cooked, a side of fries, and a foot massage. And their going to give it to me. And to all of you who bought, and are buying UWMC.

This is not financial advice, this is a layup. But seriously, i'm not a financial advisor, and you do you with your money.

They did it with blockbuster but they were more vocal about it, and in turn their stock price plummeted for 4 years because the people found out what they did after they went under and hiked prices by 60%. *but that was soon forgotten*

The setup is a symmetrical triangle. Normally when continuation patterns come from downside - they have a bearish bias. However - we broke that red trendline  with an uptick in volume - this was a hint we were ready for an actual reversal. That trendline kept us in a downtrend for about 4 months. Not only that but...

**TODAY WE BROKE THE SYMMETRICAL TRIANGLE UP - WHICH MEANS ITS FULL SPEED AHEAD!**

Confluence between technicals generate the best signals.

This is the best the setup has looked since GME was at 10. Price target for this is 231.52 resistance initially, followed by 348.50. Breakout is invalid and play is dead if we get a daily close back under 158.11.

And... that's it.

I've been trading for a long time and only use patterns, trendlines & volume. Keep it simple. You don't need to waste 100 hours doing 15 paragraphs of DD for one swing trade - or look at 100 different indicators cherry picking the ones that say your position will go up.

***TL;DR*** \- GME actually looks good for once from an **unbiased** technical standpoint

***EDIT:*** Clarification - I wasn't speaking for GME as a whole when I said it was dead under 158.11 - I simply meant this setup in particular was no longer valid. It could always form a new one.

AMC READY TO FLY.

Plenty of DD has been done on AMC and why its going to take off - I'm not here to talk about that. It is coiled, has popped, and is ready to rip a new butthole in the sky.

$CNK is AMCs largest competitor and is in the great business we know as movie theaters. When AMC last went crazy, CNK ran up over 56% in a few days from 22-27 of January to $27+. In the past month, AMC is up over 50%. CNK is roughly even. It is lagging behind and is due for a major pop on this AMC craze. It is a classically more boring stock that takes a big nudge to move.

Breaking out similar to AMC. Insanely strong volume shelf in low 20s (high demand) and above 1D 21MA. RSI has lots of room to run. 

**MARGIN**

CNK has a much lower implied volatility and actually allows for margin borrowing. This could be attractive depending on your risk appetite

**DILUTION/FINANCIALS**

CNK has almost no share dilution since the pandemic started, and it has been historically stronger than AMC from a traditional (retarded) financial perspective. AMCs market value growth has passed CNKs by many multiples over the past year. No reason she can't get some love.

Is UWMC that much better that I should ditch RKT? If so please explain.

I know RKT guidance is down but 


- the P/E ratio of under 7 is extremely cheap

- They have a great current ratio

- They are profitable which is great during inflation times like now. Revenue and earnings are steady in guidance for the next two years 

- Possible addition to S&P 500

- Dominant name in the industry


This is a conversation around fundamentals. If UWMC is a pure short squeeze I understand but I think RKT is so much better than it‚Äôs valued or forecasted to perform relative to other stocks in the broader market. Also I‚Äôm not a hater I think both stocks (RKT and UWMC) can do great over the next 5 years.",nf1xrj,Why is RKT dead to WSB?

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season!

[**Anders Bylund**](https://boards.fool.com/profile/TMFZahrim/info.aspx) **(Nokia):** Few tech stocks have weathered the recent market storm quite like Finnish telecom infrastructure veteran Nokia. The stock has gained 32% since the New Year, including a 14% jump over the last 30 days. By contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is trading flat in 2021 and fell 7% in the last month.

This stock may feel like a joke due to the recent influx of Nokia interest from the Reddit-based WallStreetBets group, but that's just a coincidence. Nokia's real-world business prospects are solid and the stock is actually undervalued, even though it dodged the tech-stock market correction in recent months.

Nokia's solid market position was built on a foundation of [5G network](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) installations. Top-line sales are rising faster than expected, Nokia's profit margin is expanding as we speak thanks to the richer product mix, and the stock is changing hands for less than eight times free cash flow. You don't see that combination of deep-discount stock prices and robust business trends very often, and that makes Nokia a no-brainer buy right now.",ne3k42,Nokia an industry leader in the bargain bin

Home Depot reports earnings premarket 5/18. HD has beat earnings consistently and the share price has reacted negatively each time. In this market I feel like the play here is a strangle. My proposed play is the closest to the money strikes. Right now based on $324 list that would be the 5/21 323.5P/325C. You are in for about $1k. Break even is 3% in either direction. Of course we are hoping for 6% at least.

November earnings was a beat and the stock dropped 6% that day. That would be 100% profit with the trade I propose for educational purposes only. The previous report had a -3.2% drop that day which would still print.

Here is the kicker. The 5 day high is $344 (5/10) and low $317 (5/12) for a 2 day swing of 8.4% bases on Friday close. This is key because it means there is the potential for both sides of the strangle to be profitable prior to expiration! Nuts right?

Here is how to play it. Watch the housing report tomorrow (5/17). With lumber prices being insane new construction might be a miss. If HD stock goes down you will need to consider if the market will price this in when digesting an earnings miss. You will want to wait until the end of the day to enter the strangle to make sure you have strikes that put the Monday close in the middle.

If earnings are a beat and the prices goes up >3% sell the call once you are happy with the profit. Lock in your tuition money because again, this is for education. Same goes for the inverse. Then you have until Friday to try to get tendies with the other side. Can't remember the Vince Vaughn line from Dodge ball but it think it's ""that's what we call the jackpot"".

Not WSB material you say? Earnings plays are inherently gambling and sir, this is a casino.

Positions: none yet. Ask me at 3PM tomorrow you illiterate ape.

TLDR: Home Depot is usually located in  very close proximity to a Wendy's = tendies.

I‚Äôm a bull here for technical reasons. However, the fundamentals make sense here now as well.

I  have shared my thoughts on UWMC in past. The company announced Q1  earnings and while they look like they are below expectations it was  explained by the CEO that because of the speed of their execution, their  results are reflective of the higher rate environment already while  competitors are lagged.

During    the Q4 2020 earnings call he  had mused about options that would be on    the stable, special dividend,  buyback or raising the dividend.

**Feb Q4 Earnings Quote:**

The     Board did approve a dividend, a $0.10 quarterly dividend to be  paid    on  April 6 for all shareholders of record as of March 10. **We expect  this to be a regular quarterly dividend**.

And     so you guys know how we're thinking about this. Our balance sheet   is  a   fortress. And our current liquidity position is very strong, and    we   have access to the capital markets as well. The way we think  about   this   going forward is we're producing a lot of cash. We're  going to   maybe   be more profitable than some expected and be very  successful in   2021.   And **if we have excess cash that I and the Board deem is too much,  we will be delivering that back**. And whether we have to **change     the  dividend in the future, as in raise it or a special dividend,     those  things are definitely on the table or even buying back shares**.

**May Q1 Earnings Quote:**

As     you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of      $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a      record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I always  **explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special  dividend or a share buyback program**. As you guys have seen, we **concluded      share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward   shareholders.    We announced the authorization of $300 million share   buyback over the    next 24 months**.  And **quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that**.

**Then in answering a question from an analyst**

Doug    Harter -  Great. And then just in terms of capital return, you    mentioned sort of  the float. I  guess just how are you thinking about    kind of **how much of  the float  you'd be willing to take out and pacing around share  repurchase**?

Mat Ishbia -  Yes, Doug. So I'm learning these rules as we go **because at this stock  price, I'm a buyer, right**?    And so we'll buy shares as soon as tomorrow, I  think, as our legal    teams say we're allowed to do. And so I don't know  how many I can buy    and what I can do, but I'm very conscientious of the  float.  If the    float was not a concern, **we'd be more aggressive**. However,  **we     have authorization from the Board to buy up to $300 million, and I'm      going to take advantage of that opportunity while being  conscientious     of our partners in the float.**

TL/DR:     UWMC and their board have been looking at ways to give back to     shareholders. Instead of a short term cash out, they decided on a     buyback that they are planning to exercise immediately on so that they     can retire shares while the SP is low. They will NOT buy so much that   it   will ruin their float % for Russell. The CEO is aggressive, has    approval to spend $300 and he's going to take FULL advantage.  The CEO has stated he is a BUYER! They are  not   waiting, it's being deployed now.

Disclosure I am still in long position with 25K  at 8.39 USD shares of UWMC

Stochastic's oversold and the RSI is closely following. On a shorter time frame we can see that bulls finished the Friday session off strong positioning us in a nice spot technically as we are sitting on the 20day SMA.

If we can open above 6.9 (50day SMA) I think we can close around that 7.14 (200day SMA) level which should line us up for that move out of the $6-$8 range and into the $10s and beyond.

Now funny enough what actually has me the most bullish this morning is looking at Friday alone. Selling pressure was suppressed by the bulls and it closed right near HOD above all major resistances.

UWMC is ready to pop!

I was in UWMC for the value play. It is a STEAL at 10$ on fundamentals anything below that is an insane deal. Even above 10 has a strong long-term argument.

Here is UWMC in a nutshell: heavily shorted, borrow costs skyrocketing, mortgage industry hit overly hard on fears of rising interest rates, the CEO Ishiba announces a 300M stock buyback, and shorts are QUAKING. UP 6% in premarket following being up 1-2% Friday. This puts at starting at $8 Monday with $9 being a CRITICAL Friday target for us.

All UWMC needs is a little unexpected retail buying pressure and it POPS! In truth this is not just a short squeeze, its multiple plays rolled into one. We have retail buying hype train going (obviously, look at all the WSB posts here posted below), short-squeeze due to high cost of borrow, Gamma squeeze due to the MASSIVE options interest, 300M stock buyback by CEO to scare off the shorts, an unfair post-earnings plunge, plus good-ole\` company doing good things (making money).

We coming back for some of our loyal bagholders that have been holding UWMC since the last train to $14, hey guys remember to take profit this time ;)

It is now cost-prohibitive to use more shorts to keep the price low. The normal dirty tricks triple in price so become less-used. Shorts use this borrow price to determine feasibility and 93% is obviously unfeasible, THEY WILL COVER. Once one group starts covering and causes a spike, other shorts will rush to do the same.

It's a prisoner's dilemma and HF's want to cut each other's throats just as much as ours. Let's let them!!!

Many of these 7.50,9. 10, and 12 are OTM or barely ITM. and an early week spike to put 9c ITM would force MM's to hedge to delta-neutral...further pushing 10c and 12.50 c into hedge territory. This can quickly cause things to spiral out of control for shorts.

Stock BuyBack,

Ishbia is going to war with the shorts and his weapon of choice is a 300M stock buyback (similar to RKT's special dividend for the same purpose). The buyback could have started happening as early as May 11th.

Most of the float is owned by institutions and insiders so this buyback puts increased pressure of a heavily shorted (13%+) and heavily held float pool.

Retail is gorging on the float, institutions are holding the float, and Ishbia is buying the free float up. This is a recipe for ROCKET FUEL. WIth shorts paying 93%, they will stop shorting so the shares we are buying are REAL, not synthetic.

Make them buy real shares, from us, at 20$ each.

I am in UWMC for the long-term VALUE-PLAY and like the stock. I like the company., I like the CEO. I like the market position. I like the value. I ilke the stock.

I am loading up on 6/18 8c options. Options are important as we move up to force MM's to buy to remain market neutral.

Options do not pay unless we buy shares, so I suggest splitting half/half to each. options can cause MM's to balance risk and lead to large upswings but this cannot happen without buying pressure and the underlying spiking to necessitate balancing risk, which means we need to buy stocks as well.

Options are good for Gamma Squeeze/MM's balance buys (and profit) but shares are needed to keep the underlying JOOSED and keep those options deep ITM.

MIX IT UP!

This is the final call for the UWMC tendie train so get your fucking tickets and remember; Gravy costs extra,

8150,,2021-05-17 13:20:55,t3_neg3ey,,wallstreetbets,"$UWMC has become one of the most hyped stocks in the online investment community. Online activity appears to be ramping up after earnings and heading into May 21st option expiries. Since UWM is getting a lot of new eyes, it seemed like an appropriate time to share why some investors may consider UWM as a long term hold. 

UWM is a mortgage company that focuses exclusively on the broker channel. It‚Äôs the largest wholesale mortgage provider in the US and the second largest mortgage originator, behind Rocket Companies. 

It‚Äôs CEO is Mat Ishbia, who started as it‚Äôs 12th employee and who‚Äôs dad, Jeff, started the company as a side hustle. Mat and his brother own 94% of the company in Class D shares. The rest of the public float, \~100m Class A shares, are what is available for the public to purchase. 

# What trends are pushing $UWMC‚Äôs stock down? 

**The largest threat UWM is facing is raising interest rates**: 

About 75% of UWM income is related to refinance activity. The pandemic pushed rates to historic lows so most consumers were better off refinancing. Millions have done that, leading to record profit for mortgage providers like UWM and Rocket. 

**The strength of the broker channel:**

UWM is completely dependent on brokers finding business and closing loans. It doesn‚Äôt have any direct-to-consumer lending operations like Rocket does. 

**Short Interest:** 

Sophisticated investors are seeing 75% of income potentially attached to rate sensitive products (not all refi‚Äôs are rate sensitive like cash out), and are salivating. They think the market is under appreciating this headwind and shorting the stock. They have basically shorted all the shares they can. Friday the stock ended with 200 shares available and an insane 93% borrow rate. 

**SPAC:**

It is true that the SPAC market has softened recently. It is very reasonable to assume $UWMC is a part of that softening. It may not attract institutional investors because of the SPAC situation and the short period it has been publicly traded. Lots of other nice places to put institutional money.

**Competitors:** Mortgages are a mature market and competition is fierce. Rocket, LoanDepot and UWM mentioned a pricing war in their earnings. (LD statement). This will compress loan sale margins in the short term. 

**What trends are pushing $UWMC stock up?** 

**Short term retail pressure:**

there is a lot of retail attention on the potential short squeeze/gamma squeeze you could see this week in UWMC. My post is about UWM‚Äôs long term perspective, so I‚Äôll let [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ndcm0p/uwmc_is_a_powderkeg_low_float_high_short_huge/) take you further down that rabbit hole. Additionally, smart money is now tracking online sentiment, which can lead to increased institutional purchases. 

**Broker Channel Growth:** Mat has claimed two reasons for taking UWM public. He wanted access to the liquidity market and marketing exposure for the broker channel. For UWM to become the largest mortgage originator, Mat has targeted ‚Öì mortgages to be originated by brokers and UWM to own 50% of that channel by 2025/26. Currently UWM owns 36% of the broker channel with brokers originating 20% of all mortgages. Before the housing crisis in 2008, brokers were 58% of mortgage originations (Per Mat & Q1 2021 Earnings call), so it isn‚Äôt crazy to think they could get back to ‚Öì as it is growing: [https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum](https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum)

I had a loan with Rocket and tried to refinance with them. I then went through a mortgage broker and got the same loan for $4.5k cheaper in closing costs. This is because Rocket‚Äôs retail channel has 4% margins and it‚Äôs partnership network (includes wholesale, realtors, etc.) has 1% margins. 

**New Product Offerings:** 

UWM recently released new products like their jumbo loan. In earnings, Mat said he expects $2b in volume from Jumbo. They also added ARM‚Äôs, manufactured homes and expanded government programs. 

**Wholesale mortgage provider consolidation:** 

Mat said 3 of the top 25 wholesale lenders have been purchased in the last 90 days. This type of consolidation happens in mature markets by companies that are reaching for market share. THis could be a sign companies are under pressure to grow but cannot organically get market share from UWM. 

**UWM ‚ÄúAll In‚Äù Ultimatum:** 

Rocket and Fairway are priortizing other channels (cause the margins are so much higher) and trying to squeeze out brokers. UWM said if you work with those two, don‚Äôt work for us. The goal was to stand up for the broker channel WHILE putting some pressure on Rocket and Fairway‚Äôs partnership channel. This may have kickstarted the pricing war. 

**Aggressive Capital returns:** 

UWM pays an annual .40 dividend on its class A shares. That only costs them \~$42m/year. Remember their Q1 net income was $800m+. So their dividends hardly affect the balance sheet. The board just approved a $300/million share buyback as well that will reduce share count. Mat knows a thing or two about shorting stocks. He just sold at $10 and has authority to buy back with the current price under $8. The man successfully shorted his own company. What a legend. 

**Long Term Prediction:** 

I‚Äôm invested in UWM because I believe the capital returns will be aggressive during the upswing and the company will remain profitable in a downturn. With a 5%+ dividend return, share buyback, and \*potentially\* growing market share, UWM could be primed to overtake Rocket within the next few years.

8154,,2021-05-17 14:45:52,t3_nei5qk,,wallstreetbets,"As the cloud & big data continues to grow, as well as social media & 4k/8k video, data storage is becoming more important than ever.

Large social media sites take in a tremendous amount of data each day. This storage must not only be stored, but stored with redundancy as well as backups. Major sites such as Facebook and YouTube keep content that is over a decade old. Over time, the drives holding this content will fail and need to be replaced, leading to growing recurring demand as the size of the platform grows.

The need for storage has been growing for decades, but innovation in storage density and intense competition has limited profitability in the market in the past. That being said, there is reason to believe that the growth in storage density may stop keeping up with the growth in storage needs.

There is also reason to believe that transient growth in storage demand may drive higher Q2 earnings. A new digital currency, Chia, has gobbled up about 6 Exabytes worth of storage in the past 3 weeks, now growing at a rate of about 0.4 EiB per day(and rising). https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/netspace

For reference, about 288 Exabytes worth of hard drives were shipped in Q1 2021 https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hdd-shipments-in-q1-2021

Chia network size can be considered a lagging indicator for unexpected drive shipments. Generally, it can take a few weeks between when a drive is purchased and when it's actually accounted for on the network, as it takes time for it to be shipped, set up, and plotted. Chia wasn't even listed on exchanges until a couple weeks ago, so most of the growth seen is prior to Chia even having a price. At current prices, mining is incredibly profitable, with a $500 14 TB drive estimated to produce about $26 per day, and using very little power. So even if the network grows 10x to 60 Exabytes, it's still producing $3/day at current prices. So expect the surge in demand to continue.

I have seen many anecdotes of drive shortages over the past couple weeks. Reviewing sites like Amazon, I have also seen high capacity drives go out of stock or require lead times of a few weeks.

This may be a bit reminiscent of GPU shortages among Nvidia and AMD as miners seek to buy up anything they can.

If we project continued growth at 0.4 Exabytes a day in unexpected demand from proof of storage over the next 40 days, plus the 6 Exabytes added since April 20(leaving out first 3 weeks in quarter as they were likely logged last quarter), that's about 22 Exabytes to be added in Q2 that are not part of normal usage, or about an extra ~8% of Q1 demand.

What's perhaps most interesting is the impact this could have on margins. Unlike the GPUs used to mine which are consumer devices, the devices used for mining Chia includes enterprise grade hardware. Prices in the drive market are more flexible at the manufacturer level, and currently have much lower margins. If proof of storage currencies cause a drive shortage, it could have a significant impact on margins. Western digital sells about 40% of its drives through distributors, Seagate about 30%. Sales through these channels generally are very responsive to demand trends in terms of prices.

Seagate is also in a position to profit from this, but I'm a bit more worried about them as hard drive shipments have been on a long term decline and they aren't diversified into SSDs/flash like Western Digital is.

8159,,2021-05-17 16:06:02,t3_nek6rk,,wallstreetbets,"Hi all, going to keep this short as there is already some great DD on Myovant Sciences out there on Reddit and some recent articles, plus I‚Äôm not a financial advisor.

The EMA (EU medical agency like FDA) announced Myovant and Relugolix as up for review to be accepted for Marketing approval in the EU this week. This is a huge catalyst in the biotech industry, and due to their Pfizer partnership this could result in a 50m cash payment to Myovant as well.

They also have an FDA PDUFA deadline of June 1 for a second application (their first of three was approved in December). If approved this would result in a 100m cash payment from Pfizer.

Alone, these are major catalysts. Right now they stand to go back to back on these catalysts. The last time the company had one catalyst like this, **they were rocketed past $30 a share and gained a strategic partnership from Pfizer.**

Now those are two major catalysts within two weeks, **if FDA decides early, both could happen this week.**

Due to the triple threat data put up in clinical trials and the fact that they had this data peer reviewed and published in the New England journal of medicine, there is strong confidence of approval on the company‚Äôs end.

Last but not least, they have additional catalysts still inbound after. Including Part D and Medicare coverage expected by July 1. All encompassed with a possible buyout from sumitomo.

If you're looking for a good article that covers the basics, you can search the below. Theres also some great posts on reddit and stock twits. I am also happy to answer any questions.

*Why The Misunderstood Pfizer Deal Makes Myovant A Great Low-Risk Investment*

**Quick list of upcoming catalysts:**

THIS WEEK: EMA meets to possibly approve sale of orgovyx in Europe

By June 1: Deadline for FDA approval for a second use case (this could come early and will result in another 100m cash payment from Pfizer)

By July 1: Part d and Medicare coverage: also supposed to be obtained before July 1 for prostate cancer application

Pfizer optionality: Pfizer can opt in to have the rights to sell this in some markets, resulting in a 50m cash payment and royalties paid to myovant. Submission of relugolix for the treatment of endometriosis to the FDA

Catalysts that could happen at any time:  **BUYOUT** from Sumitomo ( aka Sumitovant) or other interested partner (See Urovant history. Sumi has a patent cliff in 2023 they are trying to patch with acquisitions, has purchased 4 of movants sister companies and already owns 53.5% of myovant).

Strategic acquisition of new drug candidates to further myovants pipeline.

**TLDR:**

EU and FDA approvals for drug candidates are expected within the next 2 weeks and could propel this to the moon.

It sounds like an impossibility, but there are simple ways to reading a price chart that enable you to come very close to predicting the direction and turning points of a stock. One of the most important ways is through the identification and marking of channel line patterns.

&#x200B;

[ Prices respect the channel lines ](https://preview.redd.it/fqzpk486qpz61.png?width=1067&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5b02809e77b0f9d4f8162cd558a98154a5aad8e)

Channels lines are one of the most important patterns found on a price chart. They enable you to find the broader trend, or overall direction prices are heading, which is crucial towards choosing the direction of your trade. Sticking with the trend - going long on an uptrend and short on a downtrend - aligns you with the higher probability direction, already setting yourself up for a probable trade.

They also enable you to anticipate and profit from areas where the price has a high likelihood of reversing through a ""bounce"" - where prices hit an upper or lower side of the channel and bounce off of the level like a ball, and heading into the opposite direction. These are key areas because unlike a random point in the chart, a channel line presents a point that has a higher probability of doing one thing over another - *this is an example of where ""edge"" comes from - finding scenarios where one outcome is more likely than the other, and betting on it.*

&#x200B;

[ Channel line pattern with bounces circled ](https://preview.redd.it/f0l668a7qpz61.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=658f753348044acec2cceeaa1dfbf4c6288ae0ff)

## How do you define a channel pattern?

A channel line pattern exists when prices are moving between two parallel trendlines. A trendline is a straight line drawn to connect several major turning points, or swings, in the price chart. When there are two identifiable trendlines that are parallel to each other forming a straight band, prices are *trading within a channel*.

&#x200B;

[ A trendline drawn off of the highs ](https://preview.redd.it/fcfpptc8qpz61.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc81911e78d6e9ee5012760fc53e05f6200513b2)

Trendlines and channels are drawings that highlight the foundational concept of understanding price charts - support and resistance. Support is a level that lies underneath the current price that historically has acted as a cushion for prices, slowing their momentum or causing them to turn right around. Resistance is a level that lies above the current price that historically has acted as a barrier for prices, slowing their momentum or causing a reversal. In this way, support and resistance are one and the same - they are levels that ""support"" or ""resist"", keeping prices within their confines until they lose their power.

&#x200B;

>Prices will often ""test"" support and resistance multiple times and the level will successfully hold, creating areas with a high probability of a bounce - therefore creating trading opportunities.

## How to Draw Channel Lines

So, trendlines connect two or more support or resistance zones, which are areas where prices reversed or showed slowing momentum. Channels are two parallel trendlines. With that, *how can you draw a channel line on a price chart*?

The first consideration is if there is a channel at all. Often, there are ample opportunities to draw trendlines - straight lines connecting s/r. However, it is less often that the chart shows another parallel trendline that price has interacted with. Thus, a textbook ""channel"" with prices neatly filling in the space and bouncing off of the lines is not as easy as it seems to find - **this actually makes the pattern more important, as the discovery of a true channel pattern can lead to very clean bounces and high probability, low risk trades.**

To draw a channel, first find a trendline. Connect important swing lows or highs, and try to find a way to draw a line that connects two or more of the swings, while keeping all of of the other price movement between the swings above the line.

&#x200B;

[ First trendline duplicated and dragged to mark swing lows ](https://preview.redd.it/ss3uggaaqpz61.png?width=561&format=png&auto=webp&s=56e6198235392485a05edaddc3f8d0da4d802d4c)

>A trendline is only as significant as the prices' respect for it - there is no validity to drawing a trendline that connects two swings, while is broken by three other spikes.

Once you've found the trendline, either duplicate the trendline you have just drawn, or if using a channel drawing tool, simply drag the parallel line to see if it can connect two more swings on the opposite side of the price movement.

It takes *a lot* of practice to begin to properly draw channel lines that are valid and are respected by prices. Drawing channel patterns that match historical price charts is hard - and drawing them in a way that can successfully anticipate *future* price movements is even more of a learned skill. This can only be improved by practicing drawing channels on many different charts.

## Types of Channel Lines

The direction of channel lines determine the type of channel pattern. A channel pointed at an upward sloping angle signals an uptrend. A channel pointed at a downward angle signals a downtrend. A channel with a horizontal slope signals a range.

&#x200B;

[ Uptrend ](https://preview.redd.it/s8h4o1xbqpz61.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=1df032e442d4dddf112e30748baedcff16656291)

A concept that is helpful in the identification of a channel's direction is the presence of swing highs and lows. If prices are making higher swings high (peaks) and higher swings low (troughs), chances are they are in an uptrend. If prices are making lower highs and lower lows, they are likely in a downtrend. If there are equal or mismatching swing lows and highs, and prices look more horizontal, a range is likely in play.

&#x200B;

[ Downtrend with channel break ](https://preview.redd.it/wovf3mvcqpz61.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0029bb3d64ea2cb1da1b122a2e477cd0ce827d)

In a trending market, sticking with the direction of the trend can put you on the higher probability side. Combined with an entry identified by the channel lines, this can form the basis of a trading strategy.

In a ranging market, where prices are simply bouncing between two horizontal support and resistance trendlines, any time prices approach or touch the channel lines can be a significant reversal area, where there is a higher probability of a bounce than a breakout through the line.

&#x200B;

[Range](https://preview.redd.it/6z1kj65eqpz61.png?width=1019&format=png&auto=webp&s=3196922b3ddd01cd806ca9f100aa01918bf0b766)

## The Midline and Channel Pattern Breaks

Many channel drawing tools can display a midline, or a line 50% away from both trendlines. This line can serve as an important secondary trendline or support/resistance zone, and often prices react to the midline in a less apparent, but still significant way. Additionally, sometimes prices will break the channel line and form a new high outside of the channel. When this happens, the broken trendline can sometimes become the midline of a wider channel that incorporates the new swing.

&#x200B;

[ Upper channel line turned into midline after breakout ](https://preview.redd.it/wz5gw1peqpz61.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=68d55d124e5799ccc86ac01d5f860786ef24d183)

*When prices break a channel line, it is a sign that the pattern is losing validity.* The trend may be losing steam or accelerating, based on if it breaks the lower or the upper line. A channel line pattern is most valid when there are no price breaks of the trendlines. When prices break the countertrend side (the lower line in an uptrend or the upper line in a downtrend), you can anticipate a reversal soon. When prices break the with-trend side, the trend has accelerated, and you may need to redraw your channel line. This can also be seen as an expenditure of momentum which can bring a trend channel back into a range or a reversal.

## How to Trade With Channel Lines

Because channel line patterns offer areas that have *a higher probability of moving in one direction over the other*, trading strategies can be formed around the pattern. After identifying a valid channel, a strategy may look to buy or sell as price touches the with-trend channel line, setting a stop loss level based on volatility, Fibonacci extensions, or a selection of indicators that can identify momentum and turning points. A take profit level could be determined by a significant support/resistance level, Fibonacci retracements, or indicators similar to those used in stop placement.

&#x200B;

[ A channel bounce trade with \>2:1 risk:reward ](https://preview.redd.it/f24xyxqfqpz61.png?width=1521&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae05a98cdfdfcfb19552fbff3bbb2b5b4331ba7a)

The key advantage to trading channel bounces is the **high risk to reward** offered. A tight stop loss can allow for a high R:R ratio even with a high probability, modest profit target level. Thus, the strategy utilizes *a high probability turning point, a tight stop loss, and a modest profit target* which culminates into a trading plan with a healthy win rate and risk to reward ratio.

Finally, an overlooked aspect of using channels:

&#x200B;

>Channel line patterns have one final key importance to trading - they let you know when to not be in. This helps to reinforce a golden rule of trading - only look to enter trades when there is a higher probability of one thing happening over the other. By watching your channel lines, you'll know when it's there.

&#x200B;

[ Channels force you to be patient and wait for the turning points ](https://preview.redd.it/d3asavogqpz61.png?width=1063&format=png&auto=webp&s=42024fd0d87b9df76edf37e8c33df58b4675684c)

8166,,2021-05-17 17:38:52,t3_nemlpe,,wallstreetbets,"So right now, the mainstream narrative is that inflation is going to run red hot mostly due to a rally in commodity prices. This inflation has the potential to be more than transitory, meaning it lasts more than a couple of quarters at most and will result in forcing the FED to raise rates and crash growth stocks. This is why tech stocks are underperforming while value, or more specifically, manufacturing and mining companies outperform (look at XME for example).

My question is if that is the case, then why are steel futures for U.S. Midwest Domestic Hot-Rolled Coil Steel going down [CME Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/ferrous/hrc-steel_quotes_globex.html)? Right now they peak in June at $1,520 a tonne before steadily going down for the foreseeable future.

Similar things can be said about other commodities such as copper, which remains relatively steady before gradually going down going into next year [Copper Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/base/copper_quotes_globex.html).

On the agriculture side, major commodities like corn appear to be peaking in the near future as well [Corn Futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/grain-and-oilseed/corn_quotes_globex.html).

So taking all of this into account, it would appear that the shape of the futures curves would indicate that commodity prices would peak in near future before gradually going down as supply meets demand. Shouldn't this mean that inflation is indeed transitory as the FED predicts? What am I missing here?

**Tl;Dr:** Futures are showing commodity prices going down in the near future which should drag down inflation rates. Are inflation fears misplaced?",nemlpe,Are Commodity Futures Going Against The Mainstream Inflation Narrative?

Sit back... relax and enjoy.   If you worry in a bull market, I can't even imagine in a bear market! 

Gold & silver's monthly defined 2021 road map still intact.  Q2 and Q4 belong to silver, while gold will shine in Q3. 

Silver's Masterpiece! We already have a yearly confirmed breakout for silver! Now, if you want to play it safe, wait for a 2020 close above 17.15$, then this could very well be the lowest risk, highest reward play of your lifetime!

Silver's open interest (including options) MACD shows an insane setup for silver.

Question is... how high? Greedy analog move yields 73$ in Q4 2021.

Tic toc ?

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and Gold and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

My assumptions : 3% -3.5 %, yields 2,70-3% , USA Growth 5 -6 %  . There is no doomsday or hyperinflation !!!

As stated in my previous post this is not economic boom this is just recovery . 

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term. 

I am an ape as like you , This is not financial advise just my personal targets .

It's no secret that companies hire teams of people to brainstorm, draft, and send tweets, but even with the millions of dollars spent on this process it is rare for corporate twitter accounts to have big spikes in followers. Wendy's can obviously tweet some witty stuff that will get lots of likes and retweets, but this usually doesn't motivate most people to sign up for extra ads on their timeline by actually following these accounts.

Wingstop, however, cracked the code on Wednesday by denying the presence of ejaculate in their special white sauce. On Wednesday, one customer tweeted ""wingstop ranch gotta have nut in it no way it‚Äôs just that good"" to which Wingstop replied ""it's a special white sauce but it does not contain \[nut\]""

The rest of the conversation did not contain any more trade secrets on the Wingstop recipe, but it was notable in its own way.

[Twitter screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/2rmwspravqz61.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=090ca925fe321799a1934ea2edfc746480922449)

I rarely ever see companies with hundreds of thousands of followers (Wingstop has over 200k) receive over a 5% increase in Twitter followers over a week. Wingstop had a 10% gain in a matter of days.

The market seemingly reacted with disappointment to the lack of bodily fluids in the secret recipe as $WING fell 2% in the day following the exchange.",nerobc,"Wingstop ($WING) has 11% growth in Twitter followers, 3% drop in stock price after denying that their special white sauce contains human ejaculate"

8195,,2021-05-17 21:46:48,t3_nesw0u,,wallstreetbets,"Hey Guys, it's me again. I think you guys may remember me, after all I wrote an extensive series of DD over a month on UWMC through its trials and tribulations, in anticipation of it's breakout moment. You might even remember my YOLO, and remembered I continuously added to it. And that I eventually upped my margin to 13.5k on it. Well, I'm here to tell you that I'm not out. I bought more calls to average down, on earnings day, and I held them when they tanked to ten cents a pop. My only regret is that I didn't buy more then. Though I threw a bit more cash into shares!

Back then, I said the Theta Beta's would regret selling those calls, and it was one of the few plays where there wouldn't be IV Crush. I was right. Their probably a little sour. Sorry chaps, you usually are the one's making money at our expense. This time it's going to have to be the other way around....

Today, I had the chance to exit my options for a 47% profit roughly. Sell calls for a chunky profit after that. I said no. You know why? Because fuck the people who shorted an extremely profitable company to 6.26 dollars, that's why. The Fear, the Uncertainty, and the Doubt people expressed to me regarding this company espoused to me because of the actions of those people gave me an aneurysm. So fuck them. We're playing Pac Man people. The CEO of UWMC is reducing the float, and increasing the percentage of the float that is sold short while increasing buying pressure. We're buying up the stock to get the price to 9-10 because people bought options for 5-10 cents and they'll be in the money quite easily. And because of the rising volume, every day the CEO is able to buy more and more shares thanks to Rule 10B. The delta on the options is low, and they will need to hedge as the price heads steadily upward on Friday. Then the Shorts are going to be squeezed even further as the market makers hedge.

So no, I won't sell my options for a 10 or a 50% profit. I'm going to sell my options at a price I damn well want to. One that compensates me for the trouble that these people have given me. And so should you.

I understand people have taken profits, but honestly, at the price point they were selling at the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. Good for them though. Next time, could you at least sell deep ITM covered calls though lmao.

And for those people on the fucking fence. You jumped onto MVIS, you jumped into GME, and AMC, and all manners of companies that are either unprofitable or make very little money. But the fucking BOOMER stock is where you hesitate the fence?! The fucking (Eyy Lmaooo) Boomer stock, giving you a 4.87% dividend? The one that, if you somehow baghold can give you 10-15% cash returns through divitendies and covered calls until you get assigned at a strike that is profitable to you? The 10-15% backboard cash that can fund all your yolo's? That's the fucking stock you hesitate on? El LMAO. The companies margins will expand hard in a few months, and it's still hugely profitable at a less than 1 percent margin so yeah. Now if you were buying at 14 fucking bucks, you're a dumb ape, but yeah.

I'm fucking going to ride my options to a fucking profit margin that compensates me for the shit they pulled, or to a GUH. No in between. The Stock Buyback middle finger is just the fucking sweetener.

Matt Daddy, and I, and all the people who everyone called bag holders are going to skull fuck the shorters harder than they skull fucked UWMC's share price. They're going to fucking Guh their way into a fucking shoebox. Fuck em. I want me tendies well cooked, a side of fries, and a foot massage. And their going to give it to me. And to all of you who bought, and are buying UWMC.

The setup is a symmetrical triangle. Normally when continuation patterns come from downside - they have a bearish bias. However - we broke that red trendline  with an uptick in volume - this was a hint we were ready for an actual reversal. That trendline kept us in a downtrend for about 4 months. Not only that but...

**TODAY WE BROKE THE SYMMETRICAL TRIANGLE UP - WHICH MEANS ITS FULL SPEED AHEAD!**

Confluence between technicals generate the best signals.

This is the best the setup has looked since GME was at 10. Price target for this is 231.52 resistance initially, followed by 348.50. Breakout is invalid and play is dead if we get a daily close back under 158.11.

And... that's it.

I've been trading for a long time and only use patterns, trendlines & volume. Keep it simple. You don't need to waste 100 hours doing 15 paragraphs of DD for one swing trade - or look at 100 different indicators cherry picking the ones that say your position will go up.

***TL;DR*** \- GME actually looks good for once from an **unbiased** technical standpoint

***EDIT:*** Clarification - I wasn't speaking for GME as a whole when I said it was dead under 158.11 - I simply meant this setup in particular was no longer valid. It could always form a new one.

$CNK is AMCs largest competitor and is in the great business we know as movie theaters. When AMC last went crazy, CNK ran up over 56% in a few days from 22-27 of January to $27+. In the past month, AMC is up over 50%. CNK is roughly even. It is lagging behind and is due for a major pop on this AMC craze. It is a classically more boring stock that takes a big nudge to move.

Breaking out similar to AMC. Insanely strong volume shelf in low 20s (high demand) and above 1D 21MA. RSI has lots of room to run. 

**MARGIN**

CNK has a much lower implied volatility and actually allows for margin borrowing. This could be attractive depending on your risk appetite

**DILUTION/FINANCIALS**

CNK has almost no share dilution since the pandemic started, and it has been historically stronger than AMC from a traditional (retarded) financial perspective. AMCs market value growth has passed CNKs by many multiples over the past year. No reason she can't get some love.

A put is an option (financial product) associated with a stock (TSLA in this case) where the value goes up if the associated stock goes down.

This is because the put gives you the right to sell the stock at the agreed strike price (specified at put purchase time). So if you buy a put at the current stock price, and the stock price goes down, you have the right to sell the stock at a higher price than current market value, giving the put its value.

There are a lot of subtleties to this but the basics is: stock go down, put go up.",,

I strongly suggest you stop investing. You seriously have a problem and you don't seem to want to stop. It's not healthy to gamble your student loans to try and be that 1 in 1,000 success story. 

Get your ass back in school and study for the sake of your family. You said you care about your family then start acting like it and study so you can at least pay the minimum on those loans and provide even a little bit for your family. 

Not going back? Get yourself in a trade school. Faster and make decent amount of money.

Not interested in going back to school, a trade, or stopping yourself from investing money that technically is not even yours? Then distance yourself from your family. If you can't help them by helping yourself then you need to distance yourself from them until you can get some professional help. 

Make sure your family has someplace to stay where they can be okay for the time being and fix yourself for their sake.",,

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

&nbsp;

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

&nbsp;

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, and checking out my socials, it would mean a lot to me! **Happy Trading Everybody! :)**",ne1fla,"Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation (Week 5) - $HD, $WMT, $TGT, $LOW, $CSCO, $GOEV, $XL, $SE and More"

So let's say you're in a country with financial issues like Nigeria and you need to send money to China. All you do is swap your Naira to ZINA and then swap your ZINA to CNY and withdraw to a CNY account.

The project also seeks to bring 1B people into the blockchain by taking it offline. It's building a paper wallet system, so people can use it as cash, spend on micro purchases and withdraw in cash at ATMs.

It has a 100Billion maximum supply and will be burning 5B at each 1000 Wallet Address holders, till it reaches 50B tokens burnt. 

Here's the contract address. It's currently trading on PancakeSwap and yesterday ran 535%. 

0x76beed9649c0c297cb6de10d07efd66db38e3c47

Moreover this is far from the first time the stock market has seen a bubble. By this logic we had hyperinflation in the '01(With a normal 2.8% inflation rate) tech bubble and the '08 housing bubble(3.8%). Both markets crashed from their highs and we did not see the price of commodities go up with their insanity then either.

Housing is particularly scary as it's simply prices being bid up at auction by an increased supply of buyers due to low mortgage rates and down payments required being as low as 5%. This is unlikely to persist much past COVID and people paying 30% over ask for homes right now have a high likelihood of being fucked once things go back to normal. It'll be short of a housing crisis most likely as there's no evidence that bad loans are being shit out but there's very little chance that the volatile gains we've seen this year are going to be maintained IMO.

In short, believe the 4% inflation numbers. There's no reason to disbelieve them. You are not paying 30% increased prices on commodities like rice, milk, water, or meats which have remained pretty stable over the last year(Outside of again situations like the housing market where temporary external sources like meat shortages temporarily jack up prices), and housing is unlikely to stay as insane as it is.",,

His $TSLA puts are generating the most interest from the media, but the position that stuck out most to me is his puts on $TLT, the 20-year treasury bond etf. It makes sense, if inflation really is upon us, the fed will have to raise rates soon. Higher rates = lower price per bond = lower $TLT. This seems way too intuitive and I feel like an idiot for not thinking of it a month ago, but obviously that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not Dr. Burry. I‚Äôm sure he got in a while ago and is already up a bunch of money, but I feel like there are still gains to be made in this trade in the months ahead.

The reason I‚Äôm posting is that $TLT has already come down a fair amount in the past month, but this still seems like an easy money play on inflation. Is there something I‚Äôm missing or is it really that simple? The 13F for Scion Asset Management doesn‚Äôt detail the strike price or expiration for the puts, but I‚Äôm thinking about going in for a few 1/21/22 $125 puts on $TLT. The fed claims this inflation is transitory, but I don‚Äôt think anyone on the street buys it. I think rates have to come up at least a little bit sometime between now and next January.

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, and checking out my socials, it would mean a lot to me! **Happy Trading Everybody! :)**",ne1fla,"Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation (Week 5) - $HD, $WMT, $TGT, $LOW, $CSCO, $GOEV, $XL, $SE and More"

[**Anders Bylund**](https://boards.fool.com/profile/TMFZahrim/info.aspx) **(Nokia):** Few tech stocks have weathered the recent market storm quite like Finnish telecom infrastructure veteran Nokia. The stock has gained 32% since the New Year, including a 14% jump over the last 30 days. By contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is trading flat in 2021 and fell 7% in the last month.

This stock may feel like a joke due to the recent influx of Nokia interest from the Reddit-based WallStreetBets group, but that's just a coincidence. Nokia's real-world business prospects are solid and the stock is actually undervalued, even though it dodged the tech-stock market correction in recent months.

Nokia's solid market position was built on a foundation of [5G network](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) installations. Top-line sales are rising faster than expected, Nokia's profit margin is expanding as we speak thanks to the richer product mix, and the stock is changing hands for less than eight times free cash flow. You don't see that combination of deep-discount stock prices and robust business trends very often, and that makes Nokia a no-brainer buy right now.",ne3k42,Nokia an industry leader in the bargain bin

Home Depot reports earnings premarket 5/18. HD has beat earnings consistently and the share price has reacted negatively each time. In this market I feel like the play here is a strangle. My proposed play is the closest to the money strikes. Right now based on $324 list that would be the 5/21 323.5P/325C. You are in for about $1k. Break even is 3% in either direction. Of course we are hoping for 6% at least.

November earnings was a beat and the stock dropped 6% that day. That would be 100% profit with the trade I propose for educational purposes only. The previous report had a -3.2% drop that day which would still print.

Here is the kicker. The 5 day high is $344 (5/10) and low $317 (5/12) for a 2 day swing of 8.4% bases on Friday close. This is key because it means there is the potential for both sides of the strangle to be profitable prior to expiration! Nuts right?

Here is how to play it. Watch the housing report tomorrow (5/17). With lumber prices being insane new construction might be a miss. If HD stock goes down you will need to consider if the market will price this in when digesting an earnings miss. You will want to wait until the end of the day to enter the strangle to make sure you have strikes that put the Monday close in the middle.

If earnings are a beat and the prices goes up >3% sell the call once you are happy with the profit. Lock in your tuition money because again, this is for education. Same goes for the inverse. Then you have until Friday to try to get tendies with the other side. Can't remember the Vince Vaughn line from Dodge ball but it think it's ""that's what we call the jackpot"".

Not WSB material you say? Earnings plays are inherently gambling and sir, this is a casino.

Positions: none yet. Ask me at 3PM tomorrow you illiterate ape.

TLDR: Home Depot is usually located in  very close proximity to a Wendy's = tendies.

GME is trading at $180 right now.  Fair value is probably in a range of $40 - $200 given the publicly available information. The strategic new hires, retirement of all debt and recent raising of $500M in capital lean it towards the top end of that estimate for me. This info is all fairly new.  Some investors are buying with the expectation that new information will be released that will show a higher value for the stock like eSports, Build a Gaming PC etc.  Some may be over estimating the impact, others are under estimating.  

Pricing on securities is very dynamic and is impacted not just by the info around a stock but also large macro events and alternative suitable investments. I think Burry under estimated the price of GME and is likely over estimating how far Tsla will drop.  My guess is it will find a bottom and then proceed to rip upward and trim his unrealized profits pretty quickly.

[**Anders Bylund**](https://boards.fool.com/profile/TMFZahrim/info.aspx) **(Nokia):** Few tech stocks have weathered the recent market storm quite like Finnish telecom infrastructure veteran Nokia. The stock has gained 32% since the New Year, including a 14% jump over the last 30 days. By contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is trading flat in 2021 and fell 7% in the last month.

This stock may feel like a joke due to the recent influx of Nokia interest from the Reddit-based WallStreetBets group, but that's just a coincidence. Nokia's real-world business prospects are solid and the stock is actually undervalued, even though it dodged the tech-stock market correction in recent months.

Nokia's solid market position was built on a foundation of [5G network](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) installations. Top-line sales are rising faster than expected, Nokia's profit margin is expanding as we speak thanks to the richer product mix, and the stock is changing hands for less than eight times free cash flow. You don't see that combination of deep-discount stock prices and robust business trends very often, and that makes Nokia a no-brainer buy right now.",ne3k42,Nokia an industry leader in the bargain bin

Home Depot reports earnings premarket 5/18. HD has beat earnings consistently and the share price has reacted negatively each time. In this market I feel like the play here is a strangle. My proposed play is the closest to the money strikes. Right now based on $324 list that would be the 5/21 323.5P/325C. You are in for about $1k. Break even is 3% in either direction. Of course we are hoping for 6% at least.

November earnings was a beat and the stock dropped 6% that day. That would be 100% profit with the trade I propose for educational purposes only. The previous report had a -3.2% drop that day which would still print.

Here is the kicker. The 5 day high is $344 (5/10) and low $317 (5/12) for a 2 day swing of 8.4% bases on Friday close. This is key because it means there is the potential for both sides of the strangle to be profitable prior to expiration! Nuts right?

Here is how to play it. Watch the housing report tomorrow (5/17). With lumber prices being insane new construction might be a miss. If HD stock goes down you will need to consider if the market will price this in when digesting an earnings miss. You will want to wait until the end of the day to enter the strangle to make sure you have strikes that put the Monday close in the middle.

If earnings are a beat and the prices goes up >3% sell the call once you are happy with the profit. Lock in your tuition money because again, this is for education. Same goes for the inverse. Then you have until Friday to try to get tendies with the other side. Can't remember the Vince Vaughn line from Dodge ball but it think it's ""that's what we call the jackpot"".

Not WSB material you say? Earnings plays are inherently gambling and sir, this is a casino.

Positions: none yet. Ask me at 3PM tomorrow you illiterate ape.

TLDR: Home Depot is usually located in  very close proximity to a Wendy's = tendies.

Friday, I decided to load up on 1-2 week out OTM calls (at strikes probably around 10%-30% above the current market value). I‚Äôll be throwing a couple grand a week at this trade til it hits! 

MGM, NCLH, BA, BP are my picks. Each from a different industry, positively impacted by the reopening and ensuing pent-up demand of the economy. I‚Äôm swinging for the MIL on this! 

I‚Äôm a bull here for technical reasons. However, the fundamentals make sense here now as well. The current bull-market trendlines on all the reopen stonks started with a vaccine announcement on November 9th in the early A.M. (the freaking insiders bought/drove up prices before the market opened, that sucked).

The CDC letting ‚Äúvaccinated‚Äù people stop social distancing has majorly positive implications for the economy. Think of traveling, think of the impeding Memorial Day weekend...

Go check out the 1-year, 1-day charts for these stocks, and draw a line from the close on November 6th to now. I think we see 30% or more gains in the value of these stocks the next couple weeks.

I  have shared my thoughts on UWMC in past. The company announced Q1  earnings and while they look like they are below expectations it was  explained by the CEO that because of the speed of their execution, their  results are reflective of the higher rate environment already while  competitors are lagged.

During    the Q4 2020 earnings call he  had mused about options that would be on    the stable, special dividend,  buyback or raising the dividend.

**Feb Q4 Earnings Quote:**

The     Board did approve a dividend, a $0.10 quarterly dividend to be  paid    on  April 6 for all shareholders of record as of March 10. **We expect  this to be a regular quarterly dividend**.

And     so you guys know how we're thinking about this. Our balance sheet   is  a   fortress. And our current liquidity position is very strong, and    we   have access to the capital markets as well. The way we think  about   this   going forward is we're producing a lot of cash. We're  going to   maybe   be more profitable than some expected and be very  successful in   2021.   And **if we have excess cash that I and the Board deem is too much,  we will be delivering that back**. And whether we have to **change     the  dividend in the future, as in raise it or a special dividend,     those  things are definitely on the table or even buying back shares**.

**May Q1 Earnings Quote:**

As     you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of      $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a      record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I always  **explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special  dividend or a share buyback program**. As you guys have seen, we **concluded      share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward   shareholders.    We announced the authorization of $300 million share   buyback over the    next 24 months**.  And **quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that**.

**Then in answering a question from an analyst**

Doug    Harter -  Great. And then just in terms of capital return, you    mentioned sort of  the float. I  guess just how are you thinking about    kind of **how much of  the float  you'd be willing to take out and pacing around share  repurchase**?

Mat Ishbia -  Yes, Doug. So I'm learning these rules as we go **because at this stock  price, I'm a buyer, right**?    And so we'll buy shares as soon as tomorrow, I  think, as our legal    teams say we're allowed to do. And so I don't know  how many I can buy    and what I can do, but I'm very conscientious of the  float.  If the    float was not a concern, **we'd be more aggressive**. However,  **we     have authorization from the Board to buy up to $300 million, and I'm      going to take advantage of that opportunity while being  conscientious     of our partners in the float.**

TL/DR:     UWMC and their board have been looking at ways to give back to     shareholders. Instead of a short term cash out, they decided on a     buyback that they are planning to exercise immediately on so that they     can retire shares while the SP is low. They will NOT buy so much that   it   will ruin their float % for Russell. The CEO is aggressive, has    approval to spend $300 and he's going to take FULL advantage.  The CEO has stated he is a BUYER! They are  not   waiting, it's being deployed now.

Disclosure I am still in long position with 25K  at 8.39 USD shares of UWMC
