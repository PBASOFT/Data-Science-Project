14,gywstt0,2021-05-21 04:58:25,t1_gywstt0,t1_gyt0icq,pennystocks,"1. ""**Also I wonder how difficult it is to prepare these drugs....""**

TK216 is administered via IV and the current recommended dosage is for a period of 14 days. This still beats the current standard of care which is chemotherapy combined with invasive surgical procedures with some patients even **having entire limbs cut off** to minimize metastasis. Again, I can't stress how pitiful current treatments are for ES and TK216 beats them both in terms of efficacy, safety, and dosage form.

1. ""**The TK drug wasn't doing well in the data until cohort 9....""**

There were 9 escalation cohorts from 18-288 mg/m2/day.  Dosages used in the other cohorts were exploratory in nature and it was only the 9th and expansion cohort that used the current recommended phase 2 dose of 200mg/m2/day. 

1. **""I've seen drugs like Lartruvo get fast tracked...then fail in the macro data....""**

Fair point but the same can be said about every single clinical trial in existence, so it's not an argument unique to ONCT per se. This risk is the name of the game in the biotech/pharma industry. I still find it very promising that there are 2 sustained complete responses, one for over 2 years and the other for over a year. No ES intervention that I know of has reported this kind of data. 

1. **""ROR sounds like a good new target to try, but I've seen other targets like hedgehog fail when you use more patients.""**

Agreed! ROR1 is a great target due to its specificity and safety profile. Can't say much about using more patients since that will just come later but cirmtuzumab beats hedge inhibitors when it comes to safety. There are 3 approved hedgehog inhibitors: ATO, Vismodegib, and Sonidegib. A quick glance at each of its safety profile will show that cirmtuzumab (as of now) offers a promising combination of efficacy and safety. Then again, we're talking about 2 entirely different set of drugs for 2 entirely different set of indications so this really is comparing apples to oranges at this point.",,

This capital would definitely be enough to cover any short term debt obligations. Also it should be mentioned that the stockholder equity was last reported to be around 200 million which is basically double what the current market cap is, kind of signals that even on paper the stock is undervalued. After a good amount of this debt clears up it will also lessen the very high interest expenses they’ve been paying which has been the main cause of them losing profits since their income from operations has been at a respectable level.

I have been doing this for 4 years now, and I have made plan designs for complete fibre optic GPON networks supplying over 25000 buildings with high speed connections. My company is gigantic in comparison to iQSTEL. We have over 8000 employees and only a small part of the company is publicly traded.

And I am super bullish on iQSTEL. I don't own a single stock in my company. I love it, but I don't see a big growth potential as such large companies need to disrupt an industry to see big growth. iQSTEL on the other hand, is tiny and a little baby in the stock market. They will grow fast with new acquisitions, and their aqcuisitions are working on products in almost exclusively futuristic market segments.

Some of the fields are the fields they in:

\- 5G Telecom solutions: 5G is going to be so big, so soon, that it's hard to imagine. 5G networks needs alot more mobile sites (antennas) per square kilometer than 4G. And each 5G site needs a fibre connection. This means that companies need to hire and produce alot more fibre optic connections and mobile sites per customer than ever before. This translates into much more employees, more revenue, bigger EPS.

\- IoT, connected devices

\- Battery and EV technologies

\- FinTech: Automation and enhancement of financial processes

\- Blockchain technology

My company have already installed several 5G test sites in several countries. Some of which we were the very first to do it. But let me tell you, we do NOT have enough people with the expertise needed to start large scale installations of 5G. No one has, because it's so new. Companies need to hire engineers and create knowledge down the ladder for years before every major telecom contractor can serve large scale installation operations.

This is so important for iQSTEL that it's hard to describe. All the worlds large telecom providers are in such a hurry to install 5G and be the first to get market domination, that they will hire absolutely any contractor to do it as long as they know how to. This means that an equal amount of business could go to small companies such as iQSTEL as they can to large companies like mine. If my company in 2021 only have the capacity to install 75 mobile sites, and the telecom provider wants to install 1000 of them, they will buy these services from all other companies too. Only to be first to market domination.

So believe me when I say, that iQSTEL will have an unrealistic growth, because they are perfectly positioned as a small company in a completely new market with diabolically big players that want rapid expansion.

But why would iQSTEL be able to compete with big contractors? Won't the big contractors get the best engineers putting iQSTEL at a loss of manpower and competence pools? No. Big contractors like my company have insane overhead costs. In some areas we have to have at least 15% profit on big projects just to pay the overhead costs when the money is lifted upwards. Remember, we have big HR departments, accountants, lawyers, account managers and many more. Small companies rarely have such overhead costs and can therefore provide bigger paychecks than the large companies can.

So if iQSTEL want to hire they can tempt future employees with bigger paychecks. They can also tempt them with their tiny size. Just think of how many people who hates the machine, the system, the big corps etc. Even with the same pay, I think most people would prefer to work in a smaller and more down to earth environment than in large corporate environments with giant pyramids of management and leadship teams.

On a final note, I hope iQSTEL will drop even more in price and stay low for another few months. Every surplus dollar from my pay each month, and every bitcoin amount I get from mining will go to loading up more iQST stocks.

I believe that every stock of IQST you buy today, will have a major impact on you economy in a few years time. I plan on living lean as hell and just buying more until the price starts to climb. A bull run WILL come, as it allways do after a bear cycle. And when that bull run starts, you will want to have as many shares as you possibly can!

TL;DR: iQSTEL is positioned perfectly in a new and GIGANTIC market, and stands to have godlike increases in revenue and growth in the next few years. Buy IQST now while you still can. This ride is going to be in a steep hill upwards!",nhna3e,"$IQST, and why you should buy it now! (not DD, but insight into 5G and their position in the market)"

[https://clients3.weblink.com.au/pdf/88E/02376906.pdf](https://clients3.weblink.com.au/pdf/88E/02376906.pdf)

Pantheon will be releasing resource updates on these two zones in the coming weeks. However, Pantheon did release a 2C contingent resource update on the Basin Floor Fan complex (now called Theta West) of 1.41 billion barrels recoverable.

Although the SMD and SFS are not expected to be quite as large, this still suggests significant discovered oil in the $EEENF acreage where they currently hold a 75% working interest. This provides a catalyst for stock price appreciation before 88E is able to return to the Merlin prospect next winter and could be more net barrels than Merlin.

To get an idea of how optimistic Pantheon management are, they did a round of media interviews yesterday:

[https://youtu.be/N7Iq08Rr6-o](https://youtu.be/N7Iq08Rr6-o)

Both $EEENF and $PTHRF (on the London market, 88E and PANR) seem worth a look…

=======

To see how contingent resources relate to reserves, see below:

The process of reserves recognition is a three step process:

1. Do you have legal title to the resource?

2. What is the volume that would be expected to be recovered with reasonable certainty?

3. Does the recovery of the expected volumes exceed the commerciality threshold?

==========

TLDR shortcut

Many people read Contingent Resources as being “uncommercial” but this is not what the term means. The proximity to infrastructure means that Pantheon’s Alkaid Contingent Resources exceed the commerciality threshold, but they have not received field development approval nor demonstrated the financial resources to develop Alkaid or the various Talitha discoveries (including the Theta West Project). This precludes their classification as Proved Reserves.

Since LKA has only classified a 76.5 Mbbl of the total Alkaid discovery (estimated to be potentially 300 Mbbl+ when including volumes under closure but down dip of the current “Lowest Known Oil”) as Contingent Resources there is appreciable upside above their current level. This means that the volumetric risk (i.e. that ultimate recovery will be less than is classified as Contingent Resources) could well be lower than for a Discovered Resource of 76.5 Mbbl all of which was classified as Proved Reserves

==========

**STEP 1**

In the case of Pantheon’s Alaskan assets, we can deal with the first step easily enough - either they own what they have been disclosing to the market or the directors are going to jail. This would clearly be something to be confirmed by due diligence on behalf of a potential buyer but the odds must be that they have legal title to the leases. In addition, due diligence would limit the volumetric assessment to only those parts of the accumulations that underlie the Pantheon leases.

**STEP 3**

We will return to step 2 (volumetric analysis) and address step 3 next because I believe this forms the crux of the question about how the certainty of Pantheon’s Contingent Resources estimate relates to Proved Reserves. The following passage is taken from the 2018 update to the SPE PRMS^(\*). ***The Bold Italic comments, links and figures are my commentary and are intended to help understand how each element of the SPE definition applies to Pantheon’s Alkaid unit based on the LKA assessment (and now the Theta West Project subject to independent audit of the company’s numbers)***:

=====

Discovered recoverable quantities (Contingent Resources) may be considered commercially mature, and thus attain Reserves classification, if the entity claiming commerciality has demonstrated a firm intention to proceed with development. This means the entity has satisfied the internal decision criteria (typically rate of return at or above the weighted average cost-of-capital or the hurdle rate). Commerciality is achieved with the entity’s commitment to the project and all of the following criteria:

A. Evidence of a technically mature, feasible development plan.

***Pantheon and LKA developed capital and operating cost estimates based on drilling horizontal wells from several pads adjacent to or near the Dalton Highway.***

***See the figure below taken from page 12 of***

[***http://pantheonresources.com/investors/presentations/645-investor-presentation-january-2020/file#page42***](http://pantheonresources.com/investors/presentations/645-investor-presentation-january-2020/file#page42)

B. Evidence of financial appropriations either being in place or having a high likelihood of being secured to implement the project.

***Securing this funding it the reason for the farm out (or other funding approach mentioned by the company). Regardless of the certainty of volumetric estimates, the Contingent Resources could not be considered Reserves unless funding has been secured.***

C. Evidence to support a reasonable time-frame for development.

***Pantheon has secured approval for year round operations from a well pad adjacent to the Dalton Highway (southern site on the figure above). This would allow development to begin with the Alkaid 2 well planned for summer 2021 (subject to timing of funding). Pantheon has also sourced the Modular Arctic Production System (MAPS), a system of leased units that can be scaled in increments of 5,000 bopd which further reduce the capital sink ahead of first production for 30,000 bopd development case. See the figure below taken from page 18 of*** [***http://pantheonresources.com/investors/presentations/653-pantheon-oct-2020-webinar-1/file***](http://pantheonresources.com/investors/presentations/653-pantheon-oct-2020-webinar-1/file)***. The SMD project analysis is actually the Talitha SMD Prospective Resource so do not be confused by the reference to the $2.7 billion NPV10. The point is to illustrate the use of MAPS and what it is:***

[Cashflow Model by LKA for 300 Mbbl SMD Development](https://preview.redd.it/lgrg5cpx5g071.jpg?width=2658&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fabadcaa77f4a1aaa97e9d15d239cf4304db488b)

D. A reasonable assessment that the development projects will have positive economics and meet defined investment and operating criteria. This assessment is performed on the estimated entitlement forecast quantities and associated cash flow on which the investment decision is made (see Section 3.1.1, Net Cash-Flow Evaluation).

***LKA’s report shows an NPV of $595 million prior to incorporation of the lower drilling costs demonstrated in the Talitha well in 2021. This would improve the economics by approximately $200 million. See the figure below taken from page 6 of*** [***http://pantheonresources.com/investors/presentations/659-investor-presentation-april-2021/file#page42:***](http://pantheonresources.com/investors/presentations/659-investor-presentation-april-2021/file#page42:)

E. A reasonable expectation that there will be a market for forecast sales quantities of the production required to justify development. There should also be similar confidence that all produced streams (e.g., oil, gas, water, CO2) can be sold, stored, re-injected, or otherwise appropriately disposed.

***Development plans include water injection and gas re-injection to maintain reservoir pressure. The globally traded market for crude oil means that each cargo of ANS blend crude can be sold individually or a long term offtake agreement secured if this is more advantageous for Pantheon.***

F. Evidence that the necessary production and transportation facilities are available or can be made available.

***The TransAlaska Pipeline System (TAPS) has approximately 1.5 million barrels of oil per day (Mbopd) of spare capacity and, even with the Willow and Pikka developments, the spare capacity after 2025 will still exceed 1 Mbopd. Pantheon has discussed with the TAPS operator and developed an engineering plan for a hot tap directly into the TAPS line. In the early stages before volumes have ramped up to justify this expenditure, crude oil will be trucked to Deadhorse for injection into the system at TAPS pump station #1. The figure below taken from page 4 of*** [***http://pantheonresources.com/investors/presentations/659-investor-presentation-april-2021/file#page42***](http://pantheonresources.com/investors/presentations/659-investor-presentation-april-2021/file#page42) ***demonstrates the proximity of Alkaid (and Talitha) to the TAPS line and the Dalton Highway compared to Willow and Pikka/Horseshoe:***

[Alkaid and Talitha lie alongside the Dalton Highway and TAPS Line. By contrast, Pikka\/Horse and Willow will enter through the Kuparuk River facilities and are some 40 and 80 miles respectively from pipeline entry point](https://preview.redd.it/4f3ffddi6g071.jpg?width=2664&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b3182a345900602bd8e9e9b34527687723ab0aab)

G. Evidence that legal, contractual, environmental, regulatory, and government approvals are in place or will be forthcoming, together with resolving any social and economic concerns.

***In ongoing discussions with the State of Alaska (SoA), Pantheon has been granted production units over the Alkaid and Talitha discoveries. Furthermore, all operations lie within SoA lands and are very close to existing road and pipeline infrastructure. Since the environmental footprint is lower than other developments that are currently being given the go ahead by the SoA, it is reasonable for Pantheon to expect that all necessary approvals will be forthcoming.***

**STEP 2**

Like any of us, I have not seen the full LKA reports for either the Alkaid Discovery or Talitha Shelf Margin Deltaic accumulations. In the case of Talitha, they attributed Prospective Resources pending confirmation from the Talitha well of some 300 Mbbl which would be valued at $2.7 billion. LKA attributed 76.5 Mbbl of Contingent Resources to the Alkaid Anomaly. I think that this consisted of 54 Mbbl of C1 resource and 45 Mbbl of C2 resource to which they attached a 50% risk bringing the total 1C resource to 76.5 Mbbl but it would need to be confirmed - see figure below for the SPE PRMS framework illustration:

[2018 SPE PRMS Illustration](https://preview.redd.it/am21gc8w6g071.jpg?width=2337&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8c6035a752c48e91ac88ac61c9b916e7e9d0acb3)

To help interpret the figure, the horizontal axis is uncertainty and P1 Proved Reserves are the same thing as the 1P estimate. P2 is the probable component and 2P reserves are the sum of P1 and P2 - i.e. Proved + Probable. In terms of the vertical access (risk), the 2018 update of the PRMS uses an illustration to clarify:

[Note the potential ambiguity of “Development Pending” vs “Justified for Development”.](https://preview.redd.it/5xxowb8w6g071.jpg?width=2732&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=13bc1730d203f6ed06b8030aa50818ca771d1b46)

Subject to funding being available, under the 2001 version of the PRMS, the Alkaid unit contingent resources may well have been classified as proved reserves but, in my view, this is precluded by the 2018 PRMS and the 2011 Guidance. The confusion that arose from the fall out of Shell’s reserves incident under the 2001 Guidance was the treatment of “Planned for Development” quantities as “Reserves” and was the subject of a furious exchange between ExxonMobil and Total with the SEC. It revolved around the framework for when resources transitioned from “Development Pending” to “Planned for Development” (now described as “Justified for Development” as shown above) and the companies argued that they should tie classification to the capital spending plans to avoid mis-matches where capex is being directed to resources that have not yet been booked.

The 2001 SPE Guidance document used the illustration below:

[The 2001 Guidance differed in its use of the term “Planned for Development”](https://preview.redd.it/3fj7ha8w6g071.jpg?width=2018&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=abdfaa5a1808e1c35650ab96b8b48b2def514201)

Volumetric Certainty – Kashagan Reserve Booking Example

Contingent Resources volumetrics can have the same certainty as Proved Reserves but there are stage gates that must be passed to transition to the reserves category. Back in 2004, when the Shell reserves incident happened, the main focus was around their having prematurely booked reserves in the Gorgon Field (a major LNG development on Australia’s North West Shelf). In addition, the other major resource that Shell ‘de-booked’ was the Kashagan field in Kazakhstan - other field partners included ExxonMobil and Total, neither of whom de-booked their share of the Kashagan reserves even after Shell had done so. The attached SEC comment letter addresses the question which was whether, despite the companies having committed to proceed, the Kazakh Government had given its final approval.

[https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-29-07/s72907-9.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-29-07/s72907-9.pdf) Beginning at the bottom of page 13, the question of ‘reasonable certainty’ being unreasonably upgraded to a standard of ‘absolute certainty’ is addressed and then, on page 14, the Kashagan example is explained. In terms of the value attributable to the asset, can we say that the distinction between booking it as reserves vs contingent resources was material?

The answer is probably not because there was no change in the quantities to be produced and all parties expected the Kazakh government (including the Kazakh government itself) to grant development consent. The main impact of whether the accumulation was treated as reserves would be in the P&L of the WIOs (because it would determine whether the DD&A calculation included the volumes and costs of Kashagan) and it would affect the metrics for the ‘standardized measure’ (the NPV10 at year end prices) and thence the reserve replacement ratios. It is unclear how much weight investors give to changes in the standardized measure for a major oil company where forward earnings and cashflow expectations seems to be more important.

**An Illustration**

Let us consider a case of a prospect with an expected ultimate recovery (EUR) of 1 billion barrels (bbl) sitting adjacent to infrastructure so that even 50 million barrels would be commercially viable. The 1 billion bbl is arrived at by multiplying the oil initially in place (OIIP) by the recovery factor (RF).

Typically, primary recovery factors will be 7-10% when there is no natural aquifer supporting the pressure in the reservoir. A natural aquifer drive can raise this figure to 15-20% (sometimes more) and then secondary recovery techniques such as water flooding, gas injection, artificial lift etc. can raise the recovery to 40% and higher. If the 1 billion bbl EUR were based on secondary recovery leading to a 40% RF, this would imply that the OIIP was 2.5 billion bbl.

Prior to drilling, that quantity would be considered a ‘prospective resource’. It is likely the 1U quantity would be 250 Mbbl (based on primary recovery) and the 2U estimate would be 1 billion bbl. Following successful discovery, it would become a “known accumulation” and at least some portion could be considered a contingent resource. But how much?

· If evaluation of the well result confirmed exactly the pre-drill expectation and there were enough supporting evidence (such as 3D seismic and perhaps additional historical well penetrations), theoretically the 2C estimate would include the entire 1 billion barrels and the 1C estimate might be 250 Mbbl.

· An alternative, however, is that only a portion of the overall prospect would be considered to be proven to be oil bearing and so the quantity recoverable with reasonable certainty if development were to proceed might be only 100 Mbbl at the 1C level and perhaps 400 Mbbl at the 2C level. The remainder would still be considered prospective resources until it had been penetrated by an appraisal well.

So the reason that less than 1 billion bbl would be considered to be contingent resources could be one or a combination of the following reasons:

* The proportion of the mapped closure that was connected to the discovery well was less than the total area under the closure
* The RF applied to the contingent resource was based on primary recovery only until secondary recovery had been demonstrated to work
* Some portion of the accumulation was not accessible for development drilling without specific permits that might be hard to come by (eg the accumulation crossed into environmentally sensitive wilderness closed to industry)
* Some part of the accumulation was under land that was not yet leased or that was leased to a third party (but that party had not yet proven the extension into their leases)

While only 100 million bbl of the 1 billion bbl EUR is classified as contingent resources, in this example, this is more than the commercial threshold. However, if the working interest owner (WIO) were to commit to develop the accumulation and possessed the financial resources to proceed and had the main discretionary regulatory approvals in hand, that 100 million bbl would be considered reserves rather than contingent resources. It could actually carry less economic risk than a volume of 100 Mbbl representing the total EUR of a prospect rather than 1/10th of the EUR that has a further 900 Mbbl backing it up.

Ask yourself whether you would rather own 100 Mbbl of proved reserves or 100 Mbbl of contingent resources that could, with some further expenditure become proved reserves of 1 billion bbl?",nhozyt,$EEENF and $PTHRF due diligence following recent announcements

Doubtless they will tell us soon. As for Umiat, they are saying the have 2P and 3P reserves but this is not a correct reflection of the SPE PRMS they claim to have applied. They have already said that Umiat is not commercially viable unless other finds at Peregrine are a success to it should be Contingent Resources but then Dave Wall was never one to let definitions get in the way.

Earnings posted positive revenue YoY and a lower liabilities and higher assets, however they are still negative. I believe by next ER this will be a big play and so I changed my mind. I don't need the short term play here anymore, I want to get in early and hold long while the price is small for the beeeg gains.

That's certainly good news for $GVSI. But this is something which GS could control the timing of; he could have paid the TA tomorrow or in a week from now – there's really no rush. But in a few hours GS has a hearing to convince a judge that $RETC is better off in his hands. Showing that he's responsible with another custodianship will only help his case in today's hearing.

282,,2021-05-18 14:28:15,t3_nfc46d,,pennystocks,"Xigem Technologies issued a [huge report](https://www.xigemtechnologies.com/xigem-technologies-comments-on-the-state-of-remote-work/) that sums up the global state of remote work.  It's not just about $XIGM - it's a look on the whole gigantic global industry (which I can relate to, working from the couch for over a year now).

# Here are the key takeaways:

>**89%** of respondents worldwide now prefer to work from home at least occasionally. The preference was strongest among digital and knowledge-based workers, among whom 70% have worked remotely.

Source: [BCG study](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/89-of-people-expect-their-jobs-to-be-partly-remote-after-pandemic-ends-global-workforce-study-shows-301259126.html) of 209,000 people in 190 countries

>**68%** of U.S. workers believe a hybrid workplace model allowing at least one day of remote work per week is ideal

Source: [https://news.prudential.com/increasingly-workers-expect-pandemic-workplace-adaptations-to-stick.htm](https://news.prudential.com/increasingly-workers-expect-pandemic-workplace-adaptations-to-stick.htm)

Another one from the same research:

>**42%** say they will look for a new job if their current company does not continue to offer remote work options

The number in this study doesn't correlate with my previous research, tbh. A different study by EY shows that **over 50% of workers would look for a new job if they can't work from home at least sometimes.** [https://www.ey.com/en\_gl/news/2021/05/more-than-half-of-employees-globally-would-quit-their-jobs-if-not-provided-post-pandemic-flexibility-ey-survey-finds](https://www.ey.com/en_gl/news/2021/05/more-than-half-of-employees-globally-would-quit-their-jobs-if-not-provided-post-pandemic-flexibility-ey-survey-finds)

**In addition:**

>**60%** of companies will offer a hybrid work model allowing people to split their work between the office and home.\[4\]

Source: Forrester analyst for CNN [https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/09/success/remote-work-covid-pandemic-one-year-later/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/09/success/remote-work-covid-pandemic-one-year-later/index.html)

Large companies seem to adapt to the situation as well. These guys now offer flexible hybrid work options, according to the report:

* Ford;
* Facebook;
* Microsoft;
* Oracle;
* Shopify.

Now where's Xigem in this? Why did they even bother to make a report? Of course, here they are:

>**The shift towards working from home will lift productivity in the U.S. economy by 5%, mostly due to savings in commuting time, and also driven by the rapid adoption of new technology.**

Source: [National Bureau of Economic Research poll](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-22/yes-working-from-home-makes-you-more-productive-study-finds)

""There is no question that the way in which people work has experienced a fundamental shift, and that **businesses and organizations have adapted to the new realities by employing technology to support their growth**,"" said Brian Kalish, co-founder and CEO of Xigem Technologies. ""iAgent software coupled with our stated objective of aggregating technologies for the remote economy ideally positions Xigem to help organizations manage their teams, customers and clients across geographies and market sectors. We are actively pursuing customer opportunities, and expect that the remote management of human assets will prove to be among the key pillars of our strategy.""

# Conclusion:

Xigem Technologies (CSE: $XIGM) (FSE: $2C1) issued a big report on the remote work economy. The majority of workers feel better at home and are ready to leave their jobs if they'll be forced to get back to office. Xigem wants to dominate the emerging remote economy and works on it, their report definitely represents their interests, but hey - it's still a lot of numbers that sum up the whole industry, not just one company's future.

302,,2021-05-21 13:46:09,t3_nhswwz,,pennystocks,"**SAN DIEGO, CA / ACCESSWIRE / May 21, 2021 /**[KULR Technology Group, Inc.](https://pr.report/n8vTtger) (OTCQB:KULR) (the ""Company"" or ""KULR""), a leading developer of next-generation lithium-ion battery safety and thermal management technologies, today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2021.

KULR's Q1 revenue increased by 439% year-over-year as we continue to make significant investments in all areas of our business to sustain and expand in 2021 and beyond. We are pleased to announce the Company recently raised $6.5 million in capital on May 20, 2021. Our belief is that this investment validates the value our new investors see in KULR's ability to commercialize within additional e-mobility markets. This funding is expected to significantly strengthen the Company's balance sheet and further advance KULR's up listing process to a senior U.S. exchange.

KULR's business model continues to evolve as the Company focuses on near-term commercialization opportunities for its technology in the energy storage, electrical transportation, and battery transportation markets. We recently announced our first new smart battery product for the commercial drone market. This is the opening step of KULR's overall strategy to target adjacent markets complimentary to our established battery safety and thermal management products to expand into additional e-mobility markets in 2021. Additionally, we have targeted using our carbon fiber technology inside battery cells to make lighter and safer batteries with fast charge capability.

**First Quarter 2021 and Recent Operational Highlights**

* In April 2021, KULR announced the June 2021 launch of a new product line of high-capacity lithium battery packs targeting the $127 billion commercial drone market, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. The Company recently secured a global commercial drone manufacturer as a customer and expects to secure additional customers in the second half of 2021.
* In March 2021, Keith Cochran joined KULR as President and COO. Mr. Cochran was previously SVP of Global Business Unit at Jabil where he was responsible for the $3.7B smartphone business and managing over 65,000 employees in US and Asia. Keith brings over 25 years of experience in business operations, supply chain management and large-scale manufacturing automations.
* KULR became the official thermal management and battery safety technical partner for Andretti Technologies, the advanced technology arm of Andretti Autosport, founded by Michael Andretti. As part of the alliance, KULR will establish a thermal management testing and design platform for high performance battery solutions with the highest safety ratings specially adapted to the rigorous technical requirements of Andretti's global racing enterprise. Both partners will also focus on co-developing and co-marketing motorsports' battery and safety technologies to automotive partners for mass market EV applications.
* KULR strengthened its Board by the appointments of Joanna D. Massey and Morio Kurosaki as directors, contingent upon the Company's common stock being approved for up listing to a senior national exchange and expect their involvement to strengthen our corporate governance and strategic direction.
* In April 2021, KULR announced former Jabil Operations Manager, Antonio Martinez, as new Vice President of Operations. Mr. Martinez will be responsible for managing day-to-day operations of the Company's manufacturing department as well as supporting strategic growth goals. Mr. Martinez joins KULR with over 37 years of leadership and worldwide manufacturing experience in Electronics Manufacturing and Operations.
* KULR announced it was expanding its manufacturing presence to a new, larger facility in San Diego, CA to accommodate continued business growth.

**Financial Results: First Quarter 2021 vs. First Quarter 2020**

**Revenues**: KULR generated revenues of $417,905 in the first quarter ended March 31, 2021, an increase of 439% compared with revenues of $77,500 reported in the same period of 2020. The increase in revenue was mainly due to new orders received for products and engineering services for military and aerospace customers. The Company continues to build its relationships with a wide range of energy, transport and aerospace partners and actively served 13 customers in the quarter ending March 31, 2021.

These results reflect management's commitment to build new customer relationships through a growing pool of referrals and business development leads.

**Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses:** Our SG&A expenses increased to $1,492,811 in the first quarter of 2021 from $465,410 in the corresponding period last year. The 220% increase in SG&A expenses was due to additional marketing and advertising expenses, consulting fees and non-cash stock-based compensation paid to employees and consultants.

**R&D expenses:** We increased our R&D expenses in the first quarter of 2021 by 10% to $122,983 from $111,713 in the same period last year, reflecting a combination of headcount and process improvements implemented in the first quarter of 2021.

**Operating Loss:** Our loss from operations was $1,473,157 for the first quarter of 2021, compared to $529,666 for the comparable quarter of 2020. Higher selling, general and administrative costs offset higher sales.

**Net Loss**: Net loss for the first quarter of 2021 increased to $1,714,723 or a loss of $0.02 per share, compared with a net loss of $550,253, or a loss of $0.01 per share for the comparable period in 2020.

**Cash Position:** On March 31, 2021, we reported cash balances of $6,166,755 on March 31, 2021, compared with $8,880,140 on December 31, 2020. Subsequently, on May 20, 2021 we raised an additional $6.5 million in a preferred convertible financing agreement. This funding leaves us well positioned to expand operations, support new business, and fund ongoing product development despite the difficult Covid inspired trading conditions experienced through the latest quarter.

**Shareholder Update Call**

(OZSC), (“Ozop” or the “Company”), today announced an order for 10 electric vehicle charging stations to be installed in Bical Auto Mall dealerships in Brooklyn, NY, marking the first step in developing a regional NeoGrid Modular Network (patent pending) that will spark a new generation of electrical supply, storage & distribution.
> 
> The initial $80,000 order Bical placed in February through wholly owned subsidiary Ozop Energy Systems, Inc. (OES) and INF Associates, a multi-state energy efficiency and EV support company, called for four (4) dual port Level II Enel X Juice Pedestal chargers to be delivered and installed at two Bical locations. After further surveying the property and accounting for growing demand over the past three months, the order was increased almost eight-fold, resulting in the current order for 10 units at a pre-incentive cost of $600,000.
> 
> An order for an additional six (6) Level III rapid chargers, which could increase the sale by another $409,000 before rebates are applied, is pending approval from Con Edison.
> 
> “This announcement is not just about an order for individual charging stations,” said Brian Conway, CEO of Ozop Energy Systems. “This puts in motion our plan to eliminate the municipal grid or keep it as a luxury supplier instead of a necessary supplier of energy for electric vehicles.”
> 
> “As these systems are deployed,” he added, “we are increasing our network which, modular by design, can be deployed in days not months or even years in many urban areas, and we plan to expand to other markets in the near future.”

483,gyyeu3i,2021-05-21 15:53:13,t1_gyyeu3i,t1_gyy1aft,pennystocks,"Not an issue.  Intranasal is not novel.  It makes sense for their application so kudos to them for thinking about.  If you google teleflex LMA MAD you will see a commonly used intranasal device used by EMS folks.  

Interesting thing on their video was it looked like the device was designed to be expired from the mouth and redirected to the nasal cavity.  That is odd to say the least.  

More info. is needed to get a better understanding of WHAT the drug is in the first place.  My opinion, it is likely just a normal corticosteroid (like methylprednisone) which was modified, to make it proprietary, and being given intranasal for faster absorption to the brain.  We use high dose steroid for acute spinal cord injury so that is where they probably get the idea.  I can see it being helpful, but question if they prove it why anyone would not just use intranasal steroids (IF I am reading their approach correct) and not pay extra.  My assumption is that is why they are coming up with some cool sounding delivery system to market in the drug WITH its delivery system in one package as being more convenient.  Just a guess though.  When phase I is being done the protocol will have the methodology which will better describe what it is all about.",,

This coin has been in quiet development for the past 3  years and the time has come for some big strides. This product has grown  an enormous amount over the last couple of months and now is the time  it will start going berserk. It is at the point where the lifting off  starts and you really don't want to be late on this one. Don't say I  didn't warn you! I am talking about EUNO, a coin that will be unique in  paying possibilities at your local store. A lot of coins support  payments, but this is the first coin that will do so and not require a  merchant or store to accept crypto payments. EUNO has created EunoPay,  which works in a way that you can pay with EUNO (with very low fees) and  the merchant will receive Euros US dollars or any other relevant  currency. I will post some upsides and  downsides below and you can make your own decision instead of listening  to me. Please also have a look at the whitepaper of EUNO at their  website and don't miss out on this opportunity, you might really regret  it.

Upsides:  
- Low marketcap (~15 million) with insane opportunities to grow.
- Working project with real life application in the form of EunoPay. 
- Low fees, which is extremely important for mass adoption.  
- Real collaboration with specialized crypto player named Baanx.  
- Great development team, full marketing budget.

Downsides: 
- Low liquidity. 
- No big mainstream listings.

This coin has tremendous value and it will not be long until prices  go a lot higher after which you will blame yourself for not investing.  This is really the best time to buy EUNO, right before a big surge.  Think about your future and get some cheap EUNO before it's to late.
Euno CEO/COO Faustino Hernandez will have a zoom TODAY at 2pm Arizona Time.  Check him out on twitter for more information, his handle is P_Bateman86 and EunoCoin
Will see you there!",nhwmtw,Euno CEO/COO Faustino Hernandez will have a Zoom meeting TODAY at 2pm Arizona Time.

Got another weed stock for y'all! Icanic Brands got some serious potential in the pre-roll market. They know what their customer base wants and they attack it with an aggressive expansion strategy which has helped them succeed in California and Nevada. They seem like they're gonna keep ramping it up and try to break into other states as well.

Let's not waste any time and get right into the numbers. Their most recent financials are from January and they look fantastic. $2.8 Million in quarterly sales up 65% from last year and gross margins increasing considerably from 16% to 41%. That margin difference is huge and with some of their new acquisitions they have become extremely scalable and that number will likely grow even more. In fact, their goals for 2021 have a gross margin of over 50% and annualized revenue run rate up over $30M. All of these numbers are fantastic and will help the company generate some profit.

Some background qualitative research

* Sell products in California and Nevada
* Two large pre-roll brands Taylor and LeafLink's fastest-growing pre-roll Ganja Gold
* Recent deals with THC Engineering and Heavenly Sweets
* Fantastic management team including Mark Smith who has built tons of Cannabis start-ups

As I mentioned before, these guys love the expansion, and the deals with THC Engineering and Heavenly Sweets are just some examples. The first one in particular is awesome because it gives Icanic access to best-in-industry pre-roll manufacturing tech, which increases supply and lowers margins, A recipe for success! These guys are primed to ramp up their selling quantity and I think they are super undervalued.

At the end of the day, it's a penny stock with some good infrastructure and plans in the oven. Check em out, see if they're your type of investment, and I'd love to hear some of your opinions.

Do some research yourselves, this is not investment advice!",nhyh6g,"Icanic Brands, potentially an upcoming name in cannabis"

https://www.worldoil.com/news/2019/11/13/iea-predicts-global-oil-demand-will-level-off-around-2030

There are more optimistic studies but those have been funded by big oil companies.

If you think about it, the whole carbon free topic is pushed by USA and Europe and its not that much of a topic in emerging countries.

USA and Europe only represent about 1/8 of the world population. Even though the oil consumption is enormously higher then in the rest of the world its still less then half of the oil demand.

Many studies expect a fast increasing demand for oil in emerging countries as these countries grow their economy. I think thats plausible.

So in my mind oil is still around until 2050 at least, even if the media claims otherwise.

Btw anyone can download the presentation from the company website and use it for their DD posts.
I personally did so several times.

Also as I posted on a different thread about the app. 

If you wish to buy property for short term abnb rental you must have cash or get a loan on your primary residence and use the funds for that.  Banks and traditional lenders will not give you mortgage on a short term rental.  If it is investment property the generally want it in a business and it now becomes a business loan.  This is when it gets tricky.  Most banks want the property at least 50% owner occupied and the rest they are looking for ideally two years leases.  So without the long term Tennant you are not getting financing.  
How do I know this because I have been managing national banks for over 20 years and everyone's policy are pretty much the same.  
This app will link up the individual or institutional investor with the prospective property purchaser/owner to allow them to get financing. 

As far is a can tell on the crypto part it seems that is for the 10 properties they already own. If you invest in it they give you a crypto in return. However I may be wrong on that.  

Now I am a banker not a financial advisor so serious look this crap up yourself it is all there.  Secondly I am banker and not an English major so ignore typos misspelling and punctuation. Finally if you don't like it don't buy it if you do buy and hold this should have some good short term gains with long term growth.",,

In my OPINION, you should always diversify in almost any type of investing you do. I personally have 17 different OTC stocks at the moment. MOST OTC stocks will end up at $0.00 in the long term (and by most I mean 19/20) so unless you are extremely well versed in financial sheet analysis (I already know you aren't just by the question you asked) trying to pick out the perfect ones isn't doable for most people.

12 of the 17 stocks I own are more than 25% losses at the moment. 3 are profitable in the 10-20%ish return on investment range, and TWO I have made well over 1000% on each.

In the land of penny stocks it's about picking a couple that will have massive returns and knowing that most will leave you with a hole in your pocket if you hold them for too long.

Study a dozen stocks for about a month and then jump into the ones you deem to have potential after they have a big sell off. DON'T buy into hype or try to chase a rising share price",,

Your right I know more technical analysis but, that goes out the window with penny stocks. I only know to buy a penny stock if current liabilities are less than current asset and the same for total assets and liabilities. I look for triple digit percent revenues in the PRs. I look for cash on hand too. I was thinking of picking 3 only and the rest in stable companies. I'm thinking $AABB , $IQST , and $AYLI (A Speculation).",,

As the owner of an electric car, who also pays attention, charging stations are going to become travel stops only, like ""onroute"" or other highway centres with bathrooms and food for longer distance travellers. Charging stations will never replace gas stations, because Evs will almost exclusively recharge at the owners home, at night.

With a gas vehicle, I'm forced every 400-500km to visit a gas station to refuel, no matter what. With my EV, I only need a charging station if my trip (or cumulative trip over a short period) is over the capacity of my car. Otherwise I plug in every couple days at my house, it's one of the best parts of my EV. 

With an early generation kia Soul EV that goes 150km, the only time I need to use a charging station is when I go to my parents house, 150km away (and sometimes I can make in it a single charge). The current generation of the same car has another 100 or so Km in the bank, so everyone who bought 2 years after me, who lives like me, will almost NEVER need to visit a charging station. Ever.

Not stock advice, just an observation. As someone sitting at a charging station in the past wishing for more charging stations, I came to realize that once EVs get to a certain battery capacity (like many are now, in the 300-400km range) you won't need these stops, unless you are on a 4+ hour trip, and people will actively avoid them because they take time (20minutes or more) and cost money.

1) There has been a large INCREASE in diversity and inclusion issues covered by the media since June of 2020.
2) There was a TREMENDOUS amount of Twitter coverage and encouragement of people buying shares in minority owned/run businesses last year.
3) The Wall Street Journal published at least 2 stories in June of last year talking about people buying minority business shares in June 2020.
4) Twitter mentions of these 5 stocks have already started in 2021 several months ago.
5) The current US administration will most likely talk up the Juneteenth holiday MUCH more than the previous administration.
6) Major corporations (McDonalds, Walmart, JP Morgan, etc.) have announced strong support of these companies.  Corporate pressure on this topic is HIGH!
7) The increase of Robinhood users and communication forums like this one on Reddit have made MANY more people aware of opportunities such as this.

Only my opinion.  Do your own research.  Still 4 weeks left until June 19, 2021.

Every article I have posted says this is a $7-8 stock. I personally believe it's a 12 month $20 after share conversion.

992,gz0wxgq,2021-05-22 04:41:30,t1_gz0wxgq,t1_gyzytuk,pennystocks,"If you want the downsides of the play the article, EVEN if true, doesn't matter as that has nothing to do with the downside risks of the play.  

Here are the downside risks:

1.  They don't find commercial extractable oil.  They have already found oil so that is not an issue.  The already released it as a active petroleum system which is a VERY specific term in the O/G industry.  They can't say that as that unless it is true otherwise it is illegal.  If they weren't sure and were just trying to pump up the price they would have just been more vague to protect themselves from legal liability.  They are not stupid even if they were/ are crooks.
2. If they do find commercial extractable oil Namibia renegs and boots them out of the play to keep it all for themselves.  

The above are real concerns.  ALL the stuff in the NG article don't matter for the investor.  For example, lets say they are ALL true and recon still finds commercial oil, what happens?  The guilty go to jail and the shareholder STILL makes A TON of money as that doesn't affect their shares.  It isn't like the SEC is going to take the shares away from the investor.  So, for me at least, I don't see any of those accusations, even if ALL true, as any negative.  This ALL comes down to... can they find oil they can dig up in a CONVENTIONAL manner or not.  If the do we make money and if they don't we lose money.  It really is that simple. 

I absolutely do think Steinke played a pretty slick move in getting money by how he moved the rights to the play around, but keep in mind ALL of these transactions were passed through the regulators at the time with no issues so it isn't like they are going to have an issue with them now when they knew about them then when they allowed it.

I do agree folks should be aware of the downside risk of the play, but the NG has not bearing on the downside risk TO THE INVESTOR.  If true those guys will go to jail.  That outcome doesn't bother me as it doesn't affect me making money on the play (which is ALL related to pulling oil out of the ground).",,

I refuse to lose thousands of dollars when the price corrects in the forecoming months due to the 5.5B share dilution. 99% of competition that HMBL wants to go against has a share structure with less than 300M shares, and rakes in billions of dollars. Also, one of the biggest reason I sold too was because of the HMBL subreddit, literally an echo chamber and very cultish behavior.
