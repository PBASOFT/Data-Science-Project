There is a theory that if a hedge fund defaults basically all of the DTCC will be liquidated to bail out GME holders.

They would have no need for one. And for two they would have invisibility (bending light) at that level of advancement.

At some point it gets too high for a broker to take on that level of collateral and they can't offer a sale on that stock anymore.

I'm sure they did other things that are shitty, but I was too itchy with the trigger finger when it came to accusing them of manipulating the market, when it's actually the clearing house which sets the collateral rules for them.

Yet somehow I manage to drag this fat old bald bastard into the alley every day. I'm out there diggin' holes, fallin' into them, climbin' out, tryin' again, and tomorrow, I'm gonna hang outside at a ladies prison. And the first thing those lady cons are gonna see after 20 years? Is me. Will I get one? Experience says no. Will I be out there next month? If I'm alive you better believe it.

At which point Barrons and Forbes and all of them will start writing about how StarLink is this 'came out of nowhere company' that is providing something that has never existed (truly global, high speed low latency relatively cheap internet) and the VSAT is gonna lose a BIG chunk of their market cap.

There are two scenarios:
1. MOASS happens: there is plenty of DD covering the details of it and the infinite squeeze theory. So there is a chance the price would skyrocket (1k, 10k, 100k, 1m, etc). You decide when you sell.
2. MOASS does not happen: in this scenario, based on the latest events and RC's moves (dream team assembled, payment of long term debts, moving into e-commerce, nfts development,etc) the company could grow naturally to maybe $800 / share (I'm just guessing) in a few years.

Either way, just by holding on, you can make a statement against wall street corruption. It's your decision. I am not giving financial advice or whatever, I just like the company and I believe this is a truly unique event we are seeing. I am holding.",,

I mean, of course? The entire point of regulation is bureaucratic. You cannot have consistency in complex undertakings without a substantial amount of bureaucracy, and if nothing else, regulation must be consistent. There is no practical way to regulate financial markets without it.

> Even if they're doing the right thing at top speed (which I admittedly doubt) it may take years and we don't see much in the meantime

This is a valid criticism, and certainly the SEC has many flaws. I'd like to see far more funding going to hiring more regulators that impose harsher penalties more quickly generally in many fields, the securities industry included. But at the end of the day, there is no reasonably possible way to move on something like this immediately. Regulators cannot make snap judgments like people on reddit can without seriously damaging their credibility and hunches are not evidence. On top of all of that, securities markets, laws, and rules are extremely complex. Just sorting through the legal issues and getting it right takes a lot of time and effort.",,

This is a real game-changing technology which can offer a real alternative with an interchangeable battery technology for the existing lithium-ion batteries in almost every application with GMG’s Graphene and UQ’s patent-pending aluminum ion battery technology. The current nominal voltage of our batteries is 1.7 volts, and work is being carried out to increase the voltage to directly replace existing batteries and which lead to higher energy densities.

The real differentiator about these batteries is their very high power density of up to 7000 watts/kg, which endows them with a very high charge rate. Furthermore, graphene aluminum-ion batteries provide major benefits in terms of longer battery life (over 2000 charge / discharge cycles testing so far with no deterioration in performance), battery safety (very low fire potential) and lower environmental impact (more recyclable).

Sup, WSB folks!

It’s Roman here with my Technical ANALysis, remember me? I’m the guy who [put the beard on the line, stating that GME is heading at least to thousands](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/), soon, and my beard is doing well so far, as you may see. Furthermore, recently I did [AMC TA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfaizr/amc_looking_juicy_next_resistance_targets_1623/), and it got to [CBS fucking news](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/)! Btw, the first major resistance there of $16 has been broken already, $20 is the next one and the things are going according to the forecast.

Congrats to AMC hodlers, but today we’ll take a look at the superior stonk‘s current TA state, discussing how things might play out in the shorter term perspective.

The first thing to take a look at this [GME](https://imgur.com/a/eAxaHhE) chart, is the beautiful Bollinger Bands setup. Bollinger Bands is a powerful TA instrument, used by traders for the purpose of identifying potential support and resistance zones, as well as a trend direction. Furthermore, BB is a helpful tool to work with the volatility, as price action‘s fluctuations are taken as a cornerstone measurement for the Bollinger channels. As you should be able to see on the chart, with the volatility in Jan, Feb and Mar the BB channel looks thick (just as your BF’s GF’s ass). Since the beginning of April, though, the consolidation is obvious, and the channel consequently has been narrowing down. But BOOM, the breakout happened yesterday followed by the conformational solidly looking gap today. The setup of a very similar nature crystallized in January too (highlighted blue) and it is easy to see what happened afterwards. Juicy, what else can I say.

MACD. The thing points up, indicating the bullish momentum, with all of the threes indicators (MACD, Signal and Histogram) being on the bullish territory and accelerating with the current price action.

And the most important factor to 🐻 in mind, resistances. As I mentioned in the title, the Purple Haze ($233) is being tested currently, and to my understanding, this is the most important price level for GME currently (refer to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/) for the explanation). As soon as this one is conquered, $350 and $481 seem to be the next two major resistances on the horizon.

I hope, that you enjoyed this little piece of TA, have a great day!

Coronavirus is almost history folks. As the world is slowly opening, and restrictions being lifted (thank you to those who are vaccinated), There's still one last industry that is preparing for take off.

This summer airlines will make a comeback. Sooner rather than later travel will be back on the menu.

The CDC is lifting all restrictions for domestic travel for vaccinated people. It's only a matter of time before more restrictions are lifted.

"" If you [travel in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html), you do not need to get tested before or after travel or self-quarantine after travel.""

[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html)

&#x200B;

Europe is considering opening it's borders to vaccinated people possibly this summer although no date is set.

[https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/)

&#x200B;

Now that the hype of the vaccine has died down and people are seriously getting vaccinated airlines are set to have a comeback.

&#x200B;

Any airline will do fine but I believe that Canadian airlines will have the greatest comeback due to the very low amount of vaccinated citizens right now. As their vaccine rate goes up so will the stock prices of industries that will open up again.

The Canadian population is \~4% fully vaccinated while \~45% of them have had one dose.

[https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a7](https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a7)

Compared to \~40% fully vaccinated and \~50% with at least one dose in the US

[https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations)

&#x200B;

In a previous post I showed that Air Canada was the best Canadian airline to invest with. They are slowly step laddering up in price. In mid April they received a 5.9 billion dollar bailout from the government which secured their comeback. They are just waiting for restrictions to be lifted and I'm sure they've thought of ways to profit in a post-pandemic world.

&#x200B;

Whether you invest in airlines by paying for a fun experience, or by buying their stock, either way many people are going to give their money to airlines this summer. The question is which side will you be on?

Goodluck ladies and gents

&#x200B;

**TL;DR Airlines will make a comeback as restrictions lift. Canada still has a low vax population so the good news for them will cause greater surges in airline stock prices. I know many people who want to travel but few who want to buy stock.**",nlmxyt,How to profit from the final stages of Coronavirus

1384,,2021-05-26 17:48:02,t3_nlmzdx,,wallstreetbets,"Hello fellow WSB degens,

I will be outlining for you today why RIOT and MARA even after today's run up will continue on a meteoric rise.

Firstly the price is currently in the mid 20's for each stonk. This makes sense because back in Jan 2021 the prices of both stonks were in the mid 20's because a certain underlying asset these stonks are based on was trading at 40k and is currently trading once again at 40k. I will refer to this asset during this post as CUA for the rest of this post (certain underlying asset) disclaimer for mods this whole post does not really involve CUA going up or down it is based off of several factors that lead me to believe these specific stonks are undervalued at their current prices even if CUA goes down further. I am forced to mention CUA to explain this reasoning.

Now the fact these stonks are both in the mid $20's like they were back in Jan 2021 no longer makes sense when you factor in that RIOT has tripled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment and MARA has doubled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment. This is akin to a gold mine discovering there just so happened to be double or triple the amount of gold they previously thought was in their mine, or Amazon AWS buying 2-3 times more servers to rent out if AWS could somehow guarantee clients for all those servers 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year. More mining equipment = more revenue. You can tell this is starting to get realized because even though CUA is down today (26-5-21) both of these stonks are up double digits.

As if the above was not reason enough to think these stonks could reasonably 2x or 3x even without an increase in the price of CUA please continue reading.

Now on to China banning CUA mining in China. China controls 65% of the total hash rate of CUA. If China were to stop mining CUA this would bring down the total hash rate of CUA significantly. This would be very good for any and all remaining CUA miners as the CUA difficulty would also drop by 65%. 

To help you autists understand I will compare this to pizza. (Sorry I couldnt think of how to make this analogy with tendies)

If you have 1 pizza and 10 people and you wish to split the pizza equally you would slice the pizza into 10 slices and give everyone 1 slice. This is how CUA mining works. Now imagine that China currently takes 6.5 pieces of pizza but Chinese government is going to tell Chinese citizens they can no longer legally eat pizza in China. Now the rest of the world gets to split those 6.5 pieces of pizza amongst themselves equally. 

Personally I am too retarded to actually do the math to see how this would change MARA and RIOT revenue but it might be as simple as increasing all of their profit by 65%? Not sure. Maybe you divide 65 by 35 and then add that number (1.8) to all the other miners.

The above was all concrete reasoning on why these stonks are both undervalued, but theres a literally shitton of undervalued stonks and there are plenty of retarded overpriced stonks too who is to say that any of the above reasoning matters and the people will care? Theres a lot of stonks bottom line. What is my catalyst for believing these stonks will continue to see momentum and provide tendies?

The below is my retarded opinion and autist forecast into what will occur and provide said tendies to anyone who wishes to participate in the upside of these stocks.

The large majority if not all of this past correction in CUA price can be chalked up to China and Elon. Elon recently tweeted that he no longer liked CUA due to the process of mining being ""dirty"" this is because China controls 65% of the entire hash rate of CUA and China uses the most coal for energy of any country in the world. Elon has now tweeted that he will be meeting with miners in North America to discuss this fact and allow the miners to refute. What Elon will discover is that it is highly unprofitable to mine CUA on electricity deriving from non renewable energy sources as renewable energy sources are the cheapest. The vast majority of large mining operations in North America utilize hydropower RIOT and MARA both use hydropower too. The next thing that Elon will discover is that while China uses more coal for energy than any other country they also use more hydro for energy than any other country. China leads the world in hydroelectricity by any and all metrics including number of dams, sizes of dams, total output of individual dams, total output of all dams, etc. Mining on coal energy is stupid because it is the most expensive energy to produce of any energy. Seeing as how CUA miners only have to pay for internet and electricity bills and internet doesnt really matter cheap electricity makes or breaks their business. Literally RIOT and MARA have 8 employees and 3 employees according to Robinhood. The only bill/cost they care about is electric cost and they want that to be as cheap as possible which will always be renewable energy sources.

Personally I am of the belief that this is all part of Great Daddy Elon's master plan. He pretended to side with the environmentally friendly activists who advocate against CUA mining. This brought global attention to the issue and now he will unveil that he was wrong and this is not the case because mining is all green renewable energy. Great Daddy Elon is never wrong remember that. Elon has even stated things to the contrary of his recent tweet against CUA before when he talked about oil and coal energy subsidies in the US. Just remember that the gooberment says they want more green energy yet they heavily subsidize oil, gas, and coal energy. Until 2023 if you start an oil, gas, or coal energy project the government will subsidize for you to do so to the tune of financing 80-100 percent of the project. Yes that is right. That green stuff is a lie because the peak subsidy for solar projects was 33% and its now like 26%. Great Daddy Elon knows this because Great Daddy Elon knows all as he is the one who told us this.

1385,,2021-05-26 18:08:33,t3_nlnghi,,wallstreetbets,"TLDR: The entire ecosystem surrounding Energy Fuels is primed to make it a cornerstone US REE/Uranium company. Currently sitting under a 1B market cap - it is a ticking time 'bomb'.

The below will give short thesis in each market factor surrounding Energy Fuels.

**Uranium Squeeze** \- Unless you've been sitting under a rock over the past year you know that uranium mining around the world has all but dried up due to the low spot price (its not economically viable at the current price to mine uranium). Meaning that the **world wide consumption of uranium is far outpacing the production**. Currently, the low price is sustained by reserves but once these dry up the spot price is likely to rocket up. Energy Fuels is not only sitting on reserves but can start mining within 6 months. The spot price has gone from $28 -> $31 this past month and its anyone's guess when reserves will dry up but it seems to be an inevitability. This reddit post goes more in depth for the 2021 outlook on uranium supply - [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kpjvhs/2021_will_be_an_unforgettable_year_for_uranium/)

**REE** \- Likely the largest and most important development for this company is that Energy Fuels has a road map for a complete USA in-house REE production chain. If you don't know, the REE market is exploding right now due to many new demands in the market/short supply (pls research, not going to cover here). As a case study see MP - which has a **5B market cap compared to < 1B Energy Fuels**. Now MP has to ship their material oversees for processing in China which to the US is slowly being recognized as a serious national security issue. But in walks Energy Fuels which is proposing an end to end supply chain of REE material at its facility in White Mesa, Utah baby. Lets recap, Energy Fuels **is offering not only green energy solutions with uranium but a solution to a national security risk in the REE market.** good shit.

**Monazite vs Bastnaesite and radioactive material** \- Now that you had an intro to MP, lets get to an important detail that will allow Energy Fuels to take on the REE market quickly and effectively with an inherent advantage. MP produces REE material through the mining of Bastnaesite. However, Monazite ore (which is mined by Energy Fuels for uranium) is richer in rare earths. Ok but why then would MP not simply mine Monzanite???? Its because its radioactive and in the US, there are ungodly amounts of red tape/restrictions around the stuff which basically **makes it impossible to get a new permit to handle it.** But guess who already has one due to its uranium mining - god damn Energy Fuels which means they have already have their source material in line and ready to go with an advantage in REE richness - they just have to figure out processing which brings me to the next point. Not to mention the same material can be leverage for more uranium!

See the chart below to compare the two ores (the REE market us said to only really depend on 4 critical elements - Nd neodymium, Eu europium, Tb terbium, Dy dysprosium) [source](https://www.mining.com/the-only-five-rare-earth-elements-that-matter/)

https://preview.redd.it/s6s8qwy39i171.png?width=1412&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7d910feb79393f4fe0de5fad54e89f5bead4c39

**Financials** \- Feel free to check this dd yourself but Energy Fuels is **debt free** with **$40 million in liquid cash** that they have already said is going towards developing the REE pipeline. They have the source material, they are already mining it, and now they are building the US based processing for it :)

**History** **(\*this is more speculative)** \- Energy Fuels (as the uranium market is cyclical) has gone through huge up and down swings as seen below in 2007 and 2011. We are seeing the start of the run up. Hard to say if REE will provide stability to the chart but no reason to not jump on this coming spike

They are paying insane 70%+ interest on borrowed shares too. It’s a perfect storm. Got my popcorn ready. ""

Price action has been very nice the last few days with shorts climbing as price does steadily aswell. Approximately 20%+ of the float is being shorted according to TD. Also with this run up you bet your ass they are all in the red. Like I said in my last post, the company is currently buying back shares as of last week - so the float is likely smaller reported making the short % even higher.

With ex dividend coming up on 6/9 (match made in heaven) these shorts are sweating bricks because they know they need to cover or they will have to pay out that dividend for each share shorted on a losing position. As you are seeing towards the end of today they were trying to dump the price - likely done with even more shorts probably with the idea once they dump it enough they can cover this shit position and run. Chart below shows how its almost impossible for any short to be in the green.

[Also Schwab is telling me this is hard to borrow \(high short float\)](https://preview.redd.it/rbvjtk2zmi171.png?width=944&format=png&auto=webp&s=310642d4e17a29527ee49cc3ec4ec3780840d0c0)

DO NOT SELL HERE - the pump hasn't even started to begin Wall ST shits on the company because it was a SPAC so they shorted the fuck out of it and have been having a cash fiesta since the merger crashing the price down to laughable numbers.

THE ADVANTAGE WE HAVE IS OUR AWARENESS OF OUR RETARDATION THESE AUTISTIC HEDGE FUNDS THINK THEY ARE SMART AND CAN CONTROL PA TO ALWAYS WIN. THEY SOMEHOW THINK THAT WE ARE TO PREOCCUPIED WITH AMC AND GME BUT THEY DONT REALISE NO FUND IS SAFE.

Execute contracts if possible - I dont think there are enough shares out there to cover all these positions

TLDR: UWMC over shorted and they will have no choice to cover or pay out the dividend by 6/9 unless they can crash the price by shorting more.... Sounds familiar

Positions: shit load of shares, 8/20 $6 calls that will be executed before ex dividend. 8/20 $7 calls, the cheap play that i just loaded on are the 6/18 $9 calls. DO AS YOU WISH SHARES WILL WIN NO MATTER WHAT BUT PROVIDE LESS TENDIES",nlpfk9,UWMC Margin Warfare 2: Cover or pay me

Some people here have experience as baristas, store clerks, or restaurant owners that may have their own insights. So hopefully the quality of this post meets your standards as a way to engage in larger conversation about this exciting investment. 

**Some CONTENT before discussion my thoughts on the subject:**

\- 2017 resulted in 650 coffee shop locations, growing to 8500 retail and 10,000 coffee locations at the start of 2021

\- The Starbucks CEO has taken stake and pushed the product in it's stores.

\- It faces competition from brands like Planet Oat which is sold at locations like Dunkin Donuts. 

\- Investors include Jay-Z, who has recently been seated on the board of Square in 2021

\- The S-1 mentions competition in cashew and hemp meaning potential possibilities to expand into other cream based or protein powder style markets similar to Cola's expansion into variant beverages. It currently exists in yogurt and some cream markets already (more on this later)

\- Revenues have grown over 100% in the past year.

\- The company faces several lawsuits in Europe around branding with the name ""milk"", which marks the company as a legitimate disruptor in the industry. You may see the Oatly sold as ""Wow no cow!"" in some locations as a countertroll to the effort, meaning that the leadership is pretty ballsy.

\- The company posts losses mostly as a function of growth and aggressive marketting spend.

\- Women **strongly** drive this market, which is inline with other market trends related to women's education and household spending growth.

\- The industry growth in general is very strong and is on a path to upend most plant-based drinks that have had first mover advantage. This is an interesting counterpoint to the idea that the product will be commoditized when it can be a multiple-winner situation for organizations like Trader Joes, restaurants, Walmart, and Costco.

[Some additional CONTENT, for this discussion.](https://preview.redd.it/31xgrjieti171.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=0726ab6cbf236f0325c28f975193854062ef3d46)

**My Thoughts**

Anyway I've noticed none of you apes are talking about Oatly here which is crazy to say the least since this is a god tier $BECKY play. But then again you invest in Beyond and TTCF which are basically low tier products in the plant based world that are pushed by suits who have no idea wtf good quality plant-based foods are and would rather depend on first moving gimmicks. At least that's my opinion after being on a plant based diet for a decade.

Oatly is some good shit, top quality stuff. Beyond and Impossible still have a way to go to MEAT high quality standards, but tbh Oatly is definitely there with respect to substituting the deliciousness of milk and dairy based foods/desert. This is also interesting in the inclusivity sense as many consumers of the world are lactose intolerant. Many restaurants benefit from serving the best quality oat milk over a generic brand in the same vein that restaurants benefit from selling Pepsi and Coca Cola products.

What I'll be paying attention with Oatly GROUP while I read the S-1 will be how they view the general plant based market. If I see that leadership is looking ahead at markets like Cashew based creams or fermented cashew cheeses then it's all systems go for me. I mean these freaks already put oil in their milk so I wouldn't be surprised to see it. In some ways Oatly kind of reminds me of Coca Cola's ability to expand in beverage markets.

Trust me in the past 10 years, the vegan cheese and cooking game has definitely evolved and it is not terribly reliant on low tier substitutes like Daiya anymore.

Alright that's my useless rambling on the subject. Hopefully it engages you and we can discuss more about it.

1411,,2021-05-26 20:23:50,t3_nlqklx,,wallstreetbets,"First off. Forget that Blackberry is a phone company. Blackberry is a growth late stage start up that utilizes the logistics and patents of an old phone company

Black berry’s forward revenue will be dominated by two things. Cylance, their cyber security software, and IVY and QNX, their vehicle data hub. Let’s start with IVY and QNX

QNX is a software for vehicles to compartmentalize all their software and data. It’s essentially an operating system for smart cars. It is currently in 175 million vehicles, with more being added every day. Any company without proprietary software (almost all of them besides Tesla) rely on QNX to run their cars’ software 

IVY is a software that reads and organizes vehicle sensor data being picked up by QNX. This is a software in the process of being rolled out, that will create the early stages of a third party self driving solution for any car company without a proprietary self driving software (almost all of them besides Tesla.) With neural networks, which are what are used to make cars self drive, data is king, and you need a lot of it. It will not be an easy thing for car companies to build themselves. And when it comes time to compete with Tesla’s self driving cars, they’ll all be clamoring for IVY

Cylance - Blackberry Cylance is an AI driven anti virus software. It’s confusing, but the gist is that there are many variations of the same virus, most being one time use and have never been seen before, and AI anti virus is needed to detect and stop all the variations. Cylance has been able to stop the attack used by dark side, the hack that brought down the colonial pipeline, since 2015

Deep Fucking Value - black berry is currently trading with a market cap of 4.8 billion dollars. It’s cash on hand is $739 million. Bringing the market cap to $4 billion. It also has 38,000 patents, some of which are in the process of being sold to Facebook for potentially 1-2 billion dollars. On the low end of these patent sales, this puts the market cap at $3 billion.

That’s $3 billion dollars for a key cog in the self driving pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) a key cog in the smart car pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) and a key player in the cyber security industry (a $250 billion dollar industry)

TLDR --Premise-- ViaSat, Inc (VSAT) is a mediocre company that provides mediocre satellite service that costs way too much for what it is.... but in many places it is the ONLY option... well it was until Mr. 🚀 himself decided to eat their lunch. StarLink (part of SpaceX) is about to absolutely destroy VSAT and turn it to 💩.

TLDR --Strategy-- since you can't invest in SpaceX (private company) or Starlink (until it is spun off into a separate entity **and then DO invest there** ) I think someone that decides to buy PUTS on VSAT (give yourself A LOT of time, I'm talking June 2022 $35 or Jan 2023 $25) stands to make a lot of money ------ I'm personally not starting my position until right before the next earnings report in August. I figure the first sign of trouble will come out in an earnings report and if it isn't August then by November it'll start showing. Again **LONG** duration puts. Looking to catch that cycle when the company drops 50% on the bad news. If it goes up between now and then I'll just buy MORE puts. 

**NOT A PROFESSIONAL FINANCIAL PERSON - INVEST AT YOUR OWN RISK - I THINK THIS MAKES SENSE BUT I MAY BE 🤪🤪🤪🤪 PERSON WHO EATS 💩 FOR ALL YOU KNOW**

details

**ViaSat - How it started**

Market cap of 3.26 Billion, share price of $47.55 when I'm writing this. It got as high as the 90's before the pandemic book the shins out of the market and dropped it to $28. Since recovered a bit to... as I said $47.55

They have some satellites in space that allow people with a receiver dish to get internet from space like some kind of awesome scifi movie.... except the internet is crazy expensive for what you get. Their satellites are pretty high up and that means each one can cover a BIG area. They only seem to have a handful, maybe a dozen? But they offer pretty broad coverage and are expanding it. BUT because the satellites are high up the latency (time between your computer and your internet source or something like that) is high leading to slow speeds and overall not a great service.

They already have airlines as customers, expanding recently with Delta. Their is VERY LITTLE competition in this business and between airlines, cruise lines and rural home owners with no other option they make a nice amount of money. Totally solid business model. Internet is ever more and more important and usage on air planes and boats is only gonna go up. In fact like a lot of articles on VSAT I would probably say this is a good medium / long term buy and that is why the median price target is $67 ***EXCEPT*** I know something that the market doesn't seem to have realized yet.

>EDITED BASED ON COMMENTS  
>  
>ViaSat does have commercial business beyond airlines and cruises; I would imagine rural businesses and some VERY LARGE corporations that use it for specific use cases. There is also the DOD which they have contracts with.

>**I AM NOT ASSERTING THAT VIA SAT WILL GO COMPLETELY OUT OF BUSINESS.**  
>  
>  
>  
>However, while a viable company may exist beyond the coming reckoning I expect the market to react extremely negatively to ViaSat losing **ALL** of their rural residential and rural small and medium size business customers. I'm also thinking that right around the time that starts sinking in news stories about cruise lines and air lines switching over to StarLink will start popping up and again, $VSAT go **💩.** I honestly hope VSAT does go up to the current target of the mid $60's because I'll start buying puts a small chunk at a time as it rises. Until then I'm waiting till August, right before next quarterly earnings report to start my position.

**StarLink - How it's going**

as you may the Dogefather happens to have a small 🚀 company. Its called SpaceX and they aren't publicly traded. They also are doing to the aerospace / orbit supply and transport industry what many of us wish Tesla could fully due to the fossil fuel industry. SpaceX's Falcon9 🚀 is all sorts of amazing - mainly because it isn't thrown out after each use ($40MM in savings for each subsequent use of a booster).

StarLink is a division of SpaceX that is focused on bringing internet to the whole 🌎 using a crazy amount of satellites. Like... A LOT. Unlike ViaSat which has a few the StarLink constellation (thats what they call a network of satellites) has 16 HUNDRED and they are launching 60 at a time every week or so (sometimes more than once a week). Because StarLink has access to this game changing super cheap 🚀 transportation AND Musk is doing is usual weirdness by mass producing these satellites and focusing on cost and volume instead of making them SUPER DUPER reliable

Some of you may remember how TSLA was this tiny company that was prob gonna die etc. etc. and THEN 💥💥 there are Model 3's and Model Y's EVERYWHERE. Well StarLink is gonna have that moment soon. Sometime in the next few months there will suddenly be high-ish speed internet (between 50mbs and 100mbs) literally ANYWHERE on the planet for $500 down and $100 a month. Way better product and on an annualized basis way better value.",nlsu85,First real post on WSB - found a walking zombie 🧟 and wanted to share... I bring you a tale of.... $VSAT

Performance can only be measured through the entire cycle.    The entire Cycle exposes you from all angles. 

The human brain tends to become infected with greed at the end of a big Stage 2 run (see digital  virtuals  for current example) thus causing people to lose money after a bull market because they expect it to go on forever.

  Understanding Stage Analysis can help you overcome this  

&#x200B;

So now let's  dig in our today's post and my targets  : 

1-  Silver will enjoy huge capital flows from those digital assets  holders in a time after overcame and understand stage analysis .... who will now seek the silver whale! 

&#x200B;

2- We are in stage 2 for silver  !!! We can expect parabolic moves any time .  

 Opportunity of buying silver cheap and timely is about to end. 

 Silver has never failed to reach it's ALL-TIME highs after gold does it first.  ( gold did it 2020 July ) 

So, it's not a questions of IF... but WHEN?  

Tic Toc !

&#x200B;

3-  Silver is in a position of strength. US Dollar is in a position of weakness. 

 The final 15% decline in the US Dollar index WILL send silver parabolic!

&#x200B;

4-  The ""silver"" macro tidal wave is picking up steam &will crush all price suppression along the way...  Q2 close will set the stage how fast the insanity picks up.  HOLD ON TIGHT! Easy 56$ and 120$ targets 

This is not financial advice . I hold 1700 ozz of physical silver .",nlt5x7,Understanding Stage Analysis and ready for big explosive moves !

Please people its getting out of hand. I saw a dude say he will shit on his bosses desk and some other wierd shit if the stock reaches x dollars.

Guys if ur gonna do something be humble and make it something positive. 

Get a homeless guy a meal. 
Adopt a shelter cat/dog. (rescue)
What ever may benefit someone/you. 

Im just saying this cuz people think it's funny to repeat the same joke just turning it up a notch. That's not cool imo. What started as getting a tattoo has now grew into actual crimes (shitting on your employee's /boss's desk.). Things usually escalate slowly but we don't want to reach that no return. 

So please make the escalation positive. Start something new. Im saying this in all seriousness. Many people joke around and dont realise that a small action could change around someone's day or even their life. 

Just think of this before you say you will do something if gme reaches x dollars. 

Thank you and stay strong apes",nlty79,"Read this before you up vote ""ill do x if gme reaches y dollars(with proof) """

Stock prices change everyday by market forces. By this we mean that share prices change because of supply and demand. If more people want to buy a stock (demand) than sell it (supply), then the price moves up. Conversely, if more people wanted to sell a stock than buy it, there would be greater supply than demand, and the price would fall.",,

NIO is also close to recording a profit and will probably record a profit this year despite the chip shortage. Their YOY sales have been rising astronomically, their production has been increasing and they're slowly improving their supply chain/production. It's extremely hard to make EV cars and the fact they're producing quality EV and are close to making a profit is a good sign. Just look at some of the gimmick EV companies like Lordstown, Lucid Motors, etc, who aren't even on track to producing cars. 

Even if they struggle in Europe they're on track on becoming a major player in China and possibly other Asian markets. I'm personally bullish on them but I understand why people will be scared away such as the fact that NIO is very reliant on the Chinese government and facilities for production.",,

2304,gzkrlea,2021-05-26 23:37:10,t1_gzkrlea,t1_gzkpqro,wallstreetbets,"You clearly didn't read the article I linked. Market makers buy far more shares to hedge a call they sold than you could afford by using the same money used to buy a call to buy shares. Let's take GME as an example. Market makers hedge by delta*100. A 5/28 $240 GME call has a delta of 0.5558 according to Webull. That means for the cost of a 5/28 $240 call, $1475, a market maker will buy 55.58 shares, or 56 shares rounded. Conversely, $1475 would only buy about 6 GME shares. So by buying a $240 5/28 GME call, you would effectively purchase 50 more shares of GME than had you bought the shares yourself, prompting the purchase of far more shares with the same amount of money and thus driving the price of the stock up to a much greater degree. The same holds for every other ticker. It's options that are contributing to this price action.",,

The upheaval of the past years has been great. All markets have been merged into one mega market called The Stonk Market. Shares are now called “tendies”. Floor traders are now shouting “give me 500 tendies of Apple!”. All brokers are called either “autists” or “tards” based on their success. The title of hedge fund manager is now passé. The title of Grand Tard Wrangler is now used exclusively. 

There is a new breed of wealthy person in the world. Country clubs have renovated their golfing lands into paintball grounds and go-kart tracks. Country clubs are no longer seen as being prestigious by their history or clientele but by how good the tendies they serve are and which one has the most bad ass water slide. 

Birth rates skyrocket as 9’s and 10’s suddenly realize how attracted they are to that person working at Wendy’s with a brokerage app and a wild ass YOLO in their heart. 

All ape poaching has come to a screeching halt as protection rangers are now all equipped with what can only be described as “an Ironman style gorilla suit”. 

Cathie Wood has completely lost her mind and now runs a public access show where she throws chicken bones and channels dead people to make stonk predictions. 

And this was all possible because you didn’t get bitch hands when you finally went green again during the squeeze. 

And PLTR is still a trash stock hovering around $18.",,

Sup, WSB folks!

It’s Roman here with my Technical ANALysis, remember me? I’m the guy who [put the beard on the line, stating that GME is heading at least to thousands](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/), soon, and my beard is doing well so far, as you may see. Furthermore, recently I did [AMC TA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfaizr/amc_looking_juicy_next_resistance_targets_1623/), and it got to [CBS fucking news](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/)! Btw, the first major resistance there of $16 has been broken already, $20 is the next one and the things are going according to the forecast.

Congrats to AMC hodlers, but today we’ll take a look at the superior stonk‘s current TA state, discussing how things might play out in the shorter term perspective.

The first thing to take a look at this [GME](https://imgur.com/a/eAxaHhE) chart, is the beautiful Bollinger Bands setup. Bollinger Bands is a powerful TA instrument, used by traders for the purpose of identifying potential support and resistance zones, as well as a trend direction. Furthermore, BB is a helpful tool to work with the volatility, as price action‘s fluctuations are taken as a cornerstone measurement for the Bollinger channels. As you should be able to see on the chart, with the volatility in Jan, Feb and Mar the BB channel looks thick (just as your BF’s GF’s ass). Since the beginning of April, though, the consolidation is obvious, and the channel consequently has been narrowing down. But BOOM, the breakout happened yesterday followed by the conformational solidly looking gap today. The setup of a very similar nature crystallized in January too (highlighted blue) and it is easy to see what happened afterwards. Juicy, what else can I say.

MACD. The thing points up, indicating the bullish momentum, with all of the threes indicators (MACD, Signal and Histogram) being on the bullish territory and accelerating with the current price action.

And the most important factor to 🐻 in mind, resistances. As I mentioned in the title, the Purple Haze ($233) is being tested currently, and to my understanding, this is the most important price level for GME currently (refer to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/) for the explanation). As soon as this one is conquered, $350 and $481 seem to be the next two major resistances on the horizon.

I hope, that you enjoyed this little piece of TA, have a great day! 

(and compulsory not a fin advise and fuck you!)",nlmlev,"Daym it feels good to be a GME hodler in times like these! Take a look at this sweet TA picture: Bollinger Bands are boilin', MACD(onalds) pointing north... And the Purple Haze is being tested! How do you like this, Wen Moon?"

Coronavirus is almost history folks. As the world is slowly opening, and restrictions being lifted (thank you to those who are vaccinated), There's still one last industry that is preparing for take off.

This summer airlines will make a comeback. Sooner rather than later travel will be back on the menu.

The CDC is lifting all restrictions for domestic travel for vaccinated people. It's only a matter of time before more restrictions are lifted.

"" If you [travel in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html), you do not need to get tested before or after travel or self-quarantine after travel.""

[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html)

&#x200B;

Europe is considering opening it's borders to vaccinated people possibly this summer although no date is set.

[https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/)

&#x200B;

Now that the hype of the vaccine has died down and people are seriously getting vaccinated airlines are set to have a comeback.

&#x200B;

Any airline will do fine but I believe that Canadian airlines will have the greatest comeback due to the very low amount of vaccinated citizens right now. As their vaccine rate goes up so will the stock prices of industries that will open up again.

The Canadian population is \~4% fully vaccinated while \~45% of them have had one dose.

[https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a7](https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a7)

&#x200B;

Compared to \~40% fully vaccinated and \~50% with at least one dose in the US

[https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations)

&#x200B;

In a previous post I showed that Air Canada was the best Canadian airline to invest with. They are slowly step laddering up in price. In mid April they received a 5.9 billion dollar bailout from the government which secured their comeback. They are just waiting for restrictions to be lifted and I'm sure they've thought of ways to profit in a post-pandemic world.

&#x200B;

Whether you invest in airlines by paying for a fun experience, or by buying their stock, either way many people are going to give their money to airlines this summer. The question is which side will you be on?

Goodluck ladies and gents

&#x200B;

**TL;DR Airlines will make a comeback as restrictions lift. Canada still has a low vax population so the good news for them will cause greater surges in airline stock prices. I know many people who want to travel but few who want to buy stock.**",nlmxyt,How to profit from the final stages of Coronavirus

3384,,2021-05-26 17:48:02,t3_nlmzdx,,wallstreetbets,"Hello fellow WSB degens,

I will be outlining for you today why RIOT and MARA even after today's run up will continue on a meteoric rise.

Firstly the price is currently in the mid 20's for each stonk. This makes sense because back in Jan 2021 the prices of both stonks were in the mid 20's because a certain underlying asset these stonks are based on was trading at 40k and is currently trading once again at 40k. I will refer to this asset during this post as CUA for the rest of this post (certain underlying asset) disclaimer for mods this whole post does not really involve CUA going up or down it is based off of several factors that lead me to believe these specific stonks are undervalued at their current prices even if CUA goes down further. I am forced to mention CUA to explain this reasoning.

Now the fact these stonks are both in the mid $20's like they were back in Jan 2021 no longer makes sense when you factor in that RIOT has tripled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment and MARA has doubled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment. This is akin to a gold mine discovering there just so happened to be double or triple the amount of gold they previously thought was in their mine, or Amazon AWS buying 2-3 times more servers to rent out if AWS could somehow guarantee clients for all those servers 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year. More mining equipment = more revenue. You can tell this is starting to get realized because even though CUA is down today (26-5-21) both of these stonks are up double digits.

As if the above was not reason enough to think these stonks could reasonably 2x or 3x even without an increase in the price of CUA please continue reading.

Now on to China banning CUA mining in China. China controls 65% of the total hash rate of CUA. If China were to stop mining CUA this would bring down the total hash rate of CUA significantly. This would be very good for any and all remaining CUA miners as the CUA difficulty would also drop by 65%. 

To help you autists understand I will compare this to pizza. (Sorry I couldnt think of how to make this analogy with tendies)

If you have 1 pizza and 10 people and you wish to split the pizza equally you would slice the pizza into 10 slices and give everyone 1 slice. This is how CUA mining works. Now imagine that China currently takes 6.5 pieces of pizza but Chinese government is going to tell Chinese citizens they can no longer legally eat pizza in China. Now the rest of the world gets to split those 6.5 pieces of pizza amongst themselves equally. 

Personally I am too retarded to actually do the math to see how this would change MARA and RIOT revenue but it might be as simple as increasing all of their profit by 65%? Not sure. Maybe you divide 65 by 35 and then add that number (1.8) to all the other miners.

The above was all concrete reasoning on why these stonks are both undervalued, but theres a literally shitton of undervalued stonks and there are plenty of retarded overpriced stonks too who is to say that any of the above reasoning matters and the people will care? Theres a lot of stonks bottom line. What is my catalyst for believing these stonks will continue to see momentum and provide tendies?

The below is my retarded opinion and autist forecast into what will occur and provide said tendies to anyone who wishes to participate in the upside of these stocks.

The large majority if not all of this past correction in CUA price can be chalked up to China and Elon. Elon recently tweeted that he no longer liked CUA due to the process of mining being ""dirty"" this is because China controls 65% of the entire hash rate of CUA and China uses the most coal for energy of any country in the world. Elon has now tweeted that he will be meeting with miners in North America to discuss this fact and allow the miners to refute. What Elon will discover is that it is highly unprofitable to mine CUA on electricity deriving from non renewable energy sources as renewable energy sources are the cheapest. The vast majority of large mining operations in North America utilize hydropower RIOT and MARA both use hydropower too. The next thing that Elon will discover is that while China uses more coal for energy than any other country they also use more hydro for energy than any other country. China leads the world in hydroelectricity by any and all metrics including number of dams, sizes of dams, total output of individual dams, total output of all dams, etc. Mining on coal energy is stupid because it is the most expensive energy to produce of any energy. Seeing as how CUA miners only have to pay for internet and electricity bills and internet doesnt really matter cheap electricity makes or breaks their business. Literally RIOT and MARA have 8 employees and 3 employees according to Robinhood. The only bill/cost they care about is electric cost and they want that to be as cheap as possible which will always be renewable energy sources.

Personally I am of the belief that this is all part of Great Daddy Elon's master plan. He pretended to side with the environmentally friendly activists who advocate against CUA mining. This brought global attention to the issue and now he will unveil that he was wrong and this is not the case because mining is all green renewable energy. Great Daddy Elon is never wrong remember that. Elon has even stated things to the contrary of his recent tweet against CUA before when he talked about oil and coal energy subsidies in the US. Just remember that the gooberment says they want more green energy yet they heavily subsidize oil, gas, and coal energy. Until 2023 if you start an oil, gas, or coal energy project the government will subsidize for you to do so to the tune of financing 80-100 percent of the project. Yes that is right. That green stuff is a lie because the peak subsidy for solar projects was 33% and its now like 26%. Great Daddy Elon knows this because Great Daddy Elon knows all as he is the one who told us this.

The below will give short thesis in each market factor surrounding Energy Fuels.

**Uranium Squeeze** \- Unless you've been sitting under a rock over the past year you know that uranium mining around the world has all but dried up due to the low spot price (its not economically viable at the current price to mine uranium). Meaning that the **world wide consumption of uranium is far outpacing the production**. Currently, the low price is sustained by reserves but once these dry up the spot price is likely to rocket up. Energy Fuels is not only sitting on reserves but can start mining within 6 months. The spot price has gone from $28 -> $31 this past month and its anyone's guess when reserves will dry up but it seems to be an inevitability. This reddit post goes more in depth for the 2021 outlook on uranium supply - [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kpjvhs/2021_will_be_an_unforgettable_year_for_uranium/)

**REE** \- Likely the largest and most important development for this company is that Energy Fuels has a road map for a complete USA in-house REE production chain. If you don't know, the REE market is exploding right now due to many new demands in the market/short supply (pls research, not going to cover here). As a case study see MP - which has a **5B market cap compared to < 1B Energy Fuels**. Now MP has to ship their material oversees for processing in China which to the US is slowly being recognized as a serious national security issue. But in walks Energy Fuels which is proposing an end to end supply chain of REE material at its facility in White Mesa, Utah baby. Lets recap, Energy Fuels **is offering not only green energy solutions with uranium but a solution to a national security risk in the REE market.** good shit.

**Monazite vs Bastnaesite and radioactive material** \- Now that you had an intro to MP, lets get to an important detail that will allow Energy Fuels to take on the REE market quickly and effectively with an inherent advantage. MP produces REE material through the mining of Bastnaesite. However, Monazite ore (which is mined by Energy Fuels for uranium) is richer in rare earths. Ok but why then would MP not simply mine Monzanite???? Its because its radioactive and in the US, there are ungodly amounts of red tape/restrictions around the stuff which basically **makes it impossible to get a new permit to handle it.** But guess who already has one due to its uranium mining - god damn Energy Fuels which means they have already have their source material in line and ready to go with an advantage in REE richness - they just have to figure out processing which brings me to the next point. Not to mention the same material can be leverage for more uranium!

See the chart below to compare the two ores (the REE market us said to only really depend on 4 critical elements - Nd neodymium, Eu europium, Tb terbium, Dy dysprosium) [source](https://www.mining.com/the-only-five-rare-earth-elements-that-matter/)

**Financials** \- Feel free to check this dd yourself but Energy Fuels is **debt free** with **$40 million in liquid cash** that they have already said is going towards developing the REE pipeline. They have the source material, they are already mining it, and now they are building the US based processing for it :)

**History** **(\*this is more speculative)** \- Energy Fuels (as the uranium market is cyclical) has gone through huge up and down swings as seen below in 2007 and 2011. We are seeing the start of the run up. Hard to say if REE will provide stability to the chart but no reason to not jump on this coming spike

EDIT: short TLDR by u/turnerdhr23 

"" The shorts doubled up in May, from 11 million shares in April to 18.5 million shares in May. Up over 50% from April short numbers. They are trying everything they can, but you can’t fight buybacks, dividend on 6/9, inclusion in MSCI and Russell, and technicals switching to bullish. They are paying insane 70%+ interest on borrowed shares too. It’s a perfect storm. Got my popcorn ready. ""

Price action has been very nice the last few days with shorts climbing as price does steadily aswell. Approximately 20%+ of the float is being shorted according to TD. Also with this run up you bet your ass they are all in the red. Like I said in my last post, the company is currently buying back shares as of last week - so the float is likely smaller reported making the short % even higher.

With ex dividend coming up on 6/9 (match made in heaven) these shorts are sweating bricks because they know they need to cover or they will have to pay out that dividend for each share shorted on a losing position. As you are seeing towards the end of today they were trying to dump the price - likely done with even more shorts probably with the idea once they dump it enough they can cover this shit position and run. Chart below shows how its almost impossible for any short to be in the green.

[Also Schwab is telling me this is hard to borrow \(high short float\)](https://preview.redd.it/rbvjtk2zmi171.png?width=944&format=png&auto=webp&s=310642d4e17a29527ee49cc3ec4ec3780840d0c0)

DO NOT SELL HERE - the pump hasn't even started to begin Wall ST shits on the company because it was a SPAC so they shorted the fuck out of it and have been having a cash fiesta since the merger crashing the price down to laughable numbers.

THE ADVANTAGE WE HAVE IS OUR AWARENESS OF OUR RETARDATION THESE AUTISTIC HEDGE FUNDS THINK THEY ARE SMART AND CAN CONTROL PA TO ALWAYS WIN. THEY SOMEHOW THINK THAT WE ARE TO PREOCCUPIED WITH AMC AND GME BUT THEY DONT REALISE NO FUND IS SAFE.

Execute contracts if possible - I dont think there are enough shares out there to cover all these positions

TLDR: UWMC over shorted and they will have no choice to cover or pay out the dividend by 6/9 unless they can crash the price by shorting more.... Sounds familiar

Positions: shit load of shares, 8/20 $6 calls that will be executed before ex dividend. 8/20 $7 calls, the cheap play that i just loaded on are the 6/18 $9 calls. DO AS YOU WISH SHARES WILL WIN NO MATTER WHAT BUT PROVIDE LESS TENDIES",nlpfk9,UWMC Margin Warfare 2: Cover or pay me

Some people here have experience as baristas, store clerks, or restaurant owners that may have their own insights. So hopefully the quality of this post meets your standards as a way to engage in larger conversation about this exciting investment. 

**Some CONTENT before discussion my thoughts on the subject:**

\- 2017 resulted in 650 coffee shop locations, growing to 8500 retail and 10,000 coffee locations at the start of 2021

\- The Starbucks CEO has taken stake and pushed the product in it's stores.

\- It faces competition from brands like Planet Oat which is sold at locations like Dunkin Donuts. 

\- Investors include Jay-Z, who has recently been seated on the board of Square in 2021

\- The S-1 mentions competition in cashew and hemp meaning potential possibilities to expand into other cream based or protein powder style markets similar to Cola's expansion into variant beverages. It currently exists in yogurt and some cream markets already (more on this later)

\- Revenues have grown over 100% in the past year.

\- The company faces several lawsuits in Europe around branding with the name ""milk"", which marks the company as a legitimate disruptor in the industry. You may see the Oatly sold as ""Wow no cow!"" in some locations as a countertroll to the effort, meaning that the leadership is pretty ballsy.

\- The company posts losses mostly as a function of growth and aggressive marketting spend.

\- Women **strongly** drive this market, which is inline with other market trends related to women's education and household spending growth.

\- The industry growth in general is very strong and is on a path to upend most plant-based drinks that have had first mover advantage. This is an interesting counterpoint to the idea that the product will be commoditized when it can be a multiple-winner situation for organizations like Trader Joes, restaurants, Walmart, and Costco.

[Some additional CONTENT, for this discussion.](https://preview.redd.it/31xgrjieti171.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=0726ab6cbf236f0325c28f975193854062ef3d46)

**My Thoughts**

Anyway I've noticed none of you apes are talking about Oatly here which is crazy to say the least since this is a god tier $BECKY play. But then again you invest in Beyond and TTCF which are basically low tier products in the plant based world that are pushed by suits who have no idea wtf good quality plant-based foods are and would rather depend on first moving gimmicks. At least that's my opinion after being on a plant based diet for a decade.

Oatly is some good shit, top quality stuff. Beyond and Impossible still have a way to go to MEAT high quality standards, but tbh Oatly is definitely there with respect to substituting the deliciousness of milk and dairy based foods/desert. This is also interesting in the inclusivity sense as many consumers of the world are lactose intolerant. Many restaurants benefit from serving the best quality oat milk over a generic brand in the same vein that restaurants benefit from selling Pepsi and Coca Cola products.

What I'll be paying attention with Oatly GROUP while I read the S-1 will be how they view the general plant based market. If I see that leadership is looking ahead at markets like Cashew based creams or fermented cashew cheeses then it's all systems go for me. I mean these freaks already put oil in their milk so I wouldn't be surprised to see it. In some ways Oatly kind of reminds me of Coca Cola's ability to expand in beverage markets.

Trust me in the past 10 years, the vegan cheese and cooking game has definitely evolved and it is not terribly reliant on low tier substitutes like Daiya anymore.

Alright that's my useless rambling on the subject. Hopefully it engages you and we can discuss more about it.

Black berry’s forward revenue will be dominated by two things. Cylance, their cyber security software, and IVY and QNX, their vehicle data hub. Let’s start with IVY and QNX

QNX is a software for vehicles to compartmentalize all their software and data. It’s essentially an operating system for smart cars. It is currently in 175 million vehicles, with more being added every day. Any company without proprietary software (almost all of them besides Tesla) rely on QNX to run their cars’ software 

IVY is a software that reads and organizes vehicle sensor data being picked up by QNX. This is a software in the process of being rolled out, that will create the early stages of a third party self driving solution for any car company without a proprietary self driving software (almost all of them besides Tesla.) With neural networks, which are what are used to make cars self drive, data is king, and you need a lot of it. It will not be an easy thing for car companies to build themselves. And when it comes time to compete with Tesla’s self driving cars, they’ll all be clamoring for IVY

Cylance - Blackberry Cylance is an AI driven anti virus software. It’s confusing, but the gist is that there are many variations of the same virus, most being one time use and have never been seen before, and AI anti virus is needed to detect and stop all the variations. Cylance has been able to stop the attack used by dark side, the hack that brought down the colonial pipeline, since 2015

Deep Fucking Value - black berry is currently trading with a market cap of 4.8 billion dollars. It’s cash on hand is $739 million. Bringing the market cap to $4 billion. It also has 38,000 patents, some of which are in the process of being sold to Facebook for potentially 1-2 billion dollars. On the low end of these patent sales, this puts the market cap at $3 billion.

That’s $3 billion dollars for a key cog in the self driving pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) a key cog in the smart car pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) and a key player in the cyber security industry (a $250 billion dollar industry)

TLDR --Premise-- ViaSat, Inc (VSAT) is a mediocre company that provides mediocre satellite service that costs way too much for what it is.... but in many places it is the ONLY option... well it was until Mr. 🚀 himself decided to eat their lunch. StarLink (part of SpaceX) is about to absolutely destroy VSAT and turn it to 💩.

TLDR --Strategy-- since you can't invest in SpaceX (private company) or Starlink (until it is spun off into a separate entity **and then DO invest there** ) I think someone that decides to buy PUTS on VSAT (give yourself A LOT of time, I'm talking June 2022 $35 or Jan 2023 $25) stands to make a lot of money ------ I'm personally not starting my position until right before the next earnings report in August. I figure the first sign of trouble will come out in an earnings report and if it isn't August then by November it'll start showing. Again **LONG** duration puts. Looking to catch that cycle when the company drops 50% on the bad news. If it goes up between now and then I'll just buy MORE puts. 

**NOT A PROFESSIONAL FINANCIAL PERSON - INVEST AT YOUR OWN RISK - I THINK THIS MAKES SENSE BUT I MAY BE 🤪🤪🤪🤪 PERSON WHO EATS 💩 FOR ALL YOU KNOW**

details

**ViaSat - How it started**

Market cap of 3.26 Billion, share price of $47.55 when I'm writing this. It got as high as the 90's before the pandemic book the shins out of the market and dropped it to $28. Since recovered a bit to... as I said $47.55

They have some satellites in space that allow people with a receiver dish to get internet from space like some kind of awesome scifi movie.... except the internet is crazy expensive for what you get. Their satellites are pretty high up and that means each one can cover a BIG area. They only seem to have a handful, maybe a dozen? But they offer pretty broad coverage and are expanding it. BUT because the satellites are high up the latency (time between your computer and your internet source or something like that) is high leading to slow speeds and overall not a great service.

They already have airlines as customers, expanding recently with Delta. Their is VERY LITTLE competition in this business and between airlines, cruise lines and rural home owners with no other option they make a nice amount of money. Totally solid business model. Internet is ever more and more important and usage on air planes and boats is only gonna go up. In fact like a lot of articles on VSAT I would probably say this is a good medium / long term buy and that is why the median price target is $67 ***EXCEPT*** I know something that the market doesn't seem to have realized yet.

>EDITED BASED ON COMMENTS

>However, while a viable company may exist beyond the coming reckoning I expect the market to react extremely negatively to ViaSat losing **ALL** of their rural residential and rural small and medium size business customers. I'm also thinking that right around the time that starts sinking in news stories about cruise lines and air lines switching over to StarLink will start popping up and again, $VSAT go **💩.** I honestly hope VSAT does go up to the current target of the mid $60's because I'll start buying puts a small chunk at a time as it rises. Until then I'm waiting till August, right before next quarterly earnings report to start my position.

**StarLink - How it's going**

as you may the Dogefather happens to have a small 🚀 company. Its called SpaceX and they aren't publicly traded. They also are doing to the aerospace / orbit supply and transport industry what many of us wish Tesla could fully due to the fossil fuel industry. SpaceX's Falcon9 🚀 is all sorts of amazing - mainly because it isn't thrown out after each use ($40MM in savings for each subsequent use of a booster).

StarLink is a division of SpaceX that is focused on bringing internet to the whole 🌎 using a crazy amount of satellites. Like... A LOT. Unlike ViaSat which has a few the StarLink constellation (thats what they call a network of satellites) has 16 HUNDRED and they are launching 60 at a time every week or so (sometimes more than once a week). Because StarLink has access to this game changing super cheap 🚀 transportation AND Musk is doing is usual weirdness by mass producing these satellites and focusing on cost and volume instead of making them SUPER DUPER reliable

\*Memes took over. Congrats to the Apes who played the memes.

# TA Notes: 

* Bulls couldn't even overcome the test of 419.64. We reached a high of 419.61.
* This was listed as a small test possibility in last night's post.
* We bounced from the 20 SMMA on the 65m intraday.

# 5/27 Outlook

Today's price 🎯 still hold for tomorrow. *(theta starting to take away some of my credibility if I have to keep moving these targets back...)*

Note from [Spot Gamma](https://spotgamma.com/): *""We are looking for another low volatility session tomorrow with 4200 being the key area in play. Low VIX/implied vol could start to add a tailwind to equities as options decay and dealers buy back short hedges.""*

Could positive unemployment numbers and leading economic index reading give SPY the tailwind it needs to reach ATH?

* If 420.73 breaks, look for bullish 🎯 : 422.43 - 423.81 - 425.15
* If 417.25 breaks, look for bearish 🎯 : 416 - 415 - 414.13 - 412.74 - 411.26 - 410
* Please not that if we push below 415 we could see downwards pressure to 405.

Performance can only be measured through the entire cycle.    The entire Cycle exposes you from all angles. 

The human brain tends to become infected with greed at the end of a big Stage 2 run (see digital  virtuals  for current example) thus causing people to lose money after a bull market because they expect it to go on forever.

  Understanding Stage Analysis can help you overcome this  

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bw41ugsodj171.png?width=490&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b63e3098a3c451ed5536be730650feb79008527

So now let's  dig in our today's post and my targets  : 

1-  Silver will enjoy huge capital flows from those digital assets  holders in a time after overcame and understand stage analysis .... who will now seek the silver whale! 

&#x200B;

2- We are in stage 2 for silver  !!! We can expect parabolic moves any time .  

 Opportunity of buying silver cheap and timely is about to end. 

 Silver has never failed to reach it's ALL-TIME highs after gold does it first.  ( gold did it 2020 July ) 

So, it's not a questions of IF... but WHEN?  

Tic Toc !

&#x200B;

3-  Silver is in a position of strength. US Dollar is in a position of weakness. 

 The final 15% decline in the US Dollar index WILL send silver parabolic!

&#x200B;

4-  The ""silver"" macro tidal wave is picking up steam &will crush all price suppression along the way...  Q2 close will set the stage how fast the insanity picks up.  HOLD ON TIGHT! Easy 56$ and 120$ targets 

This is not financial advice . I hold 1700 ozz of physical silver .",nlt5x7,Understanding Stage Analysis and ready for big explosive moves !

Im just saying this cuz people think it's funny to repeat the same joke just turning it up a notch. That's not cool imo. What started as getting a tattoo has now grew into actual crimes (shitting on your employee's /boss's desk.). Things usually escalate slowly but we don't want to reach that no return. 

So please make the escalation positive. Start something new. Im saying this in all seriousness. Many people joke around and dont realise that a small action could change around someone's day or even their life.

3435,,2021-05-26 23:30:49,t3_nlugr7,,wallstreetbets,"CNBC’s Jim Cramer said Wednesday he’s not sure why any investors are still betting against GameStop and AMC Entertainment, two of the so-called meme stocks popular on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum.
.
.
The “Mad Money” host made his comments following a session in which GameStop shares rose almost 16% Wednesday and AMC advanced 19%. The stocks are up 37% and more than 60%, respectively, this week alone as the speculative trading that took first Wall Street by storm in January resumed.
.
.
“Anyone shorting AMC or GameStop is out of their mind. ... WallStreetBets is too powerful and trying to bet against them right now is just giving them more ammo,” Cramer said.
.
.
Despite some optimism around a potential turnaround spearheaded by Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen, Cramer contended the video-game retailer GameStop remains way overvalued. AMC — which still faces headwinds from the rise of digital streaming — is also expensive at current levels, Cramer said.
.
.
But Cramer the companies are not trading based on fundamentals, which makes shorting their stocks dangerous as long as they remain beloved by Reddit traders.
.
.
Shorting a stock is essentially a bet that it will fall in price. An investor such as a hedge fund borrows shares and then immediately sells them into the market, with the goal of buying them back later at a lower level. Then, the investor returns the borrowed shares, profiting off the price differential.
.
.
When the opposite happens and the stock rises in value, a short-seller may seek to minimize losses by purchasing shares at their higher price.
.
.
Both GameStop and AMC have over 20% of their float shares sold short, according to data from S3 Partners. That’s compared with an average of 5% short interest in a typical U.S. stock.
.
“I’ve never seen anything like this: a group of buyers with no sensitivity to price,” Cramer said. “These people don’t have unlimited firepower, but they’ve got enough firepower to engineer a short-squeeze any time a bunch of professionals decide to bet against this thing.”
.

“These people don’t have unlimited firepower…”

Shares are borrowed, and shares represent legal ownership in a company; previously companies issued stock certificates with your name on it that proved legal ownership.  When you buy shares, you own the shares.  As an owner, you may lend your shares to short-sellers for a fee.  I believe the US laws sees stock as ""Personal Property""  ([https://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/legal-definition-of-personal-property.html#:\~:text=The%20legal%20definition%20of%20personal%20property%20is%20%E2%80%9Canything%20besides%20land,personal%20property%3A%20tangible%20and%20intangible](https://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/legal-definition-of-personal-property.html#:~:text=The%20legal%20definition%20of%20personal%20property%20is%20%E2%80%9Canything%20besides%20land,personal%20property%3A%20tangible%20and%20intangible). )  Shorts who don't cover face margin calls and even bankruptcy, which is typically why they cover, not because of legal obligations, but I'd imagine if your shares were not returned to you, then you must sue to get them back.  Going thru bankruptcy, however, may lead to the legal obligation to repay their debt - for example, liquidating assets, an asset being anything in the short-seller's possession that can be turned into cash (stock, bonds, office equipment etc.).",,

Sup, WSB folks!

It’s Roman here with my Technical ANALysis, remember me? I’m the guy who [put the beard on the line, stating that GME is heading at least to thousands](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/), soon, and my beard is doing well so far, as you may see. Furthermore, recently I did [AMC TA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfaizr/amc_looking_juicy_next_resistance_targets_1623/), and it got to [CBS fucking news](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/)! Btw, the first major resistance there of $16 has been broken already, $20 is the next one and the things are going according to the forecast.

Congrats to AMC hodlers, but today we’ll take a look at the superior stonk‘s current TA state, discussing how things might play out in the shorter term perspective.

The first thing to take a look at this [GME](https://imgur.com/a/eAxaHhE) chart, is the beautiful Bollinger Bands setup. Bollinger Bands is a powerful TA instrument, used by traders for the purpose of identifying potential support and resistance zones, as well as a trend direction. Furthermore, BB is a helpful tool to work with the volatility, as price action‘s fluctuations are taken as a cornerstone measurement for the Bollinger channels. As you should be able to see on the chart, with the volatility in Jan, Feb and Mar the BB channel looks thick (just as your BF’s GF’s ass). Since the beginning of April, though, the consolidation is obvious, and the channel consequently has been narrowing down. But BOOM, the breakout happened yesterday followed by the conformational solidly looking gap today. The setup of a very similar nature crystallized in January too (highlighted blue) and it is easy to see what happened afterwards. Juicy, what else can I say.

MACD. The thing points up, indicating the bullish momentum, with all of the threes indicators (MACD, Signal and Histogram) being on the bullish territory and accelerating with the current price action.

And the most important factor to 🐻 in mind, resistances. As I mentioned in the title, the Purple Haze ($233) is being tested currently, and to my understanding, this is the most important price level for GME currently (refer to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/) for the explanation). As soon as this one is conquered, $350 and $481 seem to be the next two major resistances on the horizon.

Coronavirus is almost history folks. As the world is slowly opening, and restrictions being lifted (thank you to those who are vaccinated), There's still one last industry that is preparing for take off.

This summer airlines will make a comeback. Sooner rather than later travel will be back on the menu.

The CDC is lifting all restrictions for domestic travel for vaccinated people. It's only a matter of time before more restrictions are lifted.

"" If you [travel in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html), you do not need to get tested before or after travel or self-quarantine after travel.""

[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html)

&#x200B;

Europe is considering opening it's borders to vaccinated people possibly this summer although no date is set.

[https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/)

&#x200B;

Now that the hype of the vaccine has died down and people are seriously getting vaccinated airlines are set to have a comeback.

&#x200B;

Any airline will do fine but I believe that Canadian airlines will have the greatest comeback due to the very low amount of vaccinated citizens right now. As their vaccine rate goes up so will the stock prices of industries that will open up again.

The Canadian population is \~4% fully vaccinated while \~45% of them have had one dose.

[https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a7](https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a7)

&#x200B;

Compared to \~40% fully vaccinated and \~50% with at least one dose in the US

[https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations)

&#x200B;

In a previous post I showed that Air Canada was the best Canadian airline to invest with. They are slowly step laddering up in price. In mid April they received a 5.9 billion dollar bailout from the government which secured their comeback. They are just waiting for restrictions to be lifted and I'm sure they've thought of ways to profit in a post-pandemic world.

&#x200B;

Whether you invest in airlines by paying for a fun experience, or by buying their stock, either way many people are going to give their money to airlines this summer. The question is which side will you be on?

Goodluck ladies and gents

&#x200B;

**TL;DR Airlines will make a comeback as restrictions lift. Canada still has a low vax population so the good news for them will cause greater surges in airline stock prices. I know many people who want to travel but few who want to buy stock.**",nlmxyt,How to profit from the final stages of Coronavirus

4411,,2021-05-26 17:48:02,t3_nlmzdx,,wallstreetbets,"Hello fellow WSB degens,

I will be outlining for you today why RIOT and MARA even after today's run up will continue on a meteoric rise.

Firstly the price is currently in the mid 20's for each stonk. This makes sense because back in Jan 2021 the prices of both stonks were in the mid 20's because a certain underlying asset these stonks are based on was trading at 40k and is currently trading once again at 40k. I will refer to this asset during this post as CUA for the rest of this post (certain underlying asset) disclaimer for mods this whole post does not really involve CUA going up or down it is based off of several factors that lead me to believe these specific stonks are undervalued at their current prices even if CUA goes down further. I am forced to mention CUA to explain this reasoning.

Now the fact these stonks are both in the mid $20's like they were back in Jan 2021 no longer makes sense when you factor in that RIOT has tripled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment and MARA has doubled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment. This is akin to a gold mine discovering there just so happened to be double or triple the amount of gold they previously thought was in their mine, or Amazon AWS buying 2-3 times more servers to rent out if AWS could somehow guarantee clients for all those servers 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year. More mining equipment = more revenue. You can tell this is starting to get realized because even though CUA is down today (26-5-21) both of these stonks are up double digits.

As if the above was not reason enough to think these stonks could reasonably 2x or 3x even without an increase in the price of CUA please continue reading.

Now on to China banning CUA mining in China. China controls 65% of the total hash rate of CUA. If China were to stop mining CUA this would bring down the total hash rate of CUA significantly. This would be very good for any and all remaining CUA miners as the CUA difficulty would also drop by 65%. 

To help you autists understand I will compare this to pizza. (Sorry I couldnt think of how to make this analogy with tendies)

If you have 1 pizza and 10 people and you wish to split the pizza equally you would slice the pizza into 10 slices and give everyone 1 slice. This is how CUA mining works. Now imagine that China currently takes 6.5 pieces of pizza but Chinese government is going to tell Chinese citizens they can no longer legally eat pizza in China. Now the rest of the world gets to split those 6.5 pieces of pizza amongst themselves equally. 

Personally I am too retarded to actually do the math to see how this would change MARA and RIOT revenue but it might be as simple as increasing all of their profit by 65%? Not sure. Maybe you divide 65 by 35 and then add that number (1.8) to all the other miners.

The above was all concrete reasoning on why these stonks are both undervalued, but theres a literally shitton of undervalued stonks and there are plenty of retarded overpriced stonks too who is to say that any of the above reasoning matters and the people will care? Theres a lot of stonks bottom line. What is my catalyst for believing these stonks will continue to see momentum and provide tendies?

The below is my retarded opinion and autist forecast into what will occur and provide said tendies to anyone who wishes to participate in the upside of these stocks.

The large majority if not all of this past correction in CUA price can be chalked up to China and Elon. Elon recently tweeted that he no longer liked CUA due to the process of mining being ""dirty"" this is because China controls 65% of the entire hash rate of CUA and China uses the most coal for energy of any country in the world. Elon has now tweeted that he will be meeting with miners in North America to discuss this fact and allow the miners to refute. What Elon will discover is that it is highly unprofitable to mine CUA on electricity deriving from non renewable energy sources as renewable energy sources are the cheapest. The vast majority of large mining operations in North America utilize hydropower RIOT and MARA both use hydropower too. The next thing that Elon will discover is that while China uses more coal for energy than any other country they also use more hydro for energy than any other country. China leads the world in hydroelectricity by any and all metrics including number of dams, sizes of dams, total output of individual dams, total output of all dams, etc. Mining on coal energy is stupid because it is the most expensive energy to produce of any energy. Seeing as how CUA miners only have to pay for internet and electricity bills and internet doesnt really matter cheap electricity makes or breaks their business. Literally RIOT and MARA have 8 employees and 3 employees according to Robinhood. The only bill/cost they care about is electric cost and they want that to be as cheap as possible which will always be renewable energy sources.

Personally I am of the belief that this is all part of Great Daddy Elon's master plan. He pretended to side with the environmentally friendly activists who advocate against CUA mining. This brought global attention to the issue and now he will unveil that he was wrong and this is not the case because mining is all green renewable energy. Great Daddy Elon is never wrong remember that. Elon has even stated things to the contrary of his recent tweet against CUA before when he talked about oil and coal energy subsidies in the US. Just remember that the gooberment says they want more green energy yet they heavily subsidize oil, gas, and coal energy. Until 2023 if you start an oil, gas, or coal energy project the government will subsidize for you to do so to the tune of financing 80-100 percent of the project. Yes that is right. That green stuff is a lie because the peak subsidy for solar projects was 33% and its now like 26%. Great Daddy Elon knows this because Great Daddy Elon knows all as he is the one who told us this.

4412,,2021-05-26 18:08:33,t3_nlnghi,,wallstreetbets,"TLDR: The entire ecosystem surrounding Energy Fuels is primed to make it a cornerstone US REE/Uranium company. Currently sitting under a 1B market cap - it is a ticking time 'bomb'.

The below will give short thesis in each market factor surrounding Energy Fuels.

**Uranium Squeeze** \- Unless you've been sitting under a rock over the past year you know that uranium mining around the world has all but dried up due to the low spot price (its not economically viable at the current price to mine uranium). Meaning that the **world wide consumption of uranium is far outpacing the production**. Currently, the low price is sustained by reserves but once these dry up the spot price is likely to rocket up. Energy Fuels is not only sitting on reserves but can start mining within 6 months. The spot price has gone from $28 -> $31 this past month and its anyone's guess when reserves will dry up but it seems to be an inevitability. This reddit post goes more in depth for the 2021 outlook on uranium supply - [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kpjvhs/2021_will_be_an_unforgettable_year_for_uranium/)

**REE** \- Likely the largest and most important development for this company is that Energy Fuels has a road map for a complete USA in-house REE production chain. If you don't know, the REE market is exploding right now due to many new demands in the market/short supply (pls research, not going to cover here). As a case study see MP - which has a **5B market cap compared to < 1B Energy Fuels**. Now MP has to ship their material oversees for processing in China which to the US is slowly being recognized as a serious national security issue. But in walks Energy Fuels which is proposing an end to end supply chain of REE material at its facility in White Mesa, Utah baby. Lets recap, Energy Fuels **is offering not only green energy solutions with uranium but a solution to a national security risk in the REE market.** good shit.

**Monazite vs Bastnaesite and radioactive material** \- Now that you had an intro to MP, lets get to an important detail that will allow Energy Fuels to take on the REE market quickly and effectively with an inherent advantage. MP produces REE material through the mining of Bastnaesite. However, Monazite ore (which is mined by Energy Fuels for uranium) is richer in rare earths. Ok but why then would MP not simply mine Monzanite???? Its because its radioactive and in the US, there are ungodly amounts of red tape/restrictions around the stuff which basically **makes it impossible to get a new permit to handle it.** But guess who already has one due to its uranium mining - god damn Energy Fuels which means they have already have their source material in line and ready to go with an advantage in REE richness - they just have to figure out processing which brings me to the next point. Not to mention the same material can be leverage for more uranium!

See the chart below to compare the two ores (the REE market us said to only really depend on 4 critical elements - Nd neodymium, Eu europium, Tb terbium, Dy dysprosium) [source](https://www.mining.com/the-only-five-rare-earth-elements-that-matter/)

https://preview.redd.it/s6s8qwy39i171.png?width=1412&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7d910feb79393f4fe0de5fad54e89f5bead4c39

**Financials** \- Feel free to check this dd yourself but Energy Fuels is **debt free** with **$40 million in liquid cash** that they have already said is going towards developing the REE pipeline. They have the source material, they are already mining it, and now they are building the US based processing for it :)

**History** **(\*this is more speculative)** \- Energy Fuels (as the uranium market is cyclical) has gone through huge up and down swings as seen below in 2007 and 2011. We are seeing the start of the run up. Hard to say if REE will provide stability to the chart but no reason to not jump on this coming spike

EDIT: short TLDR by u/turnerdhr23 

"" The shorts doubled up in May, from 11 million shares in April to 18.5 million shares in May. Up over 50% from April short numbers. They are trying everything they can, but you can’t fight buybacks, dividend on 6/9, inclusion in MSCI and Russell, and technicals switching to bullish. They are paying insane 70%+ interest on borrowed shares too. It’s a perfect storm. Got my popcorn ready. ""

Price action has been very nice the last few days with shorts climbing as price does steadily aswell. Approximately 20%+ of the float is being shorted according to TD. Also with this run up you bet your ass they are all in the red. Like I said in my last post, the company is currently buying back shares as of last week - so the float is likely smaller reported making the short % even higher.

With ex dividend coming up on 6/9 (match made in heaven) these shorts are sweating bricks because they know they need to cover or they will have to pay out that dividend for each share shorted on a losing position. As you are seeing towards the end of today they were trying to dump the price - likely done with even more shorts probably with the idea once they dump it enough they can cover this shit position and run. Chart below shows how its almost impossible for any short to be in the green.

DO NOT SELL HERE - the pump hasn't even started to begin Wall ST shits on the company because it was a SPAC so they shorted the fuck out of it and have been having a cash fiesta since the merger crashing the price down to laughable numbers.

Execute contracts if possible - I dont think there are enough shares out there to cover all these positions

TLDR: UWMC over shorted and they will have no choice to cover or pay out the dividend by 6/9 unless they can crash the price by shorting more.... Sounds familiar

Positions: shit load of shares, 8/20 $6 calls that will be executed before ex dividend. 8/20 $7 calls, the cheap play that i just loaded on are the 6/18 $9 calls. DO AS YOU WISH SHARES WILL WIN NO MATTER WHAT BUT PROVIDE LESS TENDIES",nlpfk9,UWMC Margin Warfare 2: Cover or pay me

\- 2017 resulted in 650 coffee shop locations, growing to 8500 retail and 10,000 coffee locations at the start of 2021

\- The Starbucks CEO has taken stake and pushed the product in it's stores.

\- It faces competition from brands like Planet Oat which is sold at locations like Dunkin Donuts. 

\- Investors include Jay-Z, who has recently been seated on the board of Square in 2021

\- The S-1 mentions competition in cashew and hemp meaning potential possibilities to expand into other cream based or protein powder style markets similar to Cola's expansion into variant beverages. It currently exists in yogurt and some cream markets already (more on this later)

\- Revenues have grown over 100% in the past year.

\- The company faces several lawsuits in Europe around branding with the name ""milk"", which marks the company as a legitimate disruptor in the industry. You may see the Oatly sold as ""Wow no cow!"" in some locations as a countertroll to the effort, meaning that the leadership is pretty ballsy.

\- The company posts losses mostly as a function of growth and aggressive marketting spend.

\- Women **strongly** drive this market, which is inline with other market trends related to women's education and household spending growth.

\- The industry growth in general is very strong and is on a path to upend most plant-based drinks that have had first mover advantage. This is an interesting counterpoint to the idea that the product will be commoditized when it can be a multiple-winner situation for organizations like Trader Joes, restaurants, Walmart, and Costco.

[Some additional CONTENT, for this discussion.](https://preview.redd.it/31xgrjieti171.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=0726ab6cbf236f0325c28f975193854062ef3d46)

**My Thoughts**

Anyway I've noticed none of you apes are talking about Oatly here which is crazy to say the least since this is a god tier $BECKY play. But then again you invest in Beyond and TTCF which are basically low tier products in the plant based world that are pushed by suits who have no idea wtf good quality plant-based foods are and would rather depend on first moving gimmicks. At least that's my opinion after being on a plant based diet for a decade.

Oatly is some good shit, top quality stuff. Beyond and Impossible still have a way to go to MEAT high quality standards, but tbh Oatly is definitely there with respect to substituting the deliciousness of milk and dairy based foods/desert. This is also interesting in the inclusivity sense as many consumers of the world are lactose intolerant. Many restaurants benefit from serving the best quality oat milk over a generic brand in the same vein that restaurants benefit from selling Pepsi and Coca Cola products.

What I'll be paying attention with Oatly GROUP while I read the S-1 will be how they view the general plant based market. If I see that leadership is looking ahead at markets like Cashew based creams or fermented cashew cheeses then it's all systems go for me. I mean these freaks already put oil in their milk so I wouldn't be surprised to see it. In some ways Oatly kind of reminds me of Coca Cola's ability to expand in beverage markets.

Trust me in the past 10 years, the vegan cheese and cooking game has definitely evolved and it is not terribly reliant on low tier substitutes like Daiya anymore.

Alright that's my useless rambling on the subject. Hopefully it engages you and we can discuss more about it.

Black berry’s forward revenue will be dominated by two things. Cylance, their cyber security software, and IVY and QNX, their vehicle data hub. Let’s start with IVY and QNX

QNX is a software for vehicles to compartmentalize all their software and data. It’s essentially an operating system for smart cars. It is currently in 175 million vehicles, with more being added every day. Any company without proprietary software (almost all of them besides Tesla) rely on QNX to run their cars’ software 

IVY is a software that reads and organizes vehicle sensor data being picked up by QNX. This is a software in the process of being rolled out, that will create the early stages of a third party self driving solution for any car company without a proprietary self driving software (almost all of them besides Tesla.) With neural networks, which are what are used to make cars self drive, data is king, and you need a lot of it. It will not be an easy thing for car companies to build themselves. And when it comes time to compete with Tesla’s self driving cars, they’ll all be clamoring for IVY

Cylance - Blackberry Cylance is an AI driven anti virus software. It’s confusing, but the gist is that there are many variations of the same virus, most being one time use and have never been seen before, and AI anti virus is needed to detect and stop all the variations. Cylance has been able to stop the attack used by dark side, the hack that brought down the colonial pipeline, since 2015

Deep Fucking Value - black berry is currently trading with a market cap of 4.8 billion dollars. It’s cash on hand is $739 million. Bringing the market cap to $4 billion. It also has 38,000 patents, some of which are in the process of being sold to Facebook for potentially 1-2 billion dollars. On the low end of these patent sales, this puts the market cap at $3 billion.

That’s $3 billion dollars for a key cog in the self driving pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) a key cog in the smart car pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) and a key player in the cyber security industry (a $250 billion dollar industry)

TLDR --Premise-- ViaSat, Inc (VSAT) is a mediocre company that provides mediocre satellite service that costs way too much for what it is.... but in many places it is the ONLY option... well it was until Mr. 🚀 himself decided to eat their lunch. StarLink (part of SpaceX) is about to absolutely destroy VSAT and turn it to 💩.

TLDR --Strategy-- since you can't invest in SpaceX (private company) or Starlink (until it is spun off into a separate entity **and then DO invest there** ) I think someone that decides to buy PUTS on VSAT (give yourself A LOT of time, I'm talking June 2022 $35 or Jan 2023 $25) stands to make a lot of money ------ I'm personally not starting my position until right before the next earnings report in August. I figure the first sign of trouble will come out in an earnings report and if it isn't August then by November it'll start showing. Again **LONG** duration puts. Looking to catch that cycle when the company drops 50% on the bad news. If it goes up between now and then I'll just buy MORE puts. 

**NOT A PROFESSIONAL FINANCIAL PERSON - INVEST AT YOUR OWN RISK - I THINK THIS MAKES SENSE BUT I MAY BE 🤪🤪🤪🤪 PERSON WHO EATS 💩 FOR ALL YOU KNOW**

details

**ViaSat - How it started**

Market cap of 3.26 Billion, share price of $47.55 when I'm writing this. It got as high as the 90's before the pandemic book the shins out of the market and dropped it to $28. Since recovered a bit to... as I said $47.55

They have some satellites in space that allow people with a receiver dish to get internet from space like some kind of awesome scifi movie.... except the internet is crazy expensive for what you get. Their satellites are pretty high up and that means each one can cover a BIG area. They only seem to have a handful, maybe a dozen? But they offer pretty broad coverage and are expanding it. BUT because the satellites are high up the latency (time between your computer and your internet source or something like that) is high leading to slow speeds and overall not a great service.

They already have airlines as customers, expanding recently with Delta. Their is VERY LITTLE competition in this business and between airlines, cruise lines and rural home owners with no other option they make a nice amount of money. Totally solid business model. Internet is ever more and more important and usage on air planes and boats is only gonna go up. In fact like a lot of articles on VSAT I would probably say this is a good medium / long term buy and that is why the median price target is $67 ***EXCEPT*** I know something that the market doesn't seem to have realized yet.

>EDITED BASED ON COMMENTS  
>  
>ViaSat does have commercial business beyond airlines and cruises; I would imagine rural businesses and some VERY LARGE corporations that use it for specific use cases. There is also the DOD which they have contracts with.

>**I AM NOT ASSERTING THAT VIA SAT WILL GO COMPLETELY OUT OF BUSINESS.**  
>  
>  
>  
>However, while a viable company may exist beyond the coming reckoning I expect the market to react extremely negatively to ViaSat losing **ALL** of their rural residential and rural small and medium size business customers. I'm also thinking that right around the time that starts sinking in news stories about cruise lines and air lines switching over to StarLink will start popping up and again, $VSAT go **💩.** I honestly hope VSAT does go up to the current target of the mid $60's because I'll start buying puts a small chunk at a time as it rises. Until then I'm waiting till August, right before next quarterly earnings report to start my position.

**StarLink - How it's going**

as you may the Dogefather happens to have a small 🚀 company. Its called SpaceX and they aren't publicly traded. They also are doing to the aerospace / orbit supply and transport industry what many of us wish Tesla could fully due to the fossil fuel industry. SpaceX's Falcon9 🚀 is all sorts of amazing - mainly because it isn't thrown out after each use ($40MM in savings for each subsequent use of a booster).

StarLink is a division of SpaceX that is focused on bringing internet to the whole 🌎 using a crazy amount of satellites. Like... A LOT. Unlike ViaSat which has a few the StarLink constellation (thats what they call a network of satellites) has 16 HUNDRED and they are launching 60 at a time every week or so (sometimes more than once a week). Because StarLink has access to this game changing super cheap 🚀 transportation AND Musk is doing is usual weirdness by mass producing these satellites and focusing on cost and volume instead of making them SUPER DUPER reliable

Some of you may remember how TSLA was this tiny company that was prob gonna die etc. etc. and THEN 💥💥 there are Model 3's and Model Y's EVERYWHERE. Well StarLink is gonna have that moment soon. Sometime in the next few months there will suddenly be high-ish speed internet (between 50mbs and 100mbs) literally ANYWHERE on the planet for $500 down and $100 a month. Way better product and on an annualized basis way better value.",nlsu85,First real post on WSB - found a walking zombie 🧟 and wanted to share... I bring you a tale of.... $VSAT

Performance can only be measured through the entire cycle.    The entire Cycle exposes you from all angles. 

The human brain tends to become infected with greed at the end of a big Stage 2 run (see digital  virtuals  for current example) thus causing people to lose money after a bull market because they expect it to go on forever.

  Understanding Stage Analysis can help you overcome this  

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bw41ugsodj171.png?width=490&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b63e3098a3c451ed5536be730650feb79008527

So now let's  dig in our today's post and my targets  : 

1-  Silver will enjoy huge capital flows from those digital assets  holders in a time after overcame and understand stage analysis .... who will now seek the silver whale! 

&#x200B;

2- We are in stage 2 for silver  !!! We can expect parabolic moves any time .  

 Opportunity of buying silver cheap and timely is about to end. 

 Silver has never failed to reach it's ALL-TIME highs after gold does it first.  ( gold did it 2020 July ) 

So, it's not a questions of IF... but WHEN?  

Tic Toc !

&#x200B;

3-  Silver is in a position of strength. US Dollar is in a position of weakness. 

 The final 15% decline in the US Dollar index WILL send silver parabolic!

&#x200B;

4-  The ""silver"" macro tidal wave is picking up steam &will crush all price suppression along the way...  Q2 close will set the stage how fast the insanity picks up.  HOLD ON TIGHT! Easy 56$ and 120$ targets 

This is not financial advice . I hold 1700 ozz of physical silver .",nlt5x7,Understanding Stage Analysis and ready for big explosive moves !

4459,,2021-05-26 23:30:49,t3_nlugr7,,wallstreetbets,"CNBC’s Jim Cramer said Wednesday he’s not sure why any investors are still betting against GameStop and AMC Entertainment, two of the so-called meme stocks popular on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum.
.
.
The “Mad Money” host made his comments following a session in which GameStop shares rose almost 16% Wednesday and AMC advanced 19%. The stocks are up 37% and more than 60%, respectively, this week alone as the speculative trading that took first Wall Street by storm in January resumed.
.
.
“Anyone shorting AMC or GameStop is out of their mind. ... WallStreetBets is too powerful and trying to bet against them right now is just giving them more ammo,” Cramer said.
.
.
Despite some optimism around a potential turnaround spearheaded by Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen, Cramer contended the video-game retailer GameStop remains way overvalued. AMC — which still faces headwinds from the rise of digital streaming — is also expensive at current levels, Cramer said.
.
.
But Cramer the companies are not trading based on fundamentals, which makes shorting their stocks dangerous as long as they remain beloved by Reddit traders.
.
.
Shorting a stock is essentially a bet that it will fall in price. An investor such as a hedge fund borrows shares and then immediately sells them into the market, with the goal of buying them back later at a lower level. Then, the investor returns the borrowed shares, profiting off the price differential.
.
.
When the opposite happens and the stock rises in value, a short-seller may seek to minimize losses by purchasing shares at their higher price.
.
.
Both GameStop and AMC have over 20% of their float shares sold short, according to data from S3 Partners. That’s compared with an average of 5% short interest in a typical U.S. stock.
.
“I’ve never seen anything like this: a group of buyers with no sensitivity to price,” Cramer said. “These people don’t have unlimited firepower, but they’ve got enough firepower to engineer a short-squeeze any time a bunch of professionals decide to bet against this thing.”
.

I don’t want to share with you something that you all heard so many times (yep, I haven't lost my fate in humanity) like avoid margin trading or invest in mutual funds. I believe I have some wisdom I wish I had from the beginning. 

1. Trading is just 5% theory and 95% about emotional control, risk and money management, overcoming one’s greed, having strict stoploss and targets predefined before taking a trade. 
2. Don’t follow advice from forums blindly. Build your own map of the world. Each of us learn to trade at our own pace and don’t get discouraged if you find that after a few years, you’re still struggling to master the ‘money game’. You can keep in mind different advice for experienced players (e.g. I recommend this qooore app and it's discord community), *but it's vital for the final decision to be yours*.
3. Accept losses and do not make investment decisions based on emotion Especially greed, fear, or panic. Yep, you didn’t buy Betcoin (lol couldn't resist) at 3,000$ because you didn’t know back than what direction the price would take. No regrets. Keep yourself focused on here and now, move ahead
4. Know yourself. What is your current financial situation? Why you are investing? For what purpose the investment is being made? This will automatically answers questions such as how long you are investing for. The other important aspect is how much risk you would normally want to take. Keeping both in mind, assess your risk carefully.
5. Never forget that for investing, time is your best friend - and greed is your worst enemy. Patience is a requirement in stock trading. There are no short-cuts or ‘holy grail’ when it comes to stock. And you only need to have couple of strategies but those should be well tested and made perfect over the period of time.

To me, trading is a skill that requires 3Ls - ‘Life-Long Learning”.

Stay humble, be honest and willing to admit your mistakes in trading and don’t try to rationalise and explain mistakes away, and always remain teachable and never think you’ve ‘arrived’.",nlvay0,After 3 years of learning investment: my 5 tips for those who just started

It could go up and they don’t give a fuck and still might not even cover. Stocks go up with more buyers than sellers. Sometimes stocks go up 10% in a day and it has nothing to do with a squeeze.

If that's what you want, set your trigger at $240 and your limit at $217.

Then if it dips to 240, your broker will execute a limit order at 217, and you'll get the best price it can find you as long as that price is 21 or higher. Then when it recovers and rips, you won't get any of the tendies, just like you want. 🧻🤲 can get off the rocket.

Coronavirus is almost history folks. As the world is slowly opening, and restrictions being lifted (thank you to those who are vaccinated), There's still one last industry that is preparing for take off.

This summer airlines will make a comeback. Sooner rather than later travel will be back on the menu.

The CDC is lifting all restrictions for domestic travel for vaccinated people. It's only a matter of time before more restrictions are lifted.

"" If you [travel in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html), you do not need to get tested before or after travel or self-quarantine after travel.""

[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html)

&#x200B;

Europe is considering opening it's borders to vaccinated people possibly this summer although no date is set.

[https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/)

&#x200B;

Now that the hype of the vaccine has died down and people are seriously getting vaccinated airlines are set to have a comeback.

&#x200B;

Any airline will do fine but I believe that Canadian airlines will have the greatest comeback due to the very low amount of vaccinated citizens right now. As their vaccine rate goes up so will the stock prices of industries that will open up again.

The Canadian population is \~4% fully vaccinated while \~45% of them have had one dose.

[https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a7](https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a7)

&#x200B;

Compared to \~40% fully vaccinated and \~50% with at least one dose in the US

[https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations)

&#x200B;

In a previous post I showed that Air Canada was the best Canadian airline to invest with. They are slowly step laddering up in price. In mid April they received a 5.9 billion dollar bailout from the government which secured their comeback. They are just waiting for restrictions to be lifted and I'm sure they've thought of ways to profit in a post-pandemic world.

&#x200B;

Whether you invest in airlines by paying for a fun experience, or by buying their stock, either way many people are going to give their money to airlines this summer. The question is which side will you be on?

Goodluck ladies and gents

&#x200B;

**TL;DR Airlines will make a comeback as restrictions lift. Canada still has a low vax population so the good news for them will cause greater surges in airline stock prices. I know many people who want to travel but few who want to buy stock.**",nlmxyt,How to profit from the final stages of Coronavirus

5655,,2021-05-26 17:48:02,t3_nlmzdx,,wallstreetbets,"Hello fellow WSB degens,

I will be outlining for you today why RIOT and MARA even after today's run up will continue on a meteoric rise.

Firstly the price is currently in the mid 20's for each stonk. This makes sense because back in Jan 2021 the prices of both stonks were in the mid 20's because a certain underlying asset these stonks are based on was trading at 40k and is currently trading once again at 40k. I will refer to this asset during this post as CUA for the rest of this post (certain underlying asset) disclaimer for mods this whole post does not really involve CUA going up or down it is based off of several factors that lead me to believe these specific stonks are undervalued at their current prices even if CUA goes down further. I am forced to mention CUA to explain this reasoning.

Now the fact these stonks are both in the mid $20's like they were back in Jan 2021 no longer makes sense when you factor in that RIOT has tripled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment and MARA has doubled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment. This is akin to a gold mine discovering there just so happened to be double or triple the amount of gold they previously thought was in their mine, or Amazon AWS buying 2-3 times more servers to rent out if AWS could somehow guarantee clients for all those servers 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year. More mining equipment = more revenue. You can tell this is starting to get realized because even though CUA is down today (26-5-21) both of these stonks are up double digits.

As if the above was not reason enough to think these stonks could reasonably 2x or 3x even without an increase in the price of CUA please continue reading.

Now on to China banning CUA mining in China. China controls 65% of the total hash rate of CUA. If China were to stop mining CUA this would bring down the total hash rate of CUA significantly. This would be very good for any and all remaining CUA miners as the CUA difficulty would also drop by 65%. 

To help you autists understand I will compare this to pizza. (Sorry I couldnt think of how to make this analogy with tendies)

If you have 1 pizza and 10 people and you wish to split the pizza equally you would slice the pizza into 10 slices and give everyone 1 slice. This is how CUA mining works. Now imagine that China currently takes 6.5 pieces of pizza but Chinese government is going to tell Chinese citizens they can no longer legally eat pizza in China. Now the rest of the world gets to split those 6.5 pieces of pizza amongst themselves equally. 

Personally I am too retarded to actually do the math to see how this would change MARA and RIOT revenue but it might be as simple as increasing all of their profit by 65%? Not sure. Maybe you divide 65 by 35 and then add that number (1.8) to all the other miners.

The above was all concrete reasoning on why these stonks are both undervalued, but theres a literally shitton of undervalued stonks and there are plenty of retarded overpriced stonks too who is to say that any of the above reasoning matters and the people will care? Theres a lot of stonks bottom line. What is my catalyst for believing these stonks will continue to see momentum and provide tendies?

The below is my retarded opinion and autist forecast into what will occur and provide said tendies to anyone who wishes to participate in the upside of these stocks.

The large majority if not all of this past correction in CUA price can be chalked up to China and Elon. Elon recently tweeted that he no longer liked CUA due to the process of mining being ""dirty"" this is because China controls 65% of the entire hash rate of CUA and China uses the most coal for energy of any country in the world. Elon has now tweeted that he will be meeting with miners in North America to discuss this fact and allow the miners to refute. What Elon will discover is that it is highly unprofitable to mine CUA on electricity deriving from non renewable energy sources as renewable energy sources are the cheapest. The vast majority of large mining operations in North America utilize hydropower RIOT and MARA both use hydropower too. The next thing that Elon will discover is that while China uses more coal for energy than any other country they also use more hydro for energy than any other country. China leads the world in hydroelectricity by any and all metrics including number of dams, sizes of dams, total output of individual dams, total output of all dams, etc. Mining on coal energy is stupid because it is the most expensive energy to produce of any energy. Seeing as how CUA miners only have to pay for internet and electricity bills and internet doesnt really matter cheap electricity makes or breaks their business. Literally RIOT and MARA have 8 employees and 3 employees according to Robinhood. The only bill/cost they care about is electric cost and they want that to be as cheap as possible which will always be renewable energy sources.

Personally I am of the belief that this is all part of Great Daddy Elon's master plan. He pretended to side with the environmentally friendly activists who advocate against CUA mining. This brought global attention to the issue and now he will unveil that he was wrong and this is not the case because mining is all green renewable energy. Great Daddy Elon is never wrong remember that. Elon has even stated things to the contrary of his recent tweet against CUA before when he talked about oil and coal energy subsidies in the US. Just remember that the gooberment says they want more green energy yet they heavily subsidize oil, gas, and coal energy. Until 2023 if you start an oil, gas, or coal energy project the government will subsidize for you to do so to the tune of financing 80-100 percent of the project. Yes that is right. That green stuff is a lie because the peak subsidy for solar projects was 33% and its now like 26%. Great Daddy Elon knows this because Great Daddy Elon knows all as he is the one who told us this.

5656,,2021-05-26 18:08:33,t3_nlnghi,,wallstreetbets,"TLDR: The entire ecosystem surrounding Energy Fuels is primed to make it a cornerstone US REE/Uranium company. Currently sitting under a 1B market cap - it is a ticking time 'bomb'.

The below will give short thesis in each market factor surrounding Energy Fuels.

**Uranium Squeeze** \- Unless you've been sitting under a rock over the past year you know that uranium mining around the world has all but dried up due to the low spot price (its not economically viable at the current price to mine uranium). Meaning that the **world wide consumption of uranium is far outpacing the production**. Currently, the low price is sustained by reserves but once these dry up the spot price is likely to rocket up. Energy Fuels is not only sitting on reserves but can start mining within 6 months. The spot price has gone from $28 -> $31 this past month and its anyone's guess when reserves will dry up but it seems to be an inevitability. This reddit post goes more in depth for the 2021 outlook on uranium supply - [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kpjvhs/2021_will_be_an_unforgettable_year_for_uranium/)

**REE** \- Likely the largest and most important development for this company is that Energy Fuels has a road map for a complete USA in-house REE production chain. If you don't know, the REE market is exploding right now due to many new demands in the market/short supply (pls research, not going to cover here). As a case study see MP - which has a **5B market cap compared to < 1B Energy Fuels**. Now MP has to ship their material oversees for processing in China which to the US is slowly being recognized as a serious national security issue. But in walks Energy Fuels which is proposing an end to end supply chain of REE material at its facility in White Mesa, Utah baby. Lets recap, Energy Fuels **is offering not only green energy solutions with uranium but a solution to a national security risk in the REE market.** good shit.

**Monazite vs Bastnaesite and radioactive material** \- Now that you had an intro to MP, lets get to an important detail that will allow Energy Fuels to take on the REE market quickly and effectively with an inherent advantage. MP produces REE material through the mining of Bastnaesite. However, Monazite ore (which is mined by Energy Fuels for uranium) is richer in rare earths. Ok but why then would MP not simply mine Monzanite???? Its because its radioactive and in the US, there are ungodly amounts of red tape/restrictions around the stuff which basically **makes it impossible to get a new permit to handle it.** But guess who already has one due to its uranium mining - god damn Energy Fuels which means they have already have their source material in line and ready to go with an advantage in REE richness - they just have to figure out processing which brings me to the next point. Not to mention the same material can be leverage for more uranium!

See the chart below to compare the two ores (the REE market us said to only really depend on 4 critical elements - Nd neodymium, Eu europium, Tb terbium, Dy dysprosium) [source](https://www.mining.com/the-only-five-rare-earth-elements-that-matter/)

https://preview.redd.it/s6s8qwy39i171.png?width=1412&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7d910feb79393f4fe0de5fad54e89f5bead4c39

**Financials** \- Feel free to check this dd yourself but Energy Fuels is **debt free** with **$40 million in liquid cash** that they have already said is going towards developing the REE pipeline. They have the source material, they are already mining it, and now they are building the US based processing for it :)

**History** **(\*this is more speculative)** \- Energy Fuels (as the uranium market is cyclical) has gone through huge up and down swings as seen below in 2007 and 2011. We are seeing the start of the run up. Hard to say if REE will provide stability to the chart but no reason to not jump on this coming spike

EDIT: short TLDR by u/turnerdhr23 

"" The shorts doubled up in May, from 11 million shares in April to 18.5 million shares in May. Up over 50% from April short numbers. They are trying everything they can, but you can’t fight buybacks, dividend on 6/9, inclusion in MSCI and Russell, and technicals switching to bullish. They are paying insane 70%+ interest on borrowed shares too. It’s a perfect storm. Got my popcorn ready. ""

Price action has been very nice the last few days with shorts climbing as price does steadily aswell. Approximately 20%+ of the float is being shorted according to TD. Also with this run up you bet your ass they are all in the red. Like I said in my last post, the company is currently buying back shares as of last week - so the float is likely smaller reported making the short % even higher.

With ex dividend coming up on 6/9 (match made in heaven) these shorts are sweating bricks because they know they need to cover or they will have to pay out that dividend for each share shorted on a losing position. As you are seeing towards the end of today they were trying to dump the price - likely done with even more shorts probably with the idea once they dump it enough they can cover this shit position and run. Chart below shows how its almost impossible for any short to be in the green.

DO NOT SELL HERE - the pump hasn't even started to begin Wall ST shits on the company because it was a SPAC so they shorted the fuck out of it and have been having a cash fiesta since the merger crashing the price down to laughable numbers.

THE ADVANTAGE WE HAVE IS OUR AWARENESS OF OUR RETARDATION THESE AUTISTIC HEDGE FUNDS THINK THEY ARE SMART AND CAN CONTROL PA TO ALWAYS WIN. THEY SOMEHOW THINK THAT WE ARE TO PREOCCUPIED WITH AMC AND GME BUT THEY DONT REALISE NO FUND IS SAFE.

Execute contracts if possible - I dont think there are enough shares out there to cover all these positions

TLDR: UWMC over shorted and they will have no choice to cover or pay out the dividend by 6/9 unless they can crash the price by shorting more.... Sounds familiar

Positions: shit load of shares, 8/20 $6 calls that will be executed before ex dividend. 8/20 $7 calls, the cheap play that i just loaded on are the 6/18 $9 calls. DO AS YOU WISH SHARES WILL WIN NO MATTER WHAT BUT PROVIDE LESS TENDIES",nlpfk9,UWMC Margin Warfare 2: Cover or pay me

Black berry’s forward revenue will be dominated by two things. Cylance, their cyber security software, and IVY and QNX, their vehicle data hub. Let’s start with IVY and QNX

QNX is a software for vehicles to compartmentalize all their software and data. It’s essentially an operating system for smart cars. It is currently in 175 million vehicles, with more being added every day. Any company without proprietary software (almost all of them besides Tesla) rely on QNX to run their cars’ software 

IVY is a software that reads and organizes vehicle sensor data being picked up by QNX. This is a software in the process of being rolled out, that will create the early stages of a third party self driving solution for any car company without a proprietary self driving software (almost all of them besides Tesla.) With neural networks, which are what are used to make cars self drive, data is king, and you need a lot of it. It will not be an easy thing for car companies to build themselves. And when it comes time to compete with Tesla’s self driving cars, they’ll all be clamoring for IVY

Cylance - Blackberry Cylance is an AI driven anti virus software. It’s confusing, but the gist is that there are many variations of the same virus, most being one time use and have never been seen before, and AI anti virus is needed to detect and stop all the variations. Cylance has been able to stop the attack used by dark side, the hack that brought down the colonial pipeline, since 2015

Deep Fucking Value - black berry is currently trading with a market cap of 4.8 billion dollars. It’s cash on hand is $739 million. Bringing the market cap to $4 billion. It also has 38,000 patents, some of which are in the process of being sold to Facebook for potentially 1-2 billion dollars. On the low end of these patent sales, this puts the market cap at $3 billion.

TLDR --Premise-- ViaSat, Inc (VSAT) is a mediocre company that provides mediocre satellite service that costs way too much for what it is.... but in many places it is the ONLY option... well it was until Mr. 🚀 himself decided to eat their lunch. StarLink (part of SpaceX) is about to absolutely destroy VSAT and turn it to 💩.

TLDR --Strategy-- since you can't invest in SpaceX (private company) or Starlink (until it is spun off into a separate entity **and then DO invest there** ) I think someone that decides to buy PUTS on VSAT (give yourself A LOT of time, I'm talking June 2022 $35 or Jan 2023 $25) stands to make a lot of money ------ I'm personally not starting my position until right before the next earnings report in August. I figure the first sign of trouble will come out in an earnings report and if it isn't August then by November it'll start showing. Again **LONG** duration puts. Looking to catch that cycle when the company drops 50% on the bad news. If it goes up between now and then I'll just buy MORE puts. 

**NOT A PROFESSIONAL FINANCIAL PERSON - INVEST AT YOUR OWN RISK - I THINK THIS MAKES SENSE BUT I MAY BE 🤪🤪🤪🤪 PERSON WHO EATS 💩 FOR ALL YOU KNOW**

details

**ViaSat - How it started**

Market cap of 3.26 Billion, share price of $47.55 when I'm writing this. It got as high as the 90's before the pandemic book the shins out of the market and dropped it to $28. Since recovered a bit to... as I said $47.55

They have some satellites in space that allow people with a receiver dish to get internet from space like some kind of awesome scifi movie.... except the internet is crazy expensive for what you get. Their satellites are pretty high up and that means each one can cover a BIG area. They only seem to have a handful, maybe a dozen? But they offer pretty broad coverage and are expanding it. BUT because the satellites are high up the latency (time between your computer and your internet source or something like that) is high leading to slow speeds and overall not a great service.

They already have airlines as customers, expanding recently with Delta. Their is VERY LITTLE competition in this business and between airlines, cruise lines and rural home owners with no other option they make a nice amount of money. Totally solid business model. Internet is ever more and more important and usage on air planes and boats is only gonna go up. In fact like a lot of articles on VSAT I would probably say this is a good medium / long term buy and that is why the median price target is $67 ***EXCEPT*** I know something that the market doesn't seem to have realized yet.

>EDITED BASED ON COMMENTS  
>  
>ViaSat does have commercial business beyond airlines and cruises; I would imagine rural businesses and some VERY LARGE corporations that use it for specific use cases. There is also the DOD which they have contracts with.  
>  
>  
>  
>**I AM NOT ASSERTING THAT VIA SAT WILL GO COMPLETELY OUT OF BUSINESS.**  
>  
>  
>  
>However, while a viable company may exist beyond the coming reckoning I expect the market to react extremely negatively to ViaSat losing **ALL** of their rural residential and rural small and medium size business customers. I'm also thinking that right around the time that starts sinking in news stories about cruise lines and air lines switching over to StarLink will start popping up and again, $VSAT go **💩.** I honestly hope VSAT does go up to the current target of the mid $60's because I'll start buying puts a small chunk at a time as it rises. Until then I'm waiting till August, right before next quarterly earnings report to start my position.

**StarLink - How it's going**

as you may the Dogefather happens to have a small 🚀 company. Its called SpaceX and they aren't publicly traded. They also are doing to the aerospace / orbit supply and transport industry what many of us wish Tesla could fully due to the fossil fuel industry. SpaceX's Falcon9 🚀 is all sorts of amazing - mainly because it isn't thrown out after each use ($40MM in savings for each subsequent use of a booster).

StarLink is a division of SpaceX that is focused on bringing internet to the whole 🌎 using a crazy amount of satellites. Like... A LOT. Unlike ViaSat which has a few the StarLink constellation (thats what they call a network of satellites) has 16 HUNDRED and they are launching 60 at a time every week or so (sometimes more than once a week). Because StarLink has access to this game changing super cheap 🚀 transportation AND Musk is doing is usual weirdness by mass producing these satellites and focusing on cost and volume instead of making them SUPER DUPER reliable

Some of you may remember how TSLA was this tiny company that was prob gonna die etc. etc. and THEN 💥💥 there are Model 3's and Model Y's EVERYWHERE. Well StarLink is gonna have that moment soon. Sometime in the next few months there will suddenly be high-ish speed internet (between 50mbs and 100mbs) literally ANYWHERE on the planet for $500 down and $100 a month. Way better product and on an annualized basis way better value.",nlsu85,First real post on WSB - found a walking zombie 🧟 and wanted to share... I bring you a tale of.... $VSAT

Performance can only be measured through the entire cycle.    The entire Cycle exposes you from all angles. 

The human brain tends to become infected with greed at the end of a big Stage 2 run (see digital  virtuals  for current example) thus causing people to lose money after a bull market because they expect it to go on forever.

  Understanding Stage Analysis can help you overcome this  

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bw41ugsodj171.png?width=490&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b63e3098a3c451ed5536be730650feb79008527

So now let's  dig in our today's post and my targets  : 

1-  Silver will enjoy huge capital flows from those digital assets  holders in a time after overcame and understand stage analysis .... who will now seek the silver whale! 

&#x200B;

2- We are in stage 2 for silver  !!! We can expect parabolic moves any time .  

 Opportunity of buying silver cheap and timely is about to end. 

 Silver has never failed to reach it's ALL-TIME highs after gold does it first.  ( gold did it 2020 July ) 

So, it's not a questions of IF... but WHEN?  

Tic Toc !

&#x200B;

3-  Silver is in a position of strength. US Dollar is in a position of weakness. 

 The final 15% decline in the US Dollar index WILL send silver parabolic!

&#x200B;

4-  The ""silver"" macro tidal wave is picking up steam &will crush all price suppression along the way...  Q2 close will set the stage how fast the insanity picks up.  HOLD ON TIGHT! Easy 56$ and 120$ targets 

This is not financial advice . I hold 1700 ozz of physical silver .",nlt5x7,Understanding Stage Analysis and ready for big explosive moves !

5702,,2021-05-26 23:30:49,t3_nlugr7,,wallstreetbets,"CNBC’s Jim Cramer said Wednesday he’s not sure why any investors are still betting against GameStop and AMC Entertainment, two of the so-called meme stocks popular on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum.
.
.
The “Mad Money” host made his comments following a session in which GameStop shares rose almost 16% Wednesday and AMC advanced 19%. The stocks are up 37% and more than 60%, respectively, this week alone as the speculative trading that took first Wall Street by storm in January resumed.
.
.
“Anyone shorting AMC or GameStop is out of their mind. ... WallStreetBets is too powerful and trying to bet against them right now is just giving them more ammo,” Cramer said.
.
.
Despite some optimism around a potential turnaround spearheaded by Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen, Cramer contended the video-game retailer GameStop remains way overvalued. AMC — which still faces headwinds from the rise of digital streaming — is also expensive at current levels, Cramer said.
.
.
But Cramer the companies are not trading based on fundamentals, which makes shorting their stocks dangerous as long as they remain beloved by Reddit traders.
.
.
Shorting a stock is essentially a bet that it will fall in price. An investor such as a hedge fund borrows shares and then immediately sells them into the market, with the goal of buying them back later at a lower level. Then, the investor returns the borrowed shares, profiting off the price differential.
.
.
When the opposite happens and the stock rises in value, a short-seller may seek to minimize losses by purchasing shares at their higher price.
.
.
Both GameStop and AMC have over 20% of their float shares sold short, according to data from S3 Partners. That’s compared with an average of 5% short interest in a typical U.S. stock.
.
“I’ve never seen anything like this: a group of buyers with no sensitivity to price,” Cramer said. “These people don’t have unlimited firepower, but they’ve got enough firepower to engineer a short-squeeze any time a bunch of professionals decide to bet against this thing.”
.

I don’t want to share with you something that you all heard so many times (yep, I haven't lost my fate in humanity) like avoid margin trading or invest in mutual funds. I believe I have some wisdom I wish I had from the beginning.

1. Trading is just 5% theory and 95% about emotional control, risk and money management, overcoming one’s greed, having strict stoploss and targets predefined before taking a trade.
2. Don’t follow advice from forums blindly. Build your own map of the world. Each of us learn to trade at our own pace and don’t get discouraged if you find that after a few years, you’re still struggling to master the ‘money game’. You can keep in mind different advice from experienced players (e.g. I recommend this qooore app and it's discord community), *but it's vital for the final decision to be yours*.
3. Accept losses and do not make investment decisions based on emotion Especially greed, fear, or panic. Yep, you didn’t buy Betcoin (lol couldn't resist) at 3,000$ because you didn’t know back than what direction the price would take. No regrets. Keep yourself focused on here and now, move ahead
4. Know yourself. What is your current financial situation? Why you are investing? For what purpose the investment is being made? This will automatically answers questions such as how long you are investing for. The other important aspect is how much risk you would normally want to take. Keeping both in mind, assess your risk carefully.
5. Never forget that for investing, time is your best friend - and greed is your worst enemy. Patience is a requirement in stock trading. There are no short-cuts or ‘holy grail’ when it comes to stock. And you only need to have couple of strategies but those should be well tested and made perfect over the period of time.

To me, trading is a skill that requires 3Ls - ‘Life-Long Learning”.

Stay humble, be honest and willing to admit your mistakes in trading and don’t try to rationalise and explain mistakes away, and always remain teachable and never think you’ve ‘arrived’.",nlvay0,After 3 years of learning investment: my 5 tips for those who just started

Just study general price action when there are big individual blocks and you’ll understand why that doesn’t mean selling pressure is high. 

Let’s say you want to invest in X stock. All of the metrics look good, it’s been trending up all day at an average pace of $1 per hour, and volume is consistent and decent. If it’s at $13 and you see a block of 100,000 shares at $20. It would be reasonable to assume with all the information that it will go up and pause at $20 until several million dollars are brought to buy those shares (if the day’s trend continues and the metrics stay positive for growth). That’s fantastic ROI—anyone who isn’t an idiot would invest.

Now let’s say the block is instead at $13.50. Would you buy in knowing that with the current volume and the bid/ask price pattern that you would only be up $0.50 a share before potentially bouncing off and heading down? If you were in a stock with high institutional to retail investment ratio then maybe—$0.50 over tens of thousands of shares add up. But what if a large portion of the pride movement is driven by retail (or at least guided by retail) like in meme stocks ? Individual retail buyers don’t have the capital to break a block of that magnitude on their own, thus encouraging holders to sell a little before it hits $20 and discouraging new buyers from investing in the first place—$0.50 gain on 50 shares of a stock with unpredictably high volatility isn’t worth it. And it doesn’t mean they aren’t going to invest, it just means they are waiting for the potential ROI to justify the risk.",,

Their arrogance wouldn’t let them even consider that the Apes might not only hold the line - let alone even consider that they might actually double down because the Apes liked the stock & knew that if they owned the float all they had to do was wait while the HFs & BSDs bleed themselves dry.

I think at this point - Apes probably own quite a bit more than the float which means that a lot of the shorts are going to get rogered & good trying to close out their positions.

Of course, they have to either admit that they lost or go bankrupt for that to happen & as it happens, I grew up in a seriously old money family (*don’t kidnap me, I intentionally got disinherited & now they wouldn’t buy me a cup of coffee, let alone pay a ransom*) so I know exactly how these pigfuckers think & I walked away from all of it because it was toxic as shit.

After the next short report that shows low short interest they’ll short the hell out of it at the top again and dump their shares triggering a retail sell off because the squeeze is over... at least until the next short report and everyone thinks they haven’t learned. They’ve had ample warning and aren’t gonna get caught with their pants down on the same stocks again. I’m sure they’ll be profiting off the retail group think the whole way. May as well just send your money straight to them.,,

Coronavirus is almost history folks. As the world is slowly opening, and restrictions being lifted (thank you to those who are vaccinated), There's still one last industry that is preparing for take off.

This summer airlines will make a comeback. Sooner rather than later travel will be back on the menu.

The CDC is lifting all restrictions for domestic travel for vaccinated people. It's only a matter of time before more restrictions are lifted.

"" If you [travel in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html), you do not need to get tested before or after travel or self-quarantine after travel.""

[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html)

&#x200B;

Europe is considering opening it's borders to vaccinated people possibly this summer although no date is set.

[https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/)

&#x200B;

Now that the hype of the vaccine has died down and people are seriously getting vaccinated airlines are set to have a comeback.

&#x200B;

Any airline will do fine but I believe that Canadian airlines will have the greatest comeback due to the very low amount of vaccinated citizens right now. As their vaccine rate goes up so will the stock prices of industries that will open up again.

The Canadian population is \~4% fully vaccinated while \~45% of them have had one dose.

[https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a7](https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a7)

&#x200B;

Compared to \~40% fully vaccinated and \~50% with at least one dose in the US

[https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations)

&#x200B;

In a previous post I showed that Air Canada was the best Canadian airline to invest with. They are slowly step laddering up in price. In mid April they received a 5.9 billion dollar bailout from the government which secured their comeback. They are just waiting for restrictions to be lifted and I'm sure they've thought of ways to profit in a post-pandemic world.

&#x200B;

Whether you invest in airlines by paying for a fun experience, or by buying their stock, either way many people are going to give their money to airlines this summer. The question is which side will you be on?

Goodluck ladies and gents

&#x200B;

**TL;DR Airlines will make a comeback as restrictions lift. Canada still has a low vax population so the good news for them will cause greater surges in airline stock prices. I know many people who want to travel but few who want to buy stock.**",nlmxyt,How to profit from the final stages of Coronavirus

8182,,2021-05-26 17:48:02,t3_nlmzdx,,wallstreetbets,"Hello fellow WSB degens,

I will be outlining for you today why RIOT and MARA even after today's run up will continue on a meteoric rise.

Firstly the price is currently in the mid 20's for each stonk. This makes sense because back in Jan 2021 the prices of both stonks were in the mid 20's because a certain underlying asset these stonks are based on was trading at 40k and is currently trading once again at 40k. I will refer to this asset during this post as CUA for the rest of this post (certain underlying asset) disclaimer for mods this whole post does not really involve CUA going up or down it is based off of several factors that lead me to believe these specific stonks are undervalued at their current prices even if CUA goes down further. I am forced to mention CUA to explain this reasoning.

Now the fact these stonks are both in the mid $20's like they were back in Jan 2021 no longer makes sense when you factor in that RIOT has tripled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment and MARA has doubled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment. This is akin to a gold mine discovering there just so happened to be double or triple the amount of gold they previously thought was in their mine, or Amazon AWS buying 2-3 times more servers to rent out if AWS could somehow guarantee clients for all those servers 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year. More mining equipment = more revenue. You can tell this is starting to get realized because even though CUA is down today (26-5-21) both of these stonks are up double digits.

As if the above was not reason enough to think these stonks could reasonably 2x or 3x even without an increase in the price of CUA please continue reading.

Now on to China banning CUA mining in China. China controls 65% of the total hash rate of CUA. If China were to stop mining CUA this would bring down the total hash rate of CUA significantly. This would be very good for any and all remaining CUA miners as the CUA difficulty would also drop by 65%. 

To help you autists understand I will compare this to pizza. (Sorry I couldnt think of how to make this analogy with tendies)

If you have 1 pizza and 10 people and you wish to split the pizza equally you would slice the pizza into 10 slices and give everyone 1 slice. This is how CUA mining works. Now imagine that China currently takes 6.5 pieces of pizza but Chinese government is going to tell Chinese citizens they can no longer legally eat pizza in China. Now the rest of the world gets to split those 6.5 pieces of pizza amongst themselves equally. 

Personally I am too retarded to actually do the math to see how this would change MARA and RIOT revenue but it might be as simple as increasing all of their profit by 65%? Not sure. Maybe you divide 65 by 35 and then add that number (1.8) to all the other miners.

The above was all concrete reasoning on why these stonks are both undervalued, but theres a literally shitton of undervalued stonks and there are plenty of retarded overpriced stonks too who is to say that any of the above reasoning matters and the people will care? Theres a lot of stonks bottom line. What is my catalyst for believing these stonks will continue to see momentum and provide tendies?

The below is my retarded opinion and autist forecast into what will occur and provide said tendies to anyone who wishes to participate in the upside of these stocks.

The large majority if not all of this past correction in CUA price can be chalked up to China and Elon. Elon recently tweeted that he no longer liked CUA due to the process of mining being ""dirty"" this is because China controls 65% of the entire hash rate of CUA and China uses the most coal for energy of any country in the world. Elon has now tweeted that he will be meeting with miners in North America to discuss this fact and allow the miners to refute. What Elon will discover is that it is highly unprofitable to mine CUA on electricity deriving from non renewable energy sources as renewable energy sources are the cheapest. The vast majority of large mining operations in North America utilize hydropower RIOT and MARA both use hydropower too. The next thing that Elon will discover is that while China uses more coal for energy than any other country they also use more hydro for energy than any other country. China leads the world in hydroelectricity by any and all metrics including number of dams, sizes of dams, total output of individual dams, total output of all dams, etc. Mining on coal energy is stupid because it is the most expensive energy to produce of any energy. Seeing as how CUA miners only have to pay for internet and electricity bills and internet doesnt really matter cheap electricity makes or breaks their business. Literally RIOT and MARA have 8 employees and 3 employees according to Robinhood. The only bill/cost they care about is electric cost and they want that to be as cheap as possible which will always be renewable energy sources.

Personally I am of the belief that this is all part of Great Daddy Elon's master plan. He pretended to side with the environmentally friendly activists who advocate against CUA mining. This brought global attention to the issue and now he will unveil that he was wrong and this is not the case because mining is all green renewable energy. Great Daddy Elon is never wrong remember that. Elon has even stated things to the contrary of his recent tweet against CUA before when he talked about oil and coal energy subsidies in the US. Just remember that the gooberment says they want more green energy yet they heavily subsidize oil, gas, and coal energy. Until 2023 if you start an oil, gas, or coal energy project the government will subsidize for you to do so to the tune of financing 80-100 percent of the project. Yes that is right. That green stuff is a lie because the peak subsidy for solar projects was 33% and its now like 26%. Great Daddy Elon knows this because Great Daddy Elon knows all as he is the one who told us this.

8183,,2021-05-26 18:08:33,t3_nlnghi,,wallstreetbets,"TLDR: The entire ecosystem surrounding Energy Fuels is primed to make it a cornerstone US REE/Uranium company. Currently sitting under a 1B market cap - it is a ticking time 'bomb'.

The below will give short thesis in each market factor surrounding Energy Fuels.

**Uranium Squeeze** \- Unless you've been sitting under a rock over the past year you know that uranium mining around the world has all but dried up due to the low spot price (its not economically viable at the current price to mine uranium). Meaning that the **world wide consumption of uranium is far outpacing the production**. Currently, the low price is sustained by reserves but once these dry up the spot price is likely to rocket up. Energy Fuels is not only sitting on reserves but can start mining within 6 months. The spot price has gone from $28 -> $31 this past month and its anyone's guess when reserves will dry up but it seems to be an inevitability. This reddit post goes more in depth for the 2021 outlook on uranium supply - [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kpjvhs/2021_will_be_an_unforgettable_year_for_uranium/)

**REE** \- Likely the largest and most important development for this company is that Energy Fuels has a road map for a complete USA in-house REE production chain. If you don't know, the REE market is exploding right now due to many new demands in the market/short supply (pls research, not going to cover here). As a case study see MP - which has a **5B market cap compared to < 1B Energy Fuels**. Now MP has to ship their material oversees for processing in China which to the US is slowly being recognized as a serious national security issue. But in walks Energy Fuels which is proposing an end to end supply chain of REE material at its facility in White Mesa, Utah baby. Lets recap, Energy Fuels **is offering not only green energy solutions with uranium but a solution to a national security risk in the REE market.** good shit.

**Monazite vs Bastnaesite and radioactive material** \- Now that you had an intro to MP, lets get to an important detail that will allow Energy Fuels to take on the REE market quickly and effectively with an inherent advantage. MP produces REE material through the mining of Bastnaesite. However, Monazite ore (which is mined by Energy Fuels for uranium) is richer in rare earths. Ok but why then would MP not simply mine Monzanite???? Its because its radioactive and in the US, there are ungodly amounts of red tape/restrictions around the stuff which basically **makes it impossible to get a new permit to handle it.** But guess who already has one due to its uranium mining - god damn Energy Fuels which means they have already have their source material in line and ready to go with an advantage in REE richness - they just have to figure out processing which brings me to the next point. Not to mention the same material can be leverage for more uranium!

See the chart below to compare the two ores (the REE market us said to only really depend on 4 critical elements - Nd neodymium, Eu europium, Tb terbium, Dy dysprosium) [source](https://www.mining.com/the-only-five-rare-earth-elements-that-matter/)

https://preview.redd.it/s6s8qwy39i171.png?width=1412&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7d910feb79393f4fe0de5fad54e89f5bead4c39

**Financials** \- Feel free to check this dd yourself but Energy Fuels is **debt free** with **$40 million in liquid cash** that they have already said is going towards developing the REE pipeline. They have the source material, they are already mining it, and now they are building the US based processing for it :)

**History** **(\*this is more speculative)** \- Energy Fuels (as the uranium market is cyclical) has gone through huge up and down swings as seen below in 2007 and 2011. We are seeing the start of the run up. Hard to say if REE will provide stability to the chart but no reason to not jump on this coming spike

Kinder Morgan has the largest natural gas transmission network with \~70 thousand miles of natural gas pipelines, 659 bcf of storage capacity, and \~1200 miles of NGL. The company is the largest independent transporter of refiner products \~6800 miles of refined product pipelines and \~3100 miles of crude pipelines.

Kinder Morgan is also the largest independent terminal operator with 144 terminals & 16 Jones Act vessels. These together enabled the company to increase natural gas income during the Texas storm, something that wasn't a one-off. The company is the largest CO2 transporter with \~1.5 bcf/day of capacity, showing its strength.

* Kinder Morgan benefited off of the Texas Storm with its DCF expected to reach almost $6 billion for the year.
* The company has a dividend of almost 6% and it's continuing to invest in its business for the long run.
* The company has an impressive and diverse portfolio of assets which we expect it'll be able to utilize to drive substantial long-term shareholder rewards.

8199,,2021-05-26 19:34:02,t3_nlpfk9,,wallstreetbets,"I must start this with do not touch your AMC for anything let alone a stock that hasnt even cemented itself in this new world - but the memeconemy is having a revival and with Wall St's apparent dislike of this company through shorts I think UWMC may have a nice place in this new order.

EDIT: short TLDR by u/turnerdhr23 

"" The shorts doubled up in May, from 11 million shares in April to 18.5 million shares in May. Up over 50% from April short numbers. They are trying everything they can, but you can’t fight buybacks, dividend on 6/9, inclusion in MSCI and Russell, and technicals switching to bullish. They are paying insane 70%+ interest on borrowed shares too. It’s a perfect storm. Got my popcorn ready. ""

Price action has been very nice the last few days with shorts climbing as price does steadily aswell. Approximately 20%+ of the float is being shorted according to TD. Also with this run up you bet your ass they are all in the red. Like I said in my last post, the company is currently buying back shares as of last week - so the float is likely smaller reported making the short % even higher.

With ex dividend coming up on 6/9 (match made in heaven) these shorts are sweating bricks because they know they need to cover or they will have to pay out that dividend for each share shorted on a losing position. As you are seeing towards the end of today they were trying to dump the price - likely done with even more shorts probably with the idea once they dump it enough they can cover this shit position and run. Chart below shows how its almost impossible for any short to be in the green.

[Also Schwab is telling me this is hard to borrow \(high short float\)](https://preview.redd.it/rbvjtk2zmi171.png?width=944&format=png&auto=webp&s=310642d4e17a29527ee49cc3ec4ec3780840d0c0)

DO NOT SELL HERE - the pump hasn't even started to begin Wall ST shits on the company because it was a SPAC so they shorted the fuck out of it and have been having a cash fiesta since the merger crashing the price down to laughable numbers.

THE ADVANTAGE WE HAVE IS OUR AWARENESS OF OUR RETARDATION THESE AUTISTIC HEDGE FUNDS THINK THEY ARE SMART AND CAN CONTROL PA TO ALWAYS WIN. THEY SOMEHOW THINK THAT WE ARE TO PREOCCUPIED WITH AMC AND GME BUT THEY DONT REALISE NO FUND IS SAFE.

Execute contracts if possible - I dont think there are enough shares out there to cover all these positions

TLDR: UWMC over shorted and they will have no choice to cover or pay out the dividend by 6/9 unless they can crash the price by shorting more.... Sounds familiar

Positions: shit load of shares, 8/20 $6 calls that will be executed before ex dividend. 8/20 $7 calls, the cheap play that i just loaded on are the 6/18 $9 calls. DO AS YOU WISH SHARES WILL WIN NO MATTER WHAT BUT PROVIDE LESS TENDIES",nlpfk9,UWMC Margin Warfare 2: Cover or pay me

Black berry’s forward revenue will be dominated by two things. Cylance, their cyber security software, and IVY and QNX, their vehicle data hub. Let’s start with IVY and QNX

QNX is a software for vehicles to compartmentalize all their software and data. It’s essentially an operating system for smart cars. It is currently in 175 million vehicles, with more being added every day. Any company without proprietary software (almost all of them besides Tesla) rely on QNX to run their cars’ software 

IVY is a software that reads and organizes vehicle sensor data being picked up by QNX. This is a software in the process of being rolled out, that will create the early stages of a third party self driving solution for any car company without a proprietary self driving software (almost all of them besides Tesla.) With neural networks, which are what are used to make cars self drive, data is king, and you need a lot of it. It will not be an easy thing for car companies to build themselves. And when it comes time to compete with Tesla’s self driving cars, they’ll all be clamoring for IVY

Cylance - Blackberry Cylance is an AI driven anti virus software. It’s confusing, but the gist is that there are many variations of the same virus, most being one time use and have never been seen before, and AI anti virus is needed to detect and stop all the variations. Cylance has been able to stop the attack used by dark side, the hack that brought down the colonial pipeline, since 2015

Deep Fucking Value - black berry is currently trading with a market cap of 4.8 billion dollars. It’s cash on hand is $739 million. Bringing the market cap to $4 billion. It also has 38,000 patents, some of which are in the process of being sold to Facebook for potentially 1-2 billion dollars. On the low end of these patent sales, this puts the market cap at $3 billion.

That’s $3 billion dollars for a key cog in the self driving pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) a key cog in the smart car pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) and a key player in the cyber security industry (a $250 billion dollar industry)

TLDR --Premise-- ViaSat, Inc (VSAT) is a mediocre company that provides mediocre satellite service that costs way too much for what it is.... but in many places it is the ONLY option... well it was until Mr. 🚀 himself decided to eat their lunch. StarLink (part of SpaceX) is about to absolutely destroy VSAT and turn it to 💩.

TLDR --Strategy-- since you can't invest in SpaceX (private company) or Starlink (until it is spun off into a separate entity **and then DO invest there** ) I think someone that decides to buy PUTS on VSAT (give yourself A LOT of time, I'm talking June 2022 $35 or Jan 2023 $25) stands to make a lot of money ------ I'm personally not starting my position until right before the next earnings report in August. I figure the first sign of trouble will come out in an earnings report and if it isn't August then by November it'll start showing. Again **LONG** duration puts. Looking to catch that cycle when the company drops 50% on the bad news. If it goes up between now and then I'll just buy MORE puts. 

**NOT A PROFESSIONAL FINANCIAL PERSON - INVEST AT YOUR OWN RISK - I THINK THIS MAKES SENSE BUT I MAY BE 🤪🤪🤪🤪 PERSON WHO EATS 💩 FOR ALL YOU KNOW**

details

**ViaSat - How it started**

Market cap of 3.26 Billion, share price of $47.55 when I'm writing this. It got as high as the 90's before the pandemic book the shins out of the market and dropped it to $28. Since recovered a bit to... as I said $47.55

They have some satellites in space that allow people with a receiver dish to get internet from space like some kind of awesome scifi movie.... except the internet is crazy expensive for what you get. Their satellites are pretty high up and that means each one can cover a BIG area. They only seem to have a handful, maybe a dozen? But they offer pretty broad coverage and are expanding it. BUT because the satellites are high up the latency (time between your computer and your internet source or something like that) is high leading to slow speeds and overall not a great service.

They already have airlines as customers, expanding recently with Delta. Their is VERY LITTLE competition in this business and between airlines, cruise lines and rural home owners with no other option they make a nice amount of money. Totally solid business model. Internet is ever more and more important and usage on air planes and boats is only gonna go up. In fact like a lot of articles on VSAT I would probably say this is a good medium / long term buy and that is why the median price target is $67 ***EXCEPT*** I know something that the market doesn't seem to have realized yet.

>EDITED BASED ON COMMENTS  
>  
>ViaSat does have commercial business beyond airlines and cruises; I would imagine rural businesses and some VERY LARGE corporations that use it for specific use cases. There is also the DOD which they have contracts with.  
>

>**I AM NOT ASSERTING THAT VIA SAT WILL GO COMPLETELY OUT OF BUSINESS.**  
>  
>  
>  
>However, while a viable company may exist beyond the coming reckoning I expect the market to react extremely negatively to ViaSat losing **ALL** of their rural residential and rural small and medium size business customers. I'm also thinking that right around the time that starts sinking in news stories about cruise lines and air lines switching over to StarLink will start popping up and again, $VSAT go **💩.** I honestly hope VSAT does go up to the current target of the mid $60's because I'll start buying puts a small chunk at a time as it rises. Until then I'm waiting till August, right before next quarterly earnings report to start my position.

**StarLink - How it's going**

as you may the Dogefather happens to have a small 🚀 company. Its called SpaceX and they aren't publicly traded. They also are doing to the aerospace / orbit supply and transport industry what many of us wish Tesla could fully due to the fossil fuel industry. SpaceX's Falcon9 🚀 is all sorts of amazing - mainly because it isn't thrown out after each use ($40MM in savings for each subsequent use of a booster).

StarLink is a division of SpaceX that is focused on bringing internet to the whole 🌎 using a crazy amount of satellites. Like... A LOT. Unlike ViaSat which has a few the StarLink constellation (thats what they call a network of satellites) has 16 HUNDRED and they are launching 60 at a time every week or so (sometimes more than once a week). Because StarLink has access to this game changing super cheap 🚀 transportation AND Musk is doing is usual weirdness by mass producing these satellites and focusing on cost and volume instead of making them SUPER DUPER reliable

Some of you may remember how TSLA was this tiny company that was prob gonna die etc. etc. and THEN 💥💥 there are Model 3's and Model Y's EVERYWHERE. Well StarLink is gonna have that moment soon. Sometime in the next few months there will suddenly be high-ish speed internet (between 50mbs and 100mbs) literally ANYWHERE on the planet for $500 down and $100 a month. Way better product and on an annualized basis way better value.",nlsu85,First real post on WSB - found a walking zombie 🧟 and wanted to share... I bring you a tale of.... $VSAT

Performance can only be measured through the entire cycle.    The entire Cycle exposes you from all angles. 

The human brain tends to become infected with greed at the end of a big Stage 2 run (see digital  virtuals  for current example) thus causing people to lose money after a bull market because they expect it to go on forever.

  Understanding Stage Analysis can help you overcome this  

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bw41ugsodj171.png?width=490&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b63e3098a3c451ed5536be730650feb79008527

So now let's  dig in our today's post and my targets  : 

1-  Silver will enjoy huge capital flows from those digital assets  holders in a time after overcame and understand stage analysis .... who will now seek the silver whale! 

&#x200B;

2- We are in stage 2 for silver  !!! We can expect parabolic moves any time .  

 Opportunity of buying silver cheap and timely is about to end. 

 Silver has never failed to reach it's ALL-TIME highs after gold does it first.  ( gold did it 2020 July ) 

So, it's not a questions of IF... but WHEN?  

Tic Toc !

&#x200B;

8228,,2021-05-26 23:30:49,t3_nlugr7,,wallstreetbets,"CNBC’s Jim Cramer said Wednesday he’s not sure why any investors are still betting against GameStop and AMC Entertainment, two of the so-called meme stocks popular on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum.
.
.
The “Mad Money” host made his comments following a session in which GameStop shares rose almost 16% Wednesday and AMC advanced 19%. The stocks are up 37% and more than 60%, respectively, this week alone as the speculative trading that took first Wall Street by storm in January resumed.
.
.
“Anyone shorting AMC or GameStop is out of their mind. ... WallStreetBets is too powerful and trying to bet against them right now is just giving them more ammo,” Cramer said.
.
.
Despite some optimism around a potential turnaround spearheaded by Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen, Cramer contended the video-game retailer GameStop remains way overvalued. AMC — which still faces headwinds from the rise of digital streaming — is also expensive at current levels, Cramer said.
.
.
But Cramer the companies are not trading based on fundamentals, which makes shorting their stocks dangerous as long as they remain beloved by Reddit traders.
.
.
Shorting a stock is essentially a bet that it will fall in price. An investor such as a hedge fund borrows shares and then immediately sells them into the market, with the goal of buying them back later at a lower level. Then, the investor returns the borrowed shares, profiting off the price differential.
.
.
When the opposite happens and the stock rises in value, a short-seller may seek to minimize losses by purchasing shares at their higher price.
.
.
Both GameStop and AMC have over 20% of their float shares sold short, according to data from S3 Partners. That’s compared with an average of 5% short interest in a typical U.S. stock.
.
“I’ve never seen anything like this: a group of buyers with no sensitivity to price,” Cramer said. “These people don’t have unlimited firepower, but they’ve got enough firepower to engineer a short-squeeze any time a bunch of professionals decide to bet against this thing.”
.
.
“These people don’t have unlimited firepower…”

I don’t want to share with you something that you all heard so many times (yep, I haven't lost my fate in humanity) like avoid margin trading or invest in mutual funds. I believe I have some wisdom I wish I had from the beginning.

1. Trading is just 5% theory and 95% about emotional control, risk and money management, overcoming one’s greed, having strict stoploss and targets predefined before taking a trade.
2. Don’t follow advice from forums blindly. Build your own map of the world. Each of us learn to trade at our own pace and don’t get discouraged if you find that after a few years, you’re still struggling to master the ‘money game’. You can keep in mind different advice from experienced players (e.g. I recommend this qooore app and it's discord community), *but it's vital for the final decision to be yours*.
3. Accept losses and do not make investment decisions based on emotion Especially greed, fear, or panic. Yep, you didn’t buy Betcoin (lol couldn't resist) at 3,000$ because you didn’t know back than what direction the price would take. No regrets. Keep yourself focused on here and now, move ahead
4. Know yourself. What is your current financial situation? Why you are investing? For what purpose the investment is being made? This will automatically answers questions such as how long you are investing for. The other important aspect is how much risk you would normally want to take. Keeping both in mind, assess your risk carefully.
5. Never forget that for investing, time is your best friend - and greed is your worst enemy. Patience is a requirement in stock trading. There are no short-cuts or ‘holy grail’ when it comes to stock. And you only need to have couple of strategies but those should be well tested and made perfect over the period of time.

To me, trading is a skill that requires 3Ls - ‘Life-Long Learning”.

Stay humble, be honest and willing to admit your mistakes in trading and don’t try to rationalise and explain mistakes away, and always remain teachable and never think you’ve ‘arrived’.",nlvay0,After 3 years of learning investment: my 5 tips for those who just started

8241,,2021-05-27 01:00:08,t3_nlw3ty,,wallstreetbets,"Hi Everyone! I did some research on cinema stocks a while back and made a video on it. I didn't post the content here so I thought I would share it as I know everyone is interested in AMC at the moment! I know it's a lot to read so if you prefer to watch the video, the link for that is also included below:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRNn2bOC1xo&t=6s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRNn2bOC1xo&t=6s)

Why Cinema Stocks like AMC will benefit from reopening? 

Time-Frame: Cinema’s will benefit from reopening and the economic recovery that is occurring all over the world. Especially over a longer timeframe.  I think that Cinemas can be a good trade in the medium term and can help you make money. It’s all dependent on data and how quickly things go back to normal, but my timeframe on this trade right now is 1-2 years. Maybe even shorter, perhaps 6 months if we bounce back very quickly. Maybe not the most likely, but still a possible scenario that I have to consider. 

&#x200B;

Thesis: 

1)  The Covid-19 pandemic has had a very strong negative impact on the cinema sector. So, naturally as things reopen and vaccinations increase all over North America, these companies stand to benefit. If we look back from the end of January 2020 to the end of April 2021, Marcus Corporation was down approximately 33% from January 27th, 2020. Cinemark is down approximately 35% over the same time period, while National CineMedia is down almost 42% and AMC is up almost 57%. Price is an important factor to consider when buying and selling stocks and this something that is important to consider 

2) Cinemas have suffered tremendously with the Covid-19 pandemic, which makes the cinema sector intriguing as the world re-opens. If we look to Asia, especially China and Japan, where Covid-19 cases subsided and theatres reopened, things look promising.  There was a substantial increase in demand, with demand actually higher than pre-pandemic levels. In China, December 2020 ticket sales at IMAX’s big-screen theatres jumped 28 per cent from a year earlier, while in Japan, they broke daily records and a record number of people saw movies on the first weekend of January 2021. Clearly, there was a lot of pent-up demand which surfaced and benefitted movie theatres in Asia. 

3) And you know what I’ve seen this film before. Last year early in February, there was a sudden spike in downloads of the Zoom app in China, and the stock at that was point already doing well, up roughly 30 percent from the start of the year. But this spike in Zoom usage soon spread all over the world, and the rest is history. It was an absolutely humungous winner last year. There are obviously sector wide risks with consumer preferences changing, and more and more people preferring to watch films at home. The increase in Netflix & streaming service subscribers over the years is a clear indication of consumer preferences going-forward, but I do like movie theatres as a trade. There is a lot of pent-up demand that I feel will benefit the sector. 

Risks: 

\-  One of the main risks that that most people who are considering trading or investing in cinema companies have, is the risk from Netflix and the other streaming services. Really the risk of the Direct-to-consumer approach and the effects that it will have on the cinema companies. And this is a valid concern because it has reduced demand for cinemas over the last decade. Even some of the biggest filmmakers in the world are turning to it, like Martin Scorsese, Noah Baumbach and Alfonso Cuaron.  Netflix has become the biggest movie studio in the world, at-least when it comes to volume in terms of production over the last several years. And now they plan to release 50-60 films per year, and with their pioneering Direct to Consumer approach, the film industry has changed. Cinemas are no longer at the forefront, and the Direct-to-Consumer strategy is quickly becoming the new incumbent. The DTC approach is taking over, with all the streaming services that have launched. They have taken market share from linear television and have steered consumers away from traditional Cinema.

Catalysts & Conclusion: 

1) However, I still think there is still a place for theatres, even with streaming, especially looking at the same timeframe that I’m focusing on for this trade. I think now more so than ever people want to be outside. These businesses will benefit from the change in near term consumer trends, with everyone wanting to leave the house. I really believe that the cinema sector is going to do well in North America. If Asia is anything to go by and I think it is, some of the companies involved in the sector have the potential to be great trades. People still want to go to the cinemas, especially when it comes to seeing some of the big budget films that are really made for the big screen. Blockbuster action films with awesome effects are really meant to be seen in a movie theatre in my opinion. The effects and the environment simply cannot be replicated at home. Especially when it comes to immersive experience films, like those with IMAX and 4DX. I really enjoy the cinema and think there is something to be said for being in a big space in a dark room watching a film 40 feet across. It is wonderful to sit in the comfort of your own home but there is just something to be said for having a community experience in a room. But that’s neither there nor here. 

  
2) Moving on, another potential catalyst is the potential for collaboration between theatre chains and streaming services. Netflix was the one to pioneer the Direct to Consumer, but interestingly they have begun releasing some Netflix Originals on the big screen in recent years. Films like The Irishman, Marriage Story and The Two Popes all premiered in Cinemas prior to their appearance in Netflix’s online catalogue.  This is a really interesting move on their part, especially from an investment perspective. Because, while you can watch streaming services in the comfort of your own home, movie theatre companies are open to the idea of having the films that are produced by the streaming services shown in their theatres. Cinemark has shown Netflix movies in theatres in the past, and there is an off chance that they expand their agreement. This wouldn’t just apply to Cinemark but other theatre chains as well potentially. The big hold-up between the streaming services and theatre chains was the disagreement on the length of theatrical window. But last year, Universal Studios and Cinemark, AMC & Cineplex agreed to a shortened exclusive window, from 74 days to 31 days for major films, as defined by box-office domestic revenue. This makes it more likely that Netflix and other streaming services can find middle ground with the cinema companies. It’s not all that important a catalyst for the trade, nor is it all that likely, but it is still intriguing and something to consider.

3) A more important catalyst is the release of the next James Bond film, no time to die next year. I’m really excited about the movie because I’m a huge James Bond fan. It’s probably my favourite movie series. And you know what, I’m not alone. It’s very popular all over the world. The previous James Bond film, Spectre, grossed nearly $879 million. No Time To Die has been postponed several times due to the pandemic and is due to premiere on October 8th in the United States. I’m really excited about the movie and will be sure to see in theatres provided it’s safe to do so. And I think it will be. This movie is really important for the movie theatres because they have been starved and there have just been very few films to show. They have been supply constrained with the lack of new films. No Time To Die is a certain blockbuster and will really help benefit the sector. 

4) Something else that has me really excited is the recent CDC news in the US, with them updating guidance on April 2nd that fully vaccinated people can travel internationally safely and don’t need to quarantine when they return provided, they test negative within three to five days of their return. They have to test negative before they are allowed to board a return flight to the US. This is really exciting, and this combined with the idea of a vaccine passport as has been proposed by cruise lines and the UK government really provide a lot of momentum for the cinema companies.

Since GME has been trading sideways, the premiums allowed me to collect about a 100% gain over the past 2 months. Over time I grew dissatisfied with these gains as I am greedy.

On May 12, I visited r/thetagangbets to seek extra theta gains, since the actual thetagang people are happy with 1% monthly returns and wouldn’t recommend any strategies that provide good growth (again, I’m money hungry so 1% does not satisfy me). After consulting the greatest minds of Reddit, I decided to sell naked calls in addition to my covered calls. Usually I sell 2 calls on my 200 shares. This time I sold an additional 10 May 28 150C for $9.6, without any shares backing them. I happily collected my $9,600, as I figured it would be free money. Over the next couple weeks I happily took my theta decay from the buyers. The past three days, things have changed for the worst.

In my view the following points are justifiable:
-The VW emissions hack was not an effort to destroy the environment. 
-It was trolling done by VW officials bc they were tired of having the EPA’s pozzed dick in their asses regarding diesel emission regulations on diesel imports. 
-VW was tired of the EPA because:

     A.  In europe diesel autos make up over half of    
           all car engines. 
     B.  Cars like the Euro-version VW golf wagon      
           get almost 90 mpg. Compare that to the 
           Toyota Prius that gets 40mpg at best. 
     C.  The EPA doesnt want VW to import a 90    
           MPG diesel car to the US because it would    
           kill US auto sales, so the EPA makes diesel 
           regulations so strict that the only diesels 
           VW et. al. can import only manage 45 MPG. 
     D.  And if you want to make things fair, the 
           highest MPG diesel electric hybrid made by 
           VW gets over 200 MPG. 
     E.  Europeans aren’t idiots: they aren’t willingly 
          “poisoning themselves” with diesel fumes. 
          Diesel is just as clean as gas and burning 
          1 gallon of diesel fuel every 90 miles is 
          better for the environment than burning 1 
          gallon of gas every 30 miles. 
     F.  The “smelly/black fume producing” 
          reputation of diesel in america owes itself to 
          idiot US auto makers that in the 80’s tried to 
          make frankenstein diesel engines out of 
          modified gas engines and they ran like shit 
          and spewed black smoke. These atrocities    
          were unlike the clean running diesel engines 
          that were being produced in Germany at the 
          same time. 
-In summary, the EPA has been punishing European Auto makers (VW) for American auto makers’ past engineering disgraces, and when VW officials got tired of being unfairly punished they decided to troll the EPA with an emissions hack. 
-They did it to slam some jimmies, not to gain      
profit or destroy the environment. 
-German authorities know this, which is why they released key players like Oliver Schmidt who was let out on parole right after he was transferred from US prison to German authorities. 
-The loss of stock value that occured from the scandal was unjustified then, and the stagnation of VW stock price since then has been unjustified in light of the fact that VW’s P/E in the last 3 months has been between 50-70 times lower than that of Tesla, and historically it has been foolish to underestimate the ability of Volkswagen to perform at the cutting edge of the industry. 
-The Emissions hack has nothing negative to say about Volkswagens fierce engineering capability and in my view it has something positive to say about the youthfulness and creativity of the company.

This is a real game-changing technology which can offer a real alternative with an interchangeable battery technology for the existing lithium-ion batteries in almost every application with GMG’s Graphene and UQ’s patent-pending aluminum ion battery technology. The current nominal voltage of our batteries is 1.7 volts, and work is being carried out to increase the voltage to directly replace existing batteries and which lead to higher energy densities.

The real differentiator about these batteries is their very high power density of up to 7000 watts/kg, which endows them with a very high charge rate. Furthermore, graphene aluminum-ion batteries provide major benefits in terms of longer battery life (over 2000 charge / discharge cycles testing so far with no deterioration in performance), battery safety (very low fire potential) and lower environmental impact (more recyclable).

**What I'm doing**: Averaging in slowly in preparation for the 10D EMA to come in in preparation for another leg higher.

Market

* **The RPA Market is growing rapidly**: GVR estimates the global robotic process automation market to grow at 34% CAGR through 2028 while Gartner estimates it to grow at over 24% YoY CAGR - to $600B, through 2022 ([source](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-04-28-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-hyperautomation-enabling-software-market-to-reach-nearly-600-billion-by-2022)) and expects $PATH to grow at 33% CAGR ([source](https://www.uipath.com/resources/automation-analyst-reports/gartner-magic-quadrant-robotic-process-automation))
* **$PATH dominates the most important regions for RPA**: North America (accounts for 37% of global RPA spend ([source](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/robotic-process-automation-rpa-market)) and as of January 31, 2021, $PATH had 7,968 customers, including 80% of the Fortune 10 and 63% of the Fortune Global 500 ([source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521125014/d98556d424b4.htm#rom98556_9))

Company & Financials

* **$PATH can expect high levels of current customer retention**: UiPath has an NPS (Net Promoter Score) of 71 over the past 12 mo period, lightyears beyond the industry average of 39 ([Source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521125014/d98556d424b4.htm#rom98556_4), [Source](https://www.retently.com/blog/good-net-promoter-score/))
* **Strong revenue growth:** $PATH is experiencing YoY Revenue growth of over 80%
* **Strong profitability growth:** While $PATH grows revenues at over 80% YoY, their cost of revenue only grows at \~13% YoY. EBITDA Margin is growing at 88% YoY - $PATH will begin capturing large profits in the next year ([source](https://app.koyfin.com/fa/fa.is/eq-08u9m6))

Sup, WSB folks!

It’s Roman here with my Technical ANALysis, remember me? I’m the guy who [put the beard on the line, stating that GME is heading at least to thousands](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/), soon, and my beard is doing well so far, as you may see. Furthermore, recently I did [AMC TA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfaizr/amc_looking_juicy_next_resistance_targets_1623/), and it got to [CBS fucking news](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/)! Btw, the first major resistance there of $16 has been broken already, $20 is the next one and the things are going according to the forecast.

Congrats to AMC hodlers, but today we’ll take a look at the superior stonk‘s current TA state, discussing how things might play out in the shorter term perspective.

The first thing to take a look at this [GME](https://imgur.com/a/eAxaHhE) chart, is the beautiful Bollinger Bands setup. Bollinger Bands is a powerful TA instrument, used by traders for the purpose of identifying potential support and resistance zones, as well as a trend direction. Furthermore, BB is a helpful tool to work with the volatility, as price action‘s fluctuations are taken as a cornerstone measurement for the Bollinger channels. As you should be able to see on the chart, with the volatility in Jan, Feb and Mar the BB channel looks thick (just as your BF’s GF’s ass). Since the beginning of April, though, the consolidation is obvious, and the channel consequently has been narrowing down. But BOOM, the breakout happened yesterday followed by the conformational solidly looking gap today. The setup of a very similar nature crystallized in January too (highlighted blue) and it is easy to see what happened afterwards. Juicy, what else can I say.

MACD. The thing points up, indicating the bullish momentum, with all of the threes indicators (MACD, Signal and Histogram) being on the bullish territory and accelerating with the current price action.

And the most important factor to 🐻 in mind, resistances. As I mentioned in the title, the Purple Haze ($233) is being tested currently, and to my understanding, this is the most important price level for GME currently (refer to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/) for the explanation). As soon as this one is conquered, $350 and $481 seem to be the next two major resistances on the horizon.

I hope, that you enjoyed this little piece of TA, have a great day! 

(and compulsory not a fin advise and fuck you!)",nlmlev,"Daym it feels good to be a GME hodler in times like these! Take a look at this sweet TA picture: Bollinger Bands are boilin', MACD(onalds) pointing north... And the Purple Haze is being tested! How do you like this, Wen Moon?"

This is a real game-changing technology which can offer a real alternative with an interchangeable battery technology for the existing lithium-ion batteries in almost every application with GMG’s Graphene and UQ’s patent-pending aluminum ion battery technology. The current nominal voltage of our batteries is 1.7 volts, and work is being carried out to increase the voltage to directly replace existing batteries and which lead to higher energy densities.

The real differentiator about these batteries is their very high power density of up to 7000 watts/kg, which endows them with a very high charge rate. Furthermore, graphene aluminum-ion batteries provide major benefits in terms of longer battery life (over 2000 charge / discharge cycles testing so far with no deterioration in performance), battery safety (very low fire potential) and lower environmental impact (more recyclable).

**What I'm doing**: Averaging in slowly in preparation for the 10D EMA to come in in preparation for another leg higher.

Market

* **The RPA Market is growing rapidly**: GVR estimates the global robotic process automation market to grow at 34% CAGR through 2028 while Gartner estimates it to grow at over 24% YoY CAGR - to $600B, through 2022 ([source](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-04-28-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-hyperautomation-enabling-software-market-to-reach-nearly-600-billion-by-2022)) and expects $PATH to grow at 33% CAGR ([source](https://www.uipath.com/resources/automation-analyst-reports/gartner-magic-quadrant-robotic-process-automation))
* **$PATH dominates the most important regions for RPA**: North America (accounts for 37% of global RPA spend ([source](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/robotic-process-automation-rpa-market)) and as of January 31, 2021, $PATH had 7,968 customers, including 80% of the Fortune 10 and 63% of the Fortune Global 500 ([source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521125014/d98556d424b4.htm#rom98556_9))

Company & Financials

* **$PATH can expect high levels of current customer retention**: UiPath has an NPS (Net Promoter Score) of 71 over the past 12 mo period, lightyears beyond the industry average of 39 ([Source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521125014/d98556d424b4.htm#rom98556_4), [Source](https://www.retently.com/blog/good-net-promoter-score/))

Sup, WSB folks!

It’s Roman here with my Technical ANALysis, remember me? I’m the guy who [put the beard on the line, stating that GME is heading at least to thousands](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/), soon, and my beard is doing well so far, as you may see. Furthermore, recently I did [AMC TA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfaizr/amc_looking_juicy_next_resistance_targets_1623/), and it got to [CBS fucking news](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/)! Btw, the first major resistance there of $16 has been broken already, $20 is the next one and the things are going according to the forecast.

Congrats to AMC hodlers, but today we’ll take a look at the superior stonk‘s current TA state, discussing how things might play out in the shorter term perspective.

The first thing to take a look at this [GME](https://imgur.com/a/eAxaHhE) chart, is the beautiful Bollinger Bands setup. Bollinger Bands is a powerful TA instrument, used by traders for the purpose of identifying potential support and resistance zones, as well as a trend direction. Furthermore, BB is a helpful tool to work with the volatility, as price action‘s fluctuations are taken as a cornerstone measurement for the Bollinger channels. As you should be able to see on the chart, with the volatility in Jan, Feb and Mar the BB channel looks thick (just as your BF’s GF’s ass). Since the beginning of April, though, the consolidation is obvious, and the channel consequently has been narrowing down. But BOOM, the breakout happened yesterday followed by the conformational solidly looking gap today. The setup of a very similar nature crystallized in January too (highlighted blue) and it is easy to see what happened afterwards. Juicy, what else can I say.

MACD. The thing points up, indicating the bullish momentum, with all of the threes indicators (MACD, Signal and Histogram) being on the bullish territory and accelerating with the current price action.

And the most important factor to 🐻 in mind, resistances. As I mentioned in the title, the Purple Haze ($233) is being tested currently, and to my understanding, this is the most important price level for GME currently (refer to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/) for the explanation). As soon as this one is conquered, $350 and $481 seem to be the next two major resistances on the horizon.

I hope, that you enjoyed this little piece of TA, have a great day! 

(and compulsory not a fin advise and fuck you!)",nlmlev,"Daym it feels good to be a GME hodler in times like these! Take a look at this sweet TA picture: Bollinger Bands are boilin', MACD(onalds) pointing north... And the Purple Haze is being tested! How do you like this, Wen Moon?"

Coronavirus is almost history folks. As the world is slowly opening, and restrictions being lifted (thank you to those who are vaccinated), There's still one last industry that is preparing for take off.

This summer airlines will make a comeback. Sooner rather than later travel will be back on the menu.

The CDC is lifting all restrictions for domestic travel for vaccinated people. It's only a matter of time before more restrictions are lifted.

"" If you [travel in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html), you do not need to get tested before or after travel or self-quarantine after travel.""

[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html)

&#x200B;

Europe is considering opening it's borders to vaccinated people possibly this summer although no date is set.

[https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/)

&#x200B;

Now that the hype of the vaccine has died down and people are seriously getting vaccinated airlines are set to have a comeback.

&#x200B;

Any airline will do fine but I believe that Canadian airlines will have the greatest comeback due to the very low amount of vaccinated citizens right now. As their vaccine rate goes up so will the stock prices of industries that will open up again.

The Canadian population is \~4% fully vaccinated while \~45% of them have had one dose.

[https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a7](https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a7)

&#x200B;

Compared to \~40% fully vaccinated and \~50% with at least one dose in the US

[https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations)

&#x200B;

In a previous post I showed that Air Canada was the best Canadian airline to invest with. They are slowly step laddering up in price. In mid April they received a 5.9 billion dollar bailout from the government which secured their comeback. They are just waiting for restrictions to be lifted and I'm sure they've thought of ways to profit in a post-pandemic world.

&#x200B;

Whether you invest in airlines by paying for a fun experience, or by buying their stock, either way many people are going to give their money to airlines this summer. The question is which side will you be on?

Goodluck ladies and gents

&#x200B;

**TL;DR Airlines will make a comeback as restrictions lift. Canada still has a low vax population so the good news for them will cause greater surges in airline stock prices. I know many people who want to travel but few who want to buy stock.**",nlmxyt,How to profit from the final stages of Coronavirus

8480,,2021-05-26 17:48:02,t3_nlmzdx,,wallstreetbets,"Hello fellow WSB degens,

I will be outlining for you today why RIOT and MARA even after today's run up will continue on a meteoric rise.

Firstly the price is currently in the mid 20's for each stonk. This makes sense because back in Jan 2021 the prices of both stonks were in the mid 20's because a certain underlying asset these stonks are based on was trading at 40k and is currently trading once again at 40k. I will refer to this asset during this post as CUA for the rest of this post (certain underlying asset) disclaimer for mods this whole post does not really involve CUA going up or down it is based off of several factors that lead me to believe these specific stonks are undervalued at their current prices even if CUA goes down further. I am forced to mention CUA to explain this reasoning.

Now the fact these stonks are both in the mid $20's like they were back in Jan 2021 no longer makes sense when you factor in that RIOT has tripled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment and MARA has doubled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment. This is akin to a gold mine discovering there just so happened to be double or triple the amount of gold they previously thought was in their mine, or Amazon AWS buying 2-3 times more servers to rent out if AWS could somehow guarantee clients for all those servers 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year. More mining equipment = more revenue. You can tell this is starting to get realized because even though CUA is down today (26-5-21) both of these stonks are up double digits.

As if the above was not reason enough to think these stonks could reasonably 2x or 3x even without an increase in the price of CUA please continue reading.

Now on to China banning CUA mining in China. China controls 65% of the total hash rate of CUA. If China were to stop mining CUA this would bring down the total hash rate of CUA significantly. This would be very good for any and all remaining CUA miners as the CUA difficulty would also drop by 65%. 

To help you autists understand I will compare this to pizza. (Sorry I couldnt think of how to make this analogy with tendies)

If you have 1 pizza and 10 people and you wish to split the pizza equally you would slice the pizza into 10 slices and give everyone 1 slice. This is how CUA mining works. Now imagine that China currently takes 6.5 pieces of pizza but Chinese government is going to tell Chinese citizens they can no longer legally eat pizza in China. Now the rest of the world gets to split those 6.5 pieces of pizza amongst themselves equally. 

Personally I am too retarded to actually do the math to see how this would change MARA and RIOT revenue but it might be as simple as increasing all of their profit by 65%? Not sure. Maybe you divide 65 by 35 and then add that number (1.8) to all the other miners.

The above was all concrete reasoning on why these stonks are both undervalued, but theres a literally shitton of undervalued stonks and there are plenty of retarded overpriced stonks too who is to say that any of the above reasoning matters and the people will care? Theres a lot of stonks bottom line. What is my catalyst for believing these stonks will continue to see momentum and provide tendies?

The below is my retarded opinion and autist forecast into what will occur and provide said tendies to anyone who wishes to participate in the upside of these stocks.

The large majority if not all of this past correction in CUA price can be chalked up to China and Elon. Elon recently tweeted that he no longer liked CUA due to the process of mining being ""dirty"" this is because China controls 65% of the entire hash rate of CUA and China uses the most coal for energy of any country in the world. Elon has now tweeted that he will be meeting with miners in North America to discuss this fact and allow the miners to refute. What Elon will discover is that it is highly unprofitable to mine CUA on electricity deriving from non renewable energy sources as renewable energy sources are the cheapest. The vast majority of large mining operations in North America utilize hydropower RIOT and MARA both use hydropower too. The next thing that Elon will discover is that while China uses more coal for energy than any other country they also use more hydro for energy than any other country. China leads the world in hydroelectricity by any and all metrics including number of dams, sizes of dams, total output of individual dams, total output of all dams, etc. Mining on coal energy is stupid because it is the most expensive energy to produce of any energy. Seeing as how CUA miners only have to pay for internet and electricity bills and internet doesnt really matter cheap electricity makes or breaks their business. Literally RIOT and MARA have 8 employees and 3 employees according to Robinhood. The only bill/cost they care about is electric cost and they want that to be as cheap as possible which will always be renewable energy sources.

Personally I am of the belief that this is all part of Great Daddy Elon's master plan. He pretended to side with the environmentally friendly activists who advocate against CUA mining. This brought global attention to the issue and now he will unveil that he was wrong and this is not the case because mining is all green renewable energy. Great Daddy Elon is never wrong remember that. Elon has even stated things to the contrary of his recent tweet against CUA before when he talked about oil and coal energy subsidies in the US. Just remember that the gooberment says they want more green energy yet they heavily subsidize oil, gas, and coal energy. Until 2023 if you start an oil, gas, or coal energy project the government will subsidize for you to do so to the tune of financing 80-100 percent of the project. Yes that is right. That green stuff is a lie because the peak subsidy for solar projects was 33% and its now like 26%. Great Daddy Elon knows this because Great Daddy Elon knows all as he is the one who told us this.

8481,,2021-05-26 18:08:33,t3_nlnghi,,wallstreetbets,"TLDR: The entire ecosystem surrounding Energy Fuels is primed to make it a cornerstone US REE/Uranium company. Currently sitting under a 1B market cap - it is a ticking time 'bomb'.

The below will give short thesis in each market factor surrounding Energy Fuels.

**Uranium Squeeze** \- Unless you've been sitting under a rock over the past year you know that uranium mining around the world has all but dried up due to the low spot price (its not economically viable at the current price to mine uranium). Meaning that the **world wide consumption of uranium is far outpacing the production**. Currently, the low price is sustained by reserves but once these dry up the spot price is likely to rocket up. Energy Fuels is not only sitting on reserves but can start mining within 6 months. The spot price has gone from $28 -> $31 this past month and its anyone's guess when reserves will dry up but it seems to be an inevitability. This reddit post goes more in depth for the 2021 outlook on uranium supply - [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kpjvhs/2021_will_be_an_unforgettable_year_for_uranium/)

**REE** \- Likely the largest and most important development for this company is that Energy Fuels has a road map for a complete USA in-house REE production chain. If you don't know, the REE market is exploding right now due to many new demands in the market/short supply (pls research, not going to cover here). As a case study see MP - which has a **5B market cap compared to < 1B Energy Fuels**. Now MP has to ship their material oversees for processing in China which to the US is slowly being recognized as a serious national security issue. But in walks Energy Fuels which is proposing an end to end supply chain of REE material at its facility in White Mesa, Utah baby. Lets recap, Energy Fuels **is offering not only green energy solutions with uranium but a solution to a national security risk in the REE market.** good shit.

**Monazite vs Bastnaesite and radioactive material** \- Now that you had an intro to MP, lets get to an important detail that will allow Energy Fuels to take on the REE market quickly and effectively with an inherent advantage. MP produces REE material through the mining of Bastnaesite. However, Monazite ore (which is mined by Energy Fuels for uranium) is richer in rare earths. Ok but why then would MP not simply mine Monzanite???? Its because its radioactive and in the US, there are ungodly amounts of red tape/restrictions around the stuff which basically **makes it impossible to get a new permit to handle it.** But guess who already has one due to its uranium mining - god damn Energy Fuels which means they have already have their source material in line and ready to go with an advantage in REE richness - they just have to figure out processing which brings me to the next point. Not to mention the same material can be leverage for more uranium!

See the chart below to compare the two ores (the REE market us said to only really depend on 4 critical elements - Nd neodymium, Eu europium, Tb terbium, Dy dysprosium) [source](https://www.mining.com/the-only-five-rare-earth-elements-that-matter/)

https://preview.redd.it/s6s8qwy39i171.png?width=1412&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7d910feb79393f4fe0de5fad54e89f5bead4c39

**Financials** \- Feel free to check this dd yourself but Energy Fuels is **debt free** with **$40 million in liquid cash** that they have already said is going towards developing the REE pipeline. They have the source material, they are already mining it, and now they are building the US based processing for it :)

**History** **(\*this is more speculative)** \- Energy Fuels (as the uranium market is cyclical) has gone through huge up and down swings as seen below in 2007 and 2011. We are seeing the start of the run up. Hard to say if REE will provide stability to the chart but no reason to not jump on this coming spike

8497,,2021-05-26 19:34:02,t3_nlpfk9,,wallstreetbets,"I must start this with do not touch your AMC for anything let alone a stock that hasnt even cemented itself in this new world - but the memeconemy is having a revival and with Wall St's apparent dislike of this company through shorts I think UWMC may have a nice place in this new order.

EDIT: short TLDR by u/turnerdhr23 

"" The shorts doubled up in May, from 11 million shares in April to 18.5 million shares in May. Up over 50% from April short numbers. They are trying everything they can, but you can’t fight buybacks, dividend on 6/9, inclusion in MSCI and Russell, and technicals switching to bullish. They are paying insane 70%+ interest on borrowed shares too. It’s a perfect storm. Got my popcorn ready. ""

Price action has been very nice the last few days with shorts climbing as price does steadily aswell. Approximately 20%+ of the float is being shorted according to TD. Also with this run up you bet your ass they are all in the red. Like I said in my last post, the company is currently buying back shares as of last week - so the float is likely smaller reported making the short % even higher.

With ex dividend coming up on 6/9 (match made in heaven) these shorts are sweating bricks because they know they need to cover or they will have to pay out that dividend for each share shorted on a losing position. As you are seeing towards the end of today they were trying to dump the price - likely done with even more shorts probably with the idea once they dump it enough they can cover this shit position and run. Chart below shows how its almost impossible for any short to be in the green.

[Also Schwab is telling me this is hard to borrow \(high short float\)](https://preview.redd.it/rbvjtk2zmi171.png?width=944&format=png&auto=webp&s=310642d4e17a29527ee49cc3ec4ec3780840d0c0)

DO NOT SELL HERE - the pump hasn't even started to begin Wall ST shits on the company because it was a SPAC so they shorted the fuck out of it and have been having a cash fiesta since the merger crashing the price down to laughable numbers.

THE ADVANTAGE WE HAVE IS OUR AWARENESS OF OUR RETARDATION THESE AUTISTIC HEDGE FUNDS THINK THEY ARE SMART AND CAN CONTROL PA TO ALWAYS WIN. THEY SOMEHOW THINK THAT WE ARE TO PREOCCUPIED WITH AMC AND GME BUT THEY DONT REALISE NO FUND IS SAFE.

Execute contracts if possible - I dont think there are enough shares out there to cover all these positions

TLDR: UWMC over shorted and they will have no choice to cover or pay out the dividend by 6/9 unless they can crash the price by shorting more.... Sounds familiar

Positions: shit load of shares, 8/20 $6 calls that will be executed before ex dividend. 8/20 $7 calls, the cheap play that i just loaded on are the 6/18 $9 calls. DO AS YOU WISH SHARES WILL WIN NO MATTER WHAT BUT PROVIDE LESS TENDIES",nlpfk9,UWMC Margin Warfare 2: Cover or pay me

Black berry’s forward revenue will be dominated by two things. Cylance, their cyber security software, and IVY and QNX, their vehicle data hub. Let’s start with IVY and QNX

QNX is a software for vehicles to compartmentalize all their software and data. It’s essentially an operating system for smart cars. It is currently in 175 million vehicles, with more being added every day. Any company without proprietary software (almost all of them besides Tesla) rely on QNX to run their cars’ software 

IVY is a software that reads and organizes vehicle sensor data being picked up by QNX. This is a software in the process of being rolled out, that will create the early stages of a third party self driving solution for any car company without a proprietary self driving software (almost all of them besides Tesla.) With neural networks, which are what are used to make cars self drive, data is king, and you need a lot of it. It will not be an easy thing for car companies to build themselves. And when it comes time to compete with Tesla’s self driving cars, they’ll all be clamoring for IVY

Cylance - Blackberry Cylance is an AI driven anti virus software. It’s confusing, but the gist is that there are many variations of the same virus, most being one time use and have never been seen before, and AI anti virus is needed to detect and stop all the variations. Cylance has been able to stop the attack used by dark side, the hack that brought down the colonial pipeline, since 2015

Deep Fucking Value - black berry is currently trading with a market cap of 4.8 billion dollars. It’s cash on hand is $739 million. Bringing the market cap to $4 billion. It also has 38,000 patents, some of which are in the process of being sold to Facebook for potentially 1-2 billion dollars. On the low end of these patent sales, this puts the market cap at $3 billion.

That’s $3 billion dollars for a key cog in the self driving pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) a key cog in the smart car pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) and a key player in the cyber security industry (a $250 billion dollar industry)

TLDR --Premise-- ViaSat, Inc (VSAT) is a mediocre company that provides mediocre satellite service that costs way too much for what it is.... but in many places it is the ONLY option... well it was until Mr. 🚀 himself decided to eat their lunch. StarLink (part of SpaceX) is about to absolutely destroy VSAT and turn it to 💩.

TLDR --Strategy-- since you can't invest in SpaceX (private company) or Starlink (until it is spun off into a separate entity **and then DO invest there** ) I think someone that decides to buy PUTS on VSAT (give yourself A LOT of time, I'm talking June 2022 $35 or Jan 2023 $25) stands to make a lot of money ------ I'm personally not starting my position until right before the next earnings report in August. I figure the first sign of trouble will come out in an earnings report and if it isn't August then by November it'll start showing. Again **LONG** duration puts. Looking to catch that cycle when the company drops 50% on the bad news. If it goes up between now and then I'll just buy MORE puts. 

**NOT A PROFESSIONAL FINANCIAL PERSON - INVEST AT YOUR OWN RISK - I THINK THIS MAKES SENSE BUT I MAY BE 🤪🤪🤪🤪 PERSON WHO EATS 💩 FOR ALL YOU KNOW**

details

**ViaSat - How it started**

Market cap of 3.26 Billion, share price of $47.55 when I'm writing this. It got as high as the 90's before the pandemic book the shins out of the market and dropped it to $28. Since recovered a bit to... as I said $47.55

They have some satellites in space that allow people with a receiver dish to get internet from space like some kind of awesome scifi movie.... except the internet is crazy expensive for what you get. Their satellites are pretty high up and that means each one can cover a BIG area. They only seem to have a handful, maybe a dozen? But they offer pretty broad coverage and are expanding it. BUT because the satellites are high up the latency (time between your computer and your internet source or something like that) is high leading to slow speeds and overall not a great service.

They already have airlines as customers, expanding recently with Delta. Their is VERY LITTLE competition in this business and between airlines, cruise lines and rural home owners with no other option they make a nice amount of money. Totally solid business model. Internet is ever more and more important and usage on air planes and boats is only gonna go up. In fact like a lot of articles on VSAT I would probably say this is a good medium / long term buy and that is why the median price target is $67 ***EXCEPT*** I know something that the market doesn't seem to have realized yet.

>EDITED BASED ON COMMENTS

>However, while a viable company may exist beyond the coming reckoning I expect the market to react extremely negatively to ViaSat losing **ALL** of their rural residential and rural small and medium size business customers. I'm also thinking that right around the time that starts sinking in news stories about cruise lines and air lines switching over to StarLink will start popping up and again, $VSAT go **💩.** I honestly hope VSAT does go up to the current target of the mid $60's because I'll start buying puts a small chunk at a time as it rises. Until then I'm waiting till August, right before next quarterly earnings report to start my position.

**StarLink - How it's going**

as you may the Dogefather happens to have a small 🚀 company. Its called SpaceX and they aren't publicly traded. They also are doing to the aerospace / orbit supply and transport industry what many of us wish Tesla could fully due to the fossil fuel industry. SpaceX's Falcon9 🚀 is all sorts of amazing - mainly because it isn't thrown out after each use ($40MM in savings for each subsequent use of a booster).

StarLink is a division of SpaceX that is focused on bringing internet to the whole 🌎 using a crazy amount of satellites. Like... A LOT. Unlike ViaSat which has a few the StarLink constellation (thats what they call a network of satellites) has 16 HUNDRED and they are launching 60 at a time every week or so (sometimes more than once a week). Because StarLink has access to this game changing super cheap 🚀 transportation AND Musk is doing is usual weirdness by mass producing these satellites and focusing on cost and volume instead of making them SUPER DUPER reliable

Some of you may remember how TSLA was this tiny company that was prob gonna die etc. etc. and THEN 💥💥 there are Model 3's and Model Y's EVERYWHERE. Well StarLink is gonna have that moment soon. Sometime in the next few months there will suddenly be high-ish speed internet (between 50mbs and 100mbs) literally ANYWHERE on the planet for $500 down and $100 a month. Way better product and on an annualized basis way better value.",nlsu85,First real post on WSB - found a walking zombie 🧟 and wanted to share... I bring you a tale of.... $VSAT

Performance can only be measured through the entire cycle.    The entire Cycle exposes you from all angles. 

The human brain tends to become infected with greed at the end of a big Stage 2 run (see digital  virtuals  for current example) thus causing people to lose money after a bull market because they expect it to go on forever.

  Understanding Stage Analysis can help you overcome this

&#x200B;

3-  Silver is in a position of strength. US Dollar is in a position of weakness.

8526,,2021-05-26 23:30:49,t3_nlugr7,,wallstreetbets,"CNBC’s Jim Cramer said Wednesday he’s not sure why any investors are still betting against GameStop and AMC Entertainment, two of the so-called meme stocks popular on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum.
.
.
The “Mad Money” host made his comments following a session in which GameStop shares rose almost 16% Wednesday and AMC advanced 19%. The stocks are up 37% and more than 60%, respectively, this week alone as the speculative trading that took first Wall Street by storm in January resumed.
.
.
“Anyone shorting AMC or GameStop is out of their mind. ... WallStreetBets is too powerful and trying to bet against them right now is just giving them more ammo,” Cramer said.
.
.
Despite some optimism around a potential turnaround spearheaded by Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen, Cramer contended the video-game retailer GameStop remains way overvalued. AMC — which still faces headwinds from the rise of digital streaming — is also expensive at current levels, Cramer said.
.
.
But Cramer the companies are not trading based on fundamentals, which makes shorting their stocks dangerous as long as they remain beloved by Reddit traders.
.
.
Shorting a stock is essentially a bet that it will fall in price. An investor such as a hedge fund borrows shares and then immediately sells them into the market, with the goal of buying them back later at a lower level. Then, the investor returns the borrowed shares, profiting off the price differential.
.
.
When the opposite happens and the stock rises in value, a short-seller may seek to minimize losses by purchasing shares at their higher price.
.
.
Both GameStop and AMC have over 20% of their float shares sold short, according to data from S3 Partners. That’s compared with an average of 5% short interest in a typical U.S. stock.
.
“I’ve never seen anything like this: a group of buyers with no sensitivity to price,” Cramer said. “These people don’t have unlimited firepower, but they’ve got enough firepower to engineer a short-squeeze any time a bunch of professionals decide to bet against this thing.”
.
.
“These people don’t have unlimited firepower…”

I don’t want to share with you something that you all heard so many times (yep, I haven't lost my fate in humanity) like avoid margin trading or invest in mutual funds. I believe I have some wisdom I wish I had from the beginning.

1. Trading is just 5% theory and 95% about emotional control, risk and money management, overcoming one’s greed, having strict stoploss and targets predefined before taking a trade.
2. Don’t follow advice from forums blindly. Build your own map of the world. Each of us learn to trade at our own pace and don’t get discouraged if you find that after a few years, you’re still struggling to master the ‘money game’. You can keep in mind different advice from experienced players (e.g. I recommend this qooore app and it's discord community), *but it's vital for the final decision to be yours*.
3. Accept losses and do not make investment decisions based on emotion Especially greed, fear, or panic. Yep, you didn’t buy Betcoin (lol couldn't resist) at 3,000$ because you didn’t know back than what direction the price would take. No regrets. Keep yourself focused on here and now, move ahead
4. Know yourself. What is your current financial situation? Why you are investing? For what purpose the investment is being made? This will automatically answers questions such as how long you are investing for. The other important aspect is how much risk you would normally want to take. Keeping both in mind, assess your risk carefully.
5. Never forget that for investing, time is your best friend - and greed is your worst enemy. Patience is a requirement in stock trading. There are no short-cuts or ‘holy grail’ when it comes to stock. And you only need to have couple of strategies but those should be well tested and made perfect over the period of time.

To me, trading is a skill that requires 3Ls - ‘Life-Long Learning”.

Stay humble, be honest and willing to admit your mistakes in trading and don’t try to rationalise and explain mistakes away, and always remain teachable and never think you’ve ‘arrived’.",nlvay0,After 3 years of learning investment: my 5 tips for those who just started

8535,,2021-05-27 01:00:08,t3_nlw3ty,,wallstreetbets,"Hi Everyone! I did some research on cinema stocks a while back and made a video on it. I didn't post the content here so I thought I would share it as I know everyone is interested in AMC at the moment! I know it's a lot to read so if you prefer to watch the video, the link for that is also included below:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRNn2bOC1xo&t=6s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRNn2bOC1xo&t=6s)

Why Cinema Stocks like AMC will benefit from reopening? 

Time-Frame: Cinema’s will benefit from reopening and the economic recovery that is occurring all over the world. Especially over a longer timeframe.  I think that Cinemas can be a good trade in the medium term and can help you make money. It’s all dependent on data and how quickly things go back to normal, but my timeframe on this trade right now is 1-2 years. Maybe even shorter, perhaps 6 months if we bounce back very quickly. Maybe not the most likely, but still a possible scenario that I have to consider. 

&#x200B;

Thesis: 

1)  The Covid-19 pandemic has had a very strong negative impact on the cinema sector. So, naturally as things reopen and vaccinations increase all over North America, these companies stand to benefit. If we look back from the end of January 2020 to the end of April 2021, Marcus Corporation was down approximately 33% from January 27th, 2020. Cinemark is down approximately 35% over the same time period, while National CineMedia is down almost 42% and AMC is up almost 57%. Price is an important factor to consider when buying and selling stocks and this something that is important to consider 

2) Cinemas have suffered tremendously with the Covid-19 pandemic, which makes the cinema sector intriguing as the world re-opens. If we look to Asia, especially China and Japan, where Covid-19 cases subsided and theatres reopened, things look promising.  There was a substantial increase in demand, with demand actually higher than pre-pandemic levels. In China, December 2020 ticket sales at IMAX’s big-screen theatres jumped 28 per cent from a year earlier, while in Japan, they broke daily records and a record number of people saw movies on the first weekend of January 2021. Clearly, there was a lot of pent-up demand which surfaced and benefitted movie theatres in Asia. 

3) And you know what I’ve seen this film before. Last year early in February, there was a sudden spike in downloads of the Zoom app in China, and the stock at that was point already doing well, up roughly 30 percent from the start of the year. But this spike in Zoom usage soon spread all over the world, and the rest is history. It was an absolutely humungous winner last year. There are obviously sector wide risks with consumer preferences changing, and more and more people preferring to watch films at home. The increase in Netflix & streaming service subscribers over the years is a clear indication of consumer preferences going-forward, but I do like movie theatres as a trade. There is a lot of pent-up demand that I feel will benefit the sector. 

Risks: 

\-  One of the main risks that that most people who are considering trading or investing in cinema companies have, is the risk from Netflix and the other streaming services. Really the risk of the Direct-to-consumer approach and the effects that it will have on the cinema companies. And this is a valid concern because it has reduced demand for cinemas over the last decade. Even some of the biggest filmmakers in the world are turning to it, like Martin Scorsese, Noah Baumbach and Alfonso Cuaron.  Netflix has become the biggest movie studio in the world, at-least when it comes to volume in terms of production over the last several years. And now they plan to release 50-60 films per year, and with their pioneering Direct to Consumer approach, the film industry has changed. Cinemas are no longer at the forefront, and the Direct-to-Consumer strategy is quickly becoming the new incumbent. The DTC approach is taking over, with all the streaming services that have launched. They have taken market share from linear television and have steered consumers away from traditional Cinema.

Catalysts & Conclusion: 

1) However, I still think there is still a place for theatres, even with streaming, especially looking at the same timeframe that I’m focusing on for this trade. I think now more so than ever people want to be outside. These businesses will benefit from the change in near term consumer trends, with everyone wanting to leave the house. I really believe that the cinema sector is going to do well in North America. If Asia is anything to go by and I think it is, some of the companies involved in the sector have the potential to be great trades. People still want to go to the cinemas, especially when it comes to seeing some of the big budget films that are really made for the big screen. Blockbuster action films with awesome effects are really meant to be seen in a movie theatre in my opinion. The effects and the environment simply cannot be replicated at home. Especially when it comes to immersive experience films, like those with IMAX and 4DX. I really enjoy the cinema and think there is something to be said for being in a big space in a dark room watching a film 40 feet across. It is wonderful to sit in the comfort of your own home but there is just something to be said for having a community experience in a room. But that’s neither there nor here. 

  
2) Moving on, another potential catalyst is the potential for collaboration between theatre chains and streaming services. Netflix was the one to pioneer the Direct to Consumer, but interestingly they have begun releasing some Netflix Originals on the big screen in recent years. Films like The Irishman, Marriage Story and The Two Popes all premiered in Cinemas prior to their appearance in Netflix’s online catalogue.  This is a really interesting move on their part, especially from an investment perspective. Because, while you can watch streaming services in the comfort of your own home, movie theatre companies are open to the idea of having the films that are produced by the streaming services shown in their theatres. Cinemark has shown Netflix movies in theatres in the past, and there is an off chance that they expand their agreement. This wouldn’t just apply to Cinemark but other theatre chains as well potentially. The big hold-up between the streaming services and theatre chains was the disagreement on the length of theatrical window. But last year, Universal Studios and Cinemark, AMC & Cineplex agreed to a shortened exclusive window, from 74 days to 31 days for major films, as defined by box-office domestic revenue. This makes it more likely that Netflix and other streaming services can find middle ground with the cinema companies. It’s not all that important a catalyst for the trade, nor is it all that likely, but it is still intriguing and something to consider.

3) A more important catalyst is the release of the next James Bond film, no time to die next year. I’m really excited about the movie because I’m a huge James Bond fan. It’s probably my favourite movie series. And you know what, I’m not alone. It’s very popular all over the world. The previous James Bond film, Spectre, grossed nearly $879 million. No Time To Die has been postponed several times due to the pandemic and is due to premiere on October 8th in the United States. I’m really excited about the movie and will be sure to see in theatres provided it’s safe to do so. And I think it will be. This movie is really important for the movie theatres because they have been starved and there have just been very few films to show. They have been supply constrained with the lack of new films. No Time To Die is a certain blockbuster and will really help benefit the sector. 

4) Something else that has me really excited is the recent CDC news in the US, with them updating guidance on April 2nd that fully vaccinated people can travel internationally safely and don’t need to quarantine when they return provided, they test negative within three to five days of their return. They have to test negative before they are allowed to board a return flight to the US. This is really exciting, and this combined with the idea of a vaccine passport as has been proposed by cruise lines and the UK government really provide a lot of momentum for the cinema companies.

8536,,2021-05-27 01:24:58,t3_nlwjwy,,wallstreetbets,"I will try to keep this short and sweet.
In my view the following points are justifiable:
-The VW emissions hack was not an effort to destroy the environment. 
-It was trolling done by VW officials bc they were tired of having the EPA’s pozzed dick in their asses regarding diesel emission regulations on diesel imports. 
-VW was tired of the EPA because:

     A.  In europe diesel autos make up over half of    
           all car engines. 
     B.  Cars like the Euro-version VW golf wagon      
           get almost 90 mpg. Compare that to the 
           Toyota Prius that gets 40mpg at best. 
     C.  The EPA doesnt want VW to import a 90    
           MPG diesel car to the US because it would    
           kill US auto sales, so the EPA makes diesel 
           regulations so strict that the only diesels 
           VW et. al. can import only manage 45 MPG. 
     D.  And if you want to make things fair, the 
           highest MPG diesel electric hybrid made by 
           VW gets over 200 MPG. 
     E.  Europeans aren’t idiots: they aren’t willingly 
          “poisoning themselves” with diesel fumes. 
          Diesel is just as clean as gas and burning 
          1 gallon of diesel fuel every 90 miles is 
          better for the environment than burning 1 
          gallon of gas every 30 miles. 
     F.  The “smelly/black fume producing” 
          reputation of diesel in america owes itself to 
          idiot US auto makers that in the 80’s tried to 
          make frankenstein diesel engines out of 
          modified gas engines and they ran like shit 
          and spewed black smoke. These atrocities    
          were unlike the clean running diesel engines 
          that were being produced in Germany at the 
          same time. 
-In summary, the EPA has been punishing European Auto makers (VW) for American auto makers’ past engineering disgraces, and when VW officials got tired of being unfairly punished they decided to troll the EPA with an emissions hack. 
-They did it to slam some jimmies, not to gain      
profit or destroy the environment. 
-German authorities know this, which is why they released key players like Oliver Schmidt who was let out on parole right after he was transferred from US prison to German authorities. 
-The loss of stock value that occured from the scandal was unjustified then, and the stagnation of VW stock price since then has been unjustified in light of the fact that VW’s P/E in the last 3 months has been between 50-70 times lower than that of Tesla, and historically it has been foolish to underestimate the ability of Volkswagen to perform at the cutting edge of the industry. 
-The Emissions hack has nothing negative to say about Volkswagens fierce engineering capability and in my view it has something positive to say about the youthfulness and creativity of the company.

Retail shorts have hopped on the bandwagon and when stocks move they tend to over shoot the upside and the downside. 

Sundial has over $1 billion in cash, no debt, positive operating profit, and many valuable passive investments. 

The manipulation that the stock received was absolutely insane. Institutional ownership was less than 2% when SNDL made it’s run in Feb and the big boys didn’t want to miss the party and they paid motley fool to write bash articles while they accumulate their position. This is just my assumption, which is never a good thing when valuing stocks, but as a former stock analyst I would bet that institutional ownership will be over 5% very soon and then 10%.

1. Commercial Passenger Flights:

They expect to fly 25 commercial flights in 2022, with six passengers each, which means 150 passengers for 2022.

Ticket cost is around $250k, which translates into revenues of approximately $37.5 million from Commercial Passengers in 2022

2. Additional Revenue:

Besides commercial passengers, the company has also generated some revenue by carrying payloads into space in recent years. Assuming that this will grow to about $12 million by 2022, total revenues would stand at $50 million for the year.

3) Revenue Per Share

Revenue Per Share is likely to grow to about $0.21 in 2022, assuming total shares outstanding of 234 million.

4. Value Per Share

With a sales multiple of about 70 (contains a certain amount of goodwill), it translates into a stock price of about  $15 per Share.

The current share price is $27 per Share. Assuming the assumptions are correct, this explains the current short ratio of 25%.",nm0tqe,"Is Virgin Galactic stock expensive, fair, or cheap priced?"

BUT, get your fact right.

The company has current assets, less current liabilities of about 900M in Canadian Dollars, which is about $738M USD.

They had at 2/11/2021 1,561,352,718 shares outstanding so at a share price of $0.8815 the market cap is $1.376B USD.

So you are paying a $640M premium over book value for this company. If the company can make money that might be fine. If not then the stock is valued $640M too much or about 45% too much).",,

This is a real game-changing technology which can offer a real alternative with an interchangeable battery technology for the existing lithium-ion batteries in almost every application with GMG’s Graphene and UQ’s patent-pending aluminum ion battery technology. The current nominal voltage of our batteries is 1.7 volts, and work is being carried out to increase the voltage to directly replace existing batteries and which lead to higher energy densities.

The real differentiator about these batteries is their very high power density of up to 7000 watts/kg, which endows them with a very high charge rate. Furthermore, graphene aluminum-ion batteries provide major benefits in terms of longer battery life (over 2000 charge / discharge cycles testing so far with no deterioration in performance), battery safety (very low fire potential) and lower environmental impact (more recyclable).

**What I'm doing**: Averaging in slowly in preparation for the 10D EMA to come in in preparation for another leg higher.

Market

* **The RPA Market is growing rapidly**: GVR estimates the global robotic process automation market to grow at 34% CAGR through 2028 while Gartner estimates it to grow at over 24% YoY CAGR - to $600B, through 2022 ([source](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-04-28-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-hyperautomation-enabling-software-market-to-reach-nearly-600-billion-by-2022)) and expects $PATH to grow at 33% CAGR ([source](https://www.uipath.com/resources/automation-analyst-reports/gartner-magic-quadrant-robotic-process-automation))
* **$PATH dominates the most important regions for RPA**: North America (accounts for 37% of global RPA spend ([source](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/robotic-process-automation-rpa-market)) and as of January 31, 2021, $PATH had 7,968 customers, including 80% of the Fortune 10 and 63% of the Fortune Global 500 ([source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521125014/d98556d424b4.htm#rom98556_9))

Company & Financials

* **$PATH can expect high levels of current customer retention**: UiPath has an NPS (Net Promoter Score) of 71 over the past 12 mo period, lightyears beyond the industry average of 39 ([Source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521125014/d98556d424b4.htm#rom98556_4), [Source](https://www.retently.com/blog/good-net-promoter-score/))
* **Strong revenue growth:** $PATH is experiencing YoY Revenue growth of over 80%
* **Strong profitability growth:** While $PATH grows revenues at over 80% YoY, their cost of revenue only grows at \~13% YoY. EBITDA Margin is growing at 88% YoY - $PATH will begin capturing large profits in the next year ([source](https://app.koyfin.com/fa/fa.is/eq-08u9m6))

Sup, WSB folks!

It’s Roman here with my Technical ANALysis, remember me? I’m the guy who [put the beard on the line, stating that GME is heading at least to thousands](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/), soon, and my beard is doing well so far, as you may see. Furthermore, recently I did [AMC TA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfaizr/amc_looking_juicy_next_resistance_targets_1623/), and it got to [CBS fucking news](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/)! Btw, the first major resistance there of $16 has been broken already, $20 is the next one and the things are going according to the forecast.

Congrats to AMC hodlers, but today we’ll take a look at the superior stonk‘s current TA state, discussing how things might play out in the shorter term perspective.

The first thing to take a look at this [GME](https://imgur.com/a/eAxaHhE) chart, is the beautiful Bollinger Bands setup. Bollinger Bands is a powerful TA instrument, used by traders for the purpose of identifying potential support and resistance zones, as well as a trend direction. Furthermore, BB is a helpful tool to work with the volatility, as price action‘s fluctuations are taken as a cornerstone measurement for the Bollinger channels. As you should be able to see on the chart, with the volatility in Jan, Feb and Mar the BB channel looks thick (just as your BF’s GF’s ass). Since the beginning of April, though, the consolidation is obvious, and the channel consequently has been narrowing down. But BOOM, the breakout happened yesterday followed by the conformational solidly looking gap today. The setup of a very similar nature crystallized in January too (highlighted blue) and it is easy to see what happened afterwards. Juicy, what else can I say.

MACD. The thing points up, indicating the bullish momentum, with all of the threes indicators (MACD, Signal and Histogram) being on the bullish territory and accelerating with the current price action.

And the most important factor to 🐻 in mind, resistances. As I mentioned in the title, the Purple Haze ($233) is being tested currently, and to my understanding, this is the most important price level for GME currently (refer to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/) for the explanation). As soon as this one is conquered, $350 and $481 seem to be the next two major resistances on the horizon.

I hope, that you enjoyed this little piece of TA, have a great day! 

(and compulsory not a fin advise and fuck you!)",nlmlev,"Daym it feels good to be a GME hodler in times like these! Take a look at this sweet TA picture: Bollinger Bands are boilin', MACD(onalds) pointing north... And the Purple Haze is being tested! How do you like this, Wen Moon?"

Coronavirus is almost history folks. As the world is slowly opening, and restrictions being lifted (thank you to those who are vaccinated), There's still one last industry that is preparing for take off.

This summer airlines will make a comeback. Sooner rather than later travel will be back on the menu.

The CDC is lifting all restrictions for domestic travel for vaccinated people. It's only a matter of time before more restrictions are lifted.

"" If you [travel in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html), you do not need to get tested before or after travel or self-quarantine after travel.""

[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html)

&#x200B;

Europe is considering opening it's borders to vaccinated people possibly this summer although no date is set.

[https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/)

&#x200B;

Now that the hype of the vaccine has died down and people are seriously getting vaccinated airlines are set to have a comeback.

&#x200B;

Any airline will do fine but I believe that Canadian airlines will have the greatest comeback due to the very low amount of vaccinated citizens right now. As their vaccine rate goes up so will the stock prices of industries that will open up again.

The Canadian population is \~4% fully vaccinated while \~45% of them have had one dose.

[https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a7](https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a7)

&#x200B;

Compared to \~40% fully vaccinated and \~50% with at least one dose in the US

[https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations)

&#x200B;

In a previous post I showed that Air Canada was the best Canadian airline to invest with. They are slowly step laddering up in price. In mid April they received a 5.9 billion dollar bailout from the government which secured their comeback. They are just waiting for restrictions to be lifted and I'm sure they've thought of ways to profit in a post-pandemic world.

&#x200B;

Whether you invest in airlines by paying for a fun experience, or by buying their stock, either way many people are going to give their money to airlines this summer. The question is which side will you be on?

Goodluck ladies and gents

&#x200B;

**TL;DR Airlines will make a comeback as restrictions lift. Canada still has a low vax population so the good news for them will cause greater surges in airline stock prices.

I will be outlining for you today why RIOT and MARA even after today's run up will continue on a meteoric rise.

Firstly the price is currently in the mid 20's for each stonk. This makes sense because back in Jan 2021 the prices of both stonks were in the mid 20's because a certain underlying asset these stonks are based on was trading at 40k and is currently trading once again at 40k. I will refer to this asset during this post as CUA for the rest of this post (certain underlying asset) disclaimer for mods this whole post does not really involve CUA going up or down it is based off of several factors that lead me to believe these specific stonks are undervalued at their current prices even if CUA goes down further. I am forced to mention CUA to explain this reasoning.

Now the fact these stonks are both in the mid $20's like they were back in Jan 2021 no longer makes sense when you factor in that RIOT has tripled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment and MARA has doubled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment. This is akin to a gold mine discovering there just so happened to be double or triple the amount of gold they previously thought was in their mine, or Amazon AWS buying 2-3 times more servers to rent out if AWS could somehow guarantee clients for all those servers 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year. More mining equipment = more revenue. You can tell this is starting to get realized because even though CUA is down today (26-5-21) both of these stonks are up double digits.

As if the above was not reason enough to think these stonks could reasonably 2x or 3x even without an increase in the price of CUA please continue reading.

Now on to China banning CUA mining in China. China controls 65% of the total hash rate of CUA. If China were to stop mining CUA this would bring down the total hash rate of CUA significantly. This would be very good for any and all remaining CUA miners as the CUA difficulty would also drop by 65%. 

To help you autists understand I will compare this to pizza. (Sorry I couldnt think of how to make this analogy with tendies)

If you have 1 pizza and 10 people and you wish to split the pizza equally you would slice the pizza into 10 slices and give everyone 1 slice. This is how CUA mining works. Now imagine that China currently takes 6.5 pieces of pizza but Chinese government is going to tell Chinese citizens they can no longer legally eat pizza in China. Now the rest of the world gets to split those 6.5 pieces of pizza amongst themselves equally. 

Personally I am too retarded to actually do the math to see how this would change MARA and RIOT revenue but it might be as simple as increasing all of their profit by 65%? Not sure. Maybe you divide 65 by 35 and then add that number (1.8) to all the other miners.

The above was all concrete reasoning on why these stonks are both undervalued, but theres a literally shitton of undervalued stonks and there are plenty of retarded overpriced stonks too who is to say that any of the above reasoning matters and the people will care? Theres a lot of stonks bottom line. What is my catalyst for believing these stonks will continue to see momentum and provide tendies?

The below is my retarded opinion and autist forecast into what will occur and provide said tendies to anyone who wishes to participate in the upside of these stocks.

The large majority if not all of this past correction in CUA price can be chalked up to China and Elon. Elon recently tweeted that he no longer liked CUA due to the process of mining being ""dirty"" this is because China controls 65% of the entire hash rate of CUA and China uses the most coal for energy of any country in the world. Elon has now tweeted that he will be meeting with miners in North America to discuss this fact and allow the miners to refute. What Elon will discover is that it is highly unprofitable to mine CUA on electricity deriving from non renewable energy sources as renewable energy sources are the cheapest. The vast majority of large mining operations in North America utilize hydropower RIOT and MARA both use hydropower too. The next thing that Elon will discover is that while China uses more coal for energy than any other country they also use more hydro for energy than any other country. China leads the world in hydroelectricity by any and all metrics including number of dams, sizes of dams, total output of individual dams, total output of all dams, etc. Mining on coal energy is stupid because it is the most expensive energy to produce of any energy. Seeing as how CUA miners only have to pay for internet and electricity bills and internet doesnt really matter cheap electricity makes or breaks their business. Literally RIOT and MARA have 8 employees and 3 employees according to Robinhood. The only bill/cost they care about is electric cost and they want that to be as cheap as possible which will always be renewable energy sources.

Personally I am of the belief that this is all part of Great Daddy Elon's master plan. He pretended to side with the environmentally friendly activists who advocate against CUA mining. This brought global attention to the issue and now he will unveil that he was wrong and this is not the case because mining is all green renewable energy. Great Daddy Elon is never wrong remember that. Elon has even stated things to the contrary of his recent tweet against CUA before when he talked about oil and coal energy subsidies in the US. Just remember that the gooberment says they want more green energy yet they heavily subsidize oil, gas, and coal energy. Until 2023 if you start an oil, gas, or coal energy project the government will subsidize for you to do so to the tune of financing 80-100 percent of the project. Yes that is right. That green stuff is a lie because the peak subsidy for solar projects was 33% and its now like 26%. Great Daddy Elon knows this because Great Daddy Elon knows all as he is the one who told us this.

8682,,2021-05-26 18:08:33,t3_nlnghi,,wallstreetbets,"TLDR: The entire ecosystem surrounding Energy Fuels is primed to make it a cornerstone US REE/Uranium company. Currently sitting under a 1B market cap - it is a ticking time 'bomb'.

The below will give short thesis in each market factor surrounding Energy Fuels.

**Uranium Squeeze** \- Unless you've been sitting under a rock over the past year you know that uranium mining around the world has all but dried up due to the low spot price (its not economically viable at the current price to mine uranium). Meaning that the **world wide consumption of uranium is far outpacing the production**. Currently, the low price is sustained by reserves but once these dry up the spot price is likely to rocket up. Energy Fuels is not only sitting on reserves but can start mining within 6 months. The spot price has gone from $28 -> $31 this past month and its anyone's guess when reserves will dry up but it seems to be an inevitability. This reddit post goes more in depth for the 2021 outlook on uranium supply - [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kpjvhs/2021_will_be_an_unforgettable_year_for_uranium/)

**REE** \- Likely the largest and most important development for this company is that Energy Fuels has a road map for a complete USA in-house REE production chain. If you don't know, the REE market is exploding right now due to many new demands in the market/short supply (pls research, not going to cover here). As a case study see MP - which has a **5B market cap compared to < 1B Energy Fuels**. Now MP has to ship their material oversees for processing in China which to the US is slowly being recognized as a serious national security issue. But in walks Energy Fuels which is proposing an end to end supply chain of REE material at its facility in White Mesa, Utah baby. Lets recap, Energy Fuels **is offering not only green energy solutions with uranium but a solution to a national security risk in the REE market.** good shit.

**Monazite vs Bastnaesite and radioactive material** \- Now that you had an intro to MP, lets get to an important detail that will allow Energy Fuels to take on the REE market quickly and effectively with an inherent advantage. MP produces REE material through the mining of Bastnaesite. However, Monazite ore (which is mined by Energy Fuels for uranium) is richer in rare earths. Ok but why then would MP not simply mine Monzanite???? Its because its radioactive and in the US, there are ungodly amounts of red tape/restrictions around the stuff which basically **makes it impossible to get a new permit to handle it.** But guess who already has one due to its uranium mining - god damn Energy Fuels which means they have already have their source material in line and ready to go with an advantage in REE richness - they just have to figure out processing which brings me to the next point. Not to mention the same material can be leverage for more uranium!

See the chart below to compare the two ores (the REE market us said to only really depend on 4 critical elements - Nd neodymium, Eu europium, Tb terbium, Dy dysprosium) [source](https://www.mining.com/the-only-five-rare-earth-elements-that-matter/)

https://preview.redd.it/s6s8qwy39i171.png?width=1412&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7d910feb79393f4fe0de5fad54e89f5bead4c39

**Financials** \- Feel free to check this dd yourself but Energy Fuels is **debt free** with **$40 million in liquid cash** that they have already said is going towards developing the REE pipeline. They have the source material, they are already mining it, and now they are building the US based processing for it :)

**History** **(\*this is more speculative)** \- Energy Fuels (as the uranium market is cyclical) has gone through huge up and down swings as seen below in 2007 and 2011. We are seeing the start of the run up. Hard to say if REE will provide stability to the chart but no reason to not jump on this coming spike

EDIT: short TLDR by u/turnerdhr23 

"" The shorts doubled up in May, from 11 million shares in April to 18.5 million shares in May. Up over 50% from April short numbers. They are trying everything they can, but you can’t fight buybacks, dividend on 6/9, inclusion in MSCI and Russell, and technicals switching to bullish. They are paying insane 70%+ interest on borrowed shares too. It’s a perfect storm. Got my popcorn ready. ""

Price action has been very nice the last few days with shorts climbing as price does steadily aswell. Approximately 20%+ of the float is being shorted according to TD. Also with this run up you bet your ass they are all in the red. Like I said in my last post, the company is currently buying back shares as of last week - so the float is likely smaller reported making the short % even higher.

With ex dividend coming up on 6/9 (match made in heaven) these shorts are sweating bricks because they know they need to cover or they will have to pay out that dividend for each share shorted on a losing position. As you are seeing towards the end of today they were trying to dump the price - likely done with even more shorts probably with the idea once they dump it enough they can cover this shit position and run. Chart below shows how its almost impossible for any short to be in the green.

[Also Schwab is telling me this is hard to borrow \(high short float\)](https://preview.redd.it/rbvjtk2zmi171.png?width=944&format=png&auto=webp&s=310642d4e17a29527ee49cc3ec4ec3780840d0c0)

DO NOT SELL HERE - the pump hasn't even started to begin Wall ST shits on the company because it was a SPAC so they shorted the fuck out of it and have been having a cash fiesta since the merger crashing the price down to laughable numbers.

THE ADVANTAGE WE HAVE IS OUR AWARENESS OF OUR RETARDATION THESE AUTISTIC HEDGE FUNDS THINK THEY ARE SMART AND CAN CONTROL PA TO ALWAYS WIN. THEY SOMEHOW THINK THAT WE ARE TO PREOCCUPIED WITH AMC AND GME BUT THEY DONT REALISE NO FUND IS SAFE.

Execute contracts if possible - I dont think there are enough shares out there to cover all these positions

TLDR: UWMC over shorted and they will have no choice to cover or pay out the dividend by 6/9 unless they can crash the price by shorting more.... Sounds familiar

Positions: shit load of shares, 8/20 $6 calls that will be executed before ex dividend. 8/20 $7 calls, the cheap play that i just loaded on are the 6/18 $9 calls. DO AS YOU WISH SHARES WILL WIN NO MATTER WHAT BUT PROVIDE LESS TENDIES",nlpfk9,UWMC Margin Warfare 2: Cover or pay me

Black berry’s forward revenue will be dominated by two things. Cylance, their cyber security software, and IVY and QNX, their vehicle data hub. Let’s start with IVY and QNX

QNX is a software for vehicles to compartmentalize all their software and data. It’s essentially an operating system for smart cars. It is currently in 175 million vehicles, with more being added every day. Any company without proprietary software (almost all of them besides Tesla) rely on QNX to run their cars’ software 

IVY is a software that reads and organizes vehicle sensor data being picked up by QNX. This is a software in the process of being rolled out, that will create the early stages of a third party self driving solution for any car company without a proprietary self driving software (almost all of them besides Tesla.) With neural networks, which are what are used to make cars self drive, data is king, and you need a lot of it. It will not be an easy thing for car companies to build themselves. And when it comes time to compete with Tesla’s self driving cars, they’ll all be clamoring for IVY

Cylance - Blackberry Cylance is an AI driven anti virus software. It’s confusing, but the gist is that there are many variations of the same virus, most being one time use and have never been seen before, and AI anti virus is needed to detect and stop all the variations. Cylance has been able to stop the attack used by dark side, the hack that brought down the colonial pipeline, since 2015

Deep Fucking Value - black berry is currently trading with a market cap of 4.8 billion dollars. It’s cash on hand is $739 million. Bringing the market cap to $4 billion. It also has 38,000 patents, some of which are in the process of being sold to Facebook for potentially 1-2 billion dollars. On the low end of these patent sales, this puts the market cap at $3 billion.

That’s $3 billion dollars for a key cog in the self driving pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) a key cog in the smart car pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) and a key player in the cyber security industry (a $250 billion dollar industry)

TLDR --Premise-- ViaSat, Inc (VSAT) is a mediocre company that provides mediocre satellite service that costs way too much for what it is.... but in many places it is the ONLY option... well it was until Mr. 🚀 himself decided to eat their lunch. StarLink (part of SpaceX) is about to absolutely destroy VSAT and turn it to 💩.

TLDR --Strategy-- since you can't invest in SpaceX (private company) or Starlink (until it is spun off into a separate entity **and then DO invest there** ) I think someone that decides to buy PUTS on VSAT (give yourself A LOT of time, I'm talking June 2022 $35 or Jan 2023 $25) stands to make a lot of money ------ I'm personally not starting my position until right before the next earnings report in August. I figure the first sign of trouble will come out in an earnings report and if it isn't August then by November it'll start showing. Again **LONG** duration puts. Looking to catch that cycle when the company drops 50% on the bad news. If it goes up between now and then I'll just buy MORE puts. 

**NOT A PROFESSIONAL FINANCIAL PERSON - INVEST AT YOUR OWN RISK - I THINK THIS MAKES SENSE BUT I MAY BE 🤪🤪🤪🤪 PERSON WHO EATS 💩 FOR ALL YOU KNOW**

details

**ViaSat - How it started**

Market cap of 3.26 Billion, share price of $47.55 when I'm writing this. It got as high as the 90's before the pandemic book the shins out of the market and dropped it to $28. Since recovered a bit to... as I said $47.55

They have some satellites in space that allow people with a receiver dish to get internet from space like some kind of awesome scifi movie.... except the internet is crazy expensive for what you get. Their satellites are pretty high up and that means each one can cover a BIG area. They only seem to have a handful, maybe a dozen? But they offer pretty broad coverage and are expanding it. BUT because the satellites are high up the latency (time between your computer and your internet source or something like that) is high leading to slow speeds and overall not a great service.

They already have airlines as customers, expanding recently with Delta. Their is VERY LITTLE competition in this business and between airlines, cruise lines and rural home owners with no other option they make a nice amount of money. Totally solid business model. Internet is ever more and more important and usage on air planes and boats is only gonna go up. In fact like a lot of articles on VSAT I would probably say this is a good medium / long term buy and that is why the median price target is $67 ***EXCEPT*** I know something that the market doesn't seem to have realized yet.

I'm also thinking that right around the time that starts sinking in news stories about cruise lines and air lines switching over to StarLink will start popping up and again, $VSAT go **💩.** I honestly hope VSAT does go up to the current target of the mid $60's because I'll start buying puts a small chunk at a time as it rises. Until then I'm waiting till August, right before next quarterly earnings report to start my position.

**StarLink - How it's going**

as you may the Dogefather happens to have a small 🚀 company. Its called SpaceX and they aren't publicly traded. They also are doing to the aerospace / orbit supply and transport industry what many of us wish Tesla could fully due to the fossil fuel industry. SpaceX's Falcon9 🚀 is all sorts of amazing - mainly because it isn't thrown out after each use ($40MM in savings for each subsequent use of a booster).

StarLink is a division of SpaceX that is focused on bringing internet to the whole 🌎 using a crazy amount of satellites. Like... A LOT. Unlike ViaSat which has a few the StarLink constellation (thats what they call a network of satellites) has 16 HUNDRED and they are launching 60 at a time every week or so (sometimes more than once a week). Because StarLink has access to this game changing super cheap 🚀 transportation AND Musk is doing is usual weirdness by mass producing these satellites and focusing on cost and volume instead of making them SUPER DUPER reliable

Some of you may remember how TSLA was this tiny company that was prob gonna die etc. etc. and THEN 💥💥 there are Model 3's and Model Y's EVERYWHERE. Well StarLink is gonna have that moment soon. Sometime in the next few months there will suddenly be high-ish speed internet (between 50mbs and 100mbs) literally ANYWHERE on the planet for $500 down and $100 a month. Way better product and on an annualized basis way better value.",nlsu85,First real post on WSB - found a walking zombie 🧟 and wanted to share... I bring you a tale of.... $VSAT

Performance can only be measured through the entire cycle.    The entire Cycle exposes you from all angles. 

The human brain tends to become infected with greed at the end of a big Stage 2 run (see digital  virtuals  for current example) thus causing people to lose money after a bull market because they expect it to go on forever.

  Understanding Stage Analysis can help you overcome this

So now let's  dig in our today's post and my targets  : 

1-  Silver will enjoy huge capital flows from those digital assets  holders in a time after overcame and understand stage analysis .... who will now seek the silver whale! 

&#x200B;

2- We are in stage 2 for silver  !!! We can expect parabolic moves any time .  

 Opportunity of buying silver cheap and timely is about to end. 

 Silver has never failed to reach it's ALL-TIME highs after gold does it first.  ( gold did it 2020 July ) 

So, it's not a questions of IF... but WHEN?  

Tic Toc !

&#x200B;

3-  Silver is in a position of strength. US Dollar is in a position of weakness. 

 The final 15% decline in the US Dollar index WILL send silver parabolic!

4-  The ""silver"" macro tidal wave is picking up steam &will crush all price suppression along the way...  Q2 close will set the stage how fast the insanity picks up.  HOLD ON TIGHT! Easy 56$ and 120$ targets

8727,,2021-05-26 23:30:49,t3_nlugr7,,wallstreetbets,"CNBC’s Jim Cramer said Wednesday he’s not sure why any investors are still betting against GameStop and AMC Entertainment, two of the so-called meme stocks popular on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum.
.
.
The “Mad Money” host made his comments following a session in which GameStop shares rose almost 16% Wednesday and AMC advanced 19%. The stocks are up 37% and more than 60%, respectively, this week alone as the speculative trading that took first Wall Street by storm in January resumed.
.
.
“Anyone shorting AMC or GameStop is out of their mind. ... WallStreetBets is too powerful and trying to bet against them right now is just giving them more ammo,” Cramer said.
.
.
Despite some optimism around a potential turnaround spearheaded by Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen, Cramer contended the video-game retailer GameStop remains way overvalued. AMC — which still faces headwinds from the rise of digital streaming — is also expensive at current levels, Cramer said.
.
.
But Cramer the companies are not trading based on fundamentals, which makes shorting their stocks dangerous as long as they remain beloved by Reddit traders.
.
.
Shorting a stock is essentially a bet that it will fall in price. An investor such as a hedge fund borrows shares and then immediately sells them into the market, with the goal of buying them back later at a lower level. Then, the investor returns the borrowed shares, profiting off the price differential.
.
.
When the opposite happens and the stock rises in value, a short-seller may seek to minimize losses by purchasing shares at their higher price.
.
.
Both GameStop and AMC have over 20% of their float shares sold short, according to data from S3 Partners. That’s compared with an average of 5% short interest in a typical U.S. stock.
.
“I’ve never seen anything like this: a group of buyers with no sensitivity to price,” Cramer said. “These people don’t have unlimited firepower, but they’ve got enough firepower to engineer a short-squeeze any time a bunch of professionals decide to bet against this thing.”
.
.
“These people don’t have unlimited firepower…”

I don’t want to share with you something that you all heard so many times (yep, I haven't lost my fate in humanity) like avoid margin trading or invest in mutual funds. I believe I have some wisdom I wish I had from the beginning.

1. Trading is just 5% theory and 95% about emotional control, risk and money management, overcoming one’s greed, having strict stoploss and targets predefined before taking a trade.
2. Don’t follow advice from forums blindly. Build your own map of the world. Each of us learn to trade at our own pace and don’t get discouraged if you find that after a few years, you’re still struggling to master the ‘money game’. You can keep in mind different advice from experienced players (e.g. I recommend this qooore app and it's discord community), *but it's vital for the final decision to be yours*.
3. Accept losses and do not make investment decisions based on emotion Especially greed, fear, or panic. Yep, you didn’t buy Betcoin (lol couldn't resist) at 3,000$ because you didn’t know back than what direction the price would take. No regrets. Keep yourself focused on here and now, move ahead
4. Know yourself. What is your current financial situation? Why you are investing? For what purpose the investment is being made? This will automatically answers questions such as how long you are investing for. The other important aspect is how much risk you would normally want to take. Keeping both in mind, assess your risk carefully.
5. Never forget that for investing, time is your best friend - and greed is your worst enemy. Patience is a requirement in stock trading. There are no short-cuts or ‘holy grail’ when it comes to stock. And you only need to have couple of strategies but those should be well tested and made perfect over the period of time.

To me, trading is a skill that requires 3Ls - ‘Life-Long Learning”.

Stay humble, be honest and willing to admit your mistakes in trading and don’t try to rationalise and explain mistakes away, and always remain teachable and never think you’ve ‘arrived’.",nlvay0,After 3 years of learning investment: my 5 tips for those who just started

8736,,2021-05-27 01:00:08,t3_nlw3ty,,wallstreetbets,"Hi Everyone! I did some research on cinema stocks a while back and made a video on it. I didn't post the content here so I thought I would share it as I know everyone is interested in AMC at the moment! I know it's a lot to read so if you prefer to watch the video, the link for that is also included below:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRNn2bOC1xo&t=6s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRNn2bOC1xo&t=6s)

Why Cinema Stocks like AMC will benefit from reopening? 

Time-Frame: Cinema’s will benefit from reopening and the economic recovery that is occurring all over the world. Especially over a longer timeframe.  I think that Cinemas can be a good trade in the medium term and can help you make money. It’s all dependent on data and how quickly things go back to normal, but my timeframe on this trade right now is 1-2 years. Maybe even shorter, perhaps 6 months if we bounce back very quickly. Maybe not the most likely, but still a possible scenario that I have to consider. 

&#x200B;

Thesis: 

1)  The Covid-19 pandemic has had a very strong negative impact on the cinema sector. So, naturally as things reopen and vaccinations increase all over North America, these companies stand to benefit. If we look back from the end of January 2020 to the end of April 2021, Marcus Corporation was down approximately 33% from January 27th, 2020. Cinemark is down approximately 35% over the same time period, while National CineMedia is down almost 42% and AMC is up almost 57%. Price is an important factor to consider when buying and selling stocks and this something that is important to consider 

2) Cinemas have suffered tremendously with the Covid-19 pandemic, which makes the cinema sector intriguing as the world re-opens. If we look to Asia, especially China and Japan, where Covid-19 cases subsided and theatres reopened, things look promising.  There was a substantial increase in demand, with demand actually higher than pre-pandemic levels. In China, December 2020 ticket sales at IMAX’s big-screen theatres jumped 28 per cent from a year earlier, while in Japan, they broke daily records and a record number of people saw movies on the first weekend of January 2021. Clearly, there was a lot of pent-up demand which surfaced and benefitted movie theatres in Asia. 

3) And you know what I’ve seen this film before. Last year early in February, there was a sudden spike in downloads of the Zoom app in China, and the stock at that was point already doing well, up roughly 30 percent from the start of the year. But this spike in Zoom usage soon spread all over the world, and the rest is history. It was an absolutely humungous winner last year. There are obviously sector wide risks with consumer preferences changing, and more and more people preferring to watch films at home. The increase in Netflix & streaming service subscribers over the years is a clear indication of consumer preferences going-forward, but I do like movie theatres as a trade. There is a lot of pent-up demand that I feel will benefit the sector. 

Risks: 

\-  One of the main risks that that most people who are considering trading or investing in cinema companies have, is the risk from Netflix and the other streaming services. Really the risk of the Direct-to-consumer approach and the effects that it will have on the cinema companies. And this is a valid concern because it has reduced demand for cinemas over the last decade. Even some of the biggest filmmakers in the world are turning to it, like Martin Scorsese, Noah Baumbach and Alfonso Cuaron.  Netflix has become the biggest movie studio in the world, at-least when it comes to volume in terms of production over the last several years. And now they plan to release 50-60 films per year, and with their pioneering Direct to Consumer approach, the film industry has changed. Cinemas are no longer at the forefront, and the Direct-to-Consumer strategy is quickly becoming the new incumbent. The DTC approach is taking over, with all the streaming services that have launched. They have taken market share from linear television and have steered consumers away from traditional Cinema.

Catalysts & Conclusion: 

1) However, I still think there is still a place for theatres, even with streaming, especially looking at the same timeframe that I’m focusing on for this trade. I think now more so than ever people want to be outside. These businesses will benefit from the change in near term consumer trends, with everyone wanting to leave the house. I really believe that the cinema sector is going to do well in North America. If Asia is anything to go by and I think it is, some of the companies involved in the sector have the potential to be great trades. People still want to go to the cinemas, especially when it comes to seeing some of the big budget films that are really made for the big screen. Blockbuster action films with awesome effects are really meant to be seen in a movie theatre in my opinion. The effects and the environment simply cannot be replicated at home. Especially when it comes to immersive experience films, like those with IMAX and 4DX. I really enjoy the cinema and think there is something to be said for being in a big space in a dark room watching a film 40 feet across. It is wonderful to sit in the comfort of your own home but there is just something to be said for having a community experience in a room. But that’s neither there nor here. 

  
2) Moving on, another potential catalyst is the potential for collaboration between theatre chains and streaming services. Netflix was the one to pioneer the Direct to Consumer, but interestingly they have begun releasing some Netflix Originals on the big screen in recent years. Films like The Irishman, Marriage Story and The Two Popes all premiered in Cinemas prior to their appearance in Netflix’s online catalogue.  This is a really interesting move on their part, especially from an investment perspective. Because, while you can watch streaming services in the comfort of your own home, movie theatre companies are open to the idea of having the films that are produced by the streaming services shown in their theatres. Cinemark has shown Netflix movies in theatres in the past, and there is an off chance that they expand their agreement. This wouldn’t just apply to Cinemark but other theatre chains as well potentially. The big hold-up between the streaming services and theatre chains was the disagreement on the length of theatrical window. But last year, Universal Studios and Cinemark, AMC & Cineplex agreed to a shortened exclusive window, from 74 days to 31 days for major films, as defined by box-office domestic revenue. This makes it more likely that Netflix and other streaming services can find middle ground with the cinema companies. It’s not all that important a catalyst for the trade, nor is it all that likely, but it is still intriguing and something to consider.

3) A more important catalyst is the release of the next James Bond film, no time to die next year. I’m really excited about the movie because I’m a huge James Bond fan. It’s probably my favourite movie series. And you know what, I’m not alone. It’s very popular all over the world. The previous James Bond film, Spectre, grossed nearly $879 million. No Time To Die has been postponed several times due to the pandemic and is due to premiere on October 8th in the United States. I’m really excited about the movie and will be sure to see in theatres provided it’s safe to do so. And I think it will be. This movie is really important for the movie theatres because they have been starved and there have just been very few films to show. They have been supply constrained with the lack of new films. No Time To Die is a certain blockbuster and will really help benefit the sector. 

4) Something else that has me really excited is the recent CDC news in the US, with them updating guidance on April 2nd that fully vaccinated people can travel internationally safely and don’t need to quarantine when they return provided, they test negative within three to five days of their return. They have to test negative before they are allowed to board a return flight to the US. This is really exciting, and this combined with the idea of a vaccine passport as has been proposed by cruise lines and the UK government really provide a lot of momentum for the cinema companies.

8737,,2021-05-27 01:24:58,t3_nlwjwy,,wallstreetbets,"I will try to keep this short and sweet.
In my view the following points are justifiable:
-The VW emissions hack was not an effort to destroy the environment. 
-It was trolling done by VW officials bc they were tired of having the EPA’s pozzed dick in their asses regarding diesel emission regulations on diesel imports. 
-VW was tired of the EPA because:

     A.  In europe diesel autos make up over half of    
           all car engines. 
     B.  Cars like the Euro-version VW golf wagon      
           get almost 90 mpg. Compare that to the 
           Toyota Prius that gets 40mpg at best. 
     C.  The EPA doesnt want VW to import a 90    
           MPG diesel car to the US because it would    
           kill US auto sales, so the EPA makes diesel 
           regulations so strict that the only diesels 
           VW et. al. can import only manage 45 MPG. 
     D.  And if you want to make things fair, the 
           highest MPG diesel electric hybrid made by 
           VW gets over 200 MPG. 
     E.  Europeans aren’t idiots: they aren’t willingly 
          “poisoning themselves” with diesel fumes. 
          Diesel is just as clean as gas and burning 
          1 gallon of diesel fuel every 90 miles is 
          better for the environment than burning 1 
          gallon of gas every 30 miles. 
     F.  The “smelly/black fume producing” 
          reputation of diesel in america owes itself to 
          idiot US auto makers that in the 80’s tried to 
          make frankenstein diesel engines out of 
          modified gas engines and they ran like shit 
          and spewed black smoke. These atrocities    
          were unlike the clean running diesel engines 
          that were being produced in Germany at the 
          same time. 
-In summary, the EPA has been punishing European Auto makers (VW) for American auto makers’ past engineering disgraces, and when VW officials got tired of being unfairly punished they decided to troll the EPA with an emissions hack. 
-They did it to slam some jimmies, not to gain      
profit or destroy the environment. 
-German authorities know this, which is why they released key players like Oliver Schmidt who was let out on parole right after he was transferred from US prison to German authorities. 
-The loss of stock value that occured from the scandal was unjustified then, and the stagnation of VW stock price since then has been unjustified in light of the fact that VW’s P/E in the last 3 months has been between 50-70 times lower than that of Tesla, and historically it has been foolish to underestimate the ability of Volkswagen to perform at the cutting edge of the industry. 
-The Emissions hack has nothing negative to say about Volkswagens fierce engineering capability and in my view it has something positive to say about the youthfulness and creativity of the company.

Retail shorts have hopped on the bandwagon and when stocks move they tend to over shoot the upside and the downside. 

Sundial has over $1 billion in cash, no debt, positive operating profit, and many valuable passive investments. 

The manipulation that the stock received was absolutely insane. Institutional ownership was less than 2% when SNDL made it’s run in Feb and the big boys didn’t want to miss the party and they paid motley fool to write bash articles while they accumulate their position. This is just my assumption, which is never a good thing when valuing stocks, but as a former stock analyst I would bet that institutional ownership will be over 5% very soon and then 10%.

1. Commercial Passenger Flights:

They expect to fly 25 commercial flights in 2022, with six passengers each, which means 150 passengers for 2022.

Ticket cost is around $250k, which translates into revenues of approximately $37.5 million from Commercial Passengers in 2022

2. Additional Revenue:

Besides commercial passengers, the company has also generated some revenue by carrying payloads into space in recent years. Assuming that this will grow to about $12 million by 2022, total revenues would stand at $50 million for the year.

3) Revenue Per Share

Revenue Per Share is likely to grow to about $0.21 in 2022, assuming total shares outstanding of 234 million.

4. Value Per Share

With a sales multiple of about 70 (contains a certain amount of goodwill), it translates into a stock price of about  $15 per Share.

BUT, get your fact right.

The company has current assets, less current liabilities of about 900M in Canadian Dollars, which is about $738M USD.

They had at 2/11/2021 1,561,352,718 shares outstanding so at a share price of $0.8815 the market cap is $1.376B USD.

So you are paying a $640M premium over book value for this company. If the company can make money that might be fine. If not then the stock is valued $640M too much or about 45% too much).",,

It was as silly and hilariously awful as Jonah hills mask in Django! I brought her a bunch of actual masks the next day but it killed me that her superiors were spreading bs like that. I hope it was just her boss and not the company (it’s a big company)

If you got the same money back today, then your $1 investment would only return $1 in total return because there is no opportunity cost or risk. The market won't compensate you for not doing anything because 100 other people would be willing to take the same deal.

In the case of Virgin Galactic, if one of the ships works, I'm willing to bet they can just copy the same blueprints and make a bunch more. And it seems like there is a great deal of demand for the tickets. And it seems like they can keep costs low with reusable ships. Plus, there is no competition. By the time Blue Origin or SpaceX start offering tourists trips into space, many wealthy boomers will have died. My guess is that they'll want to experience weightlessness while they are still alive, and Virgin Galactic would be their only opportunity.",,

This is a real game-changing technology which can offer a real alternative with an interchangeable battery technology for the existing lithium-ion batteries in almost every application with GMG’s Graphene and UQ’s patent-pending aluminum ion battery technology. The current nominal voltage of our batteries is 1.7 volts, and work is being carried out to increase the voltage to directly replace existing batteries and which lead to higher energy densities.

The real differentiator about these batteries is their very high power density of up to 7000 watts/kg, which endows them with a very high charge rate. Furthermore, graphene aluminum-ion batteries provide major benefits in terms of longer battery life (over 2000 charge / discharge cycles testing so far with no deterioration in performance), battery safety (very low fire potential) and lower environmental impact (more recyclable).

**What I'm doing**: Averaging in slowly in preparation for the 10D EMA to come in in preparation for another leg higher.

Market

* **The RPA Market is growing rapidly**: GVR estimates the global robotic process automation market to grow at 34% CAGR through 2028 while Gartner estimates it to grow at over 24% YoY CAGR - to $600B, through 2022 ([source](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-04-28-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-hyperautomation-enabling-software-market-to-reach-nearly-600-billion-by-2022)) and expects $PATH to grow at 33% CAGR ([source](https://www.uipath.com/resources/automation-analyst-reports/gartner-magic-quadrant-robotic-process-automation))
* **$PATH dominates the most important regions for RPA**: North America (accounts for 37% of global RPA spend ([source](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/robotic-process-automation-rpa-market)) and as of January 31, 2021, $PATH had 7,968 customers, including 80% of the Fortune 10 and 63% of the Fortune Global 500 ([source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521125014/d98556d424b4.htm#rom98556_9))

Company & Financials

* **$PATH can expect high levels of current customer retention**: UiPath has an NPS (Net Promoter Score) of 71 over the past 12 mo period, lightyears beyond the industry average of 39 ([Source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521125014/d98556d424b4.htm#rom98556_4), [Source](https://www.retently.com/blog/good-net-promoter-score/))
* **Strong revenue growth:** $PATH is experiencing YoY Revenue growth of over 80%
* **Strong profitability growth:** While $PATH grows revenues at over 80% YoY, their cost of revenue only grows at \~13% YoY. EBITDA Margin is growing at 88% YoY - $PATH will begin capturing large profits in the next year ([source](https://app.koyfin.com/fa/fa.is/eq-08u9m6))

TA & Entry

* $PATH has consolidated off it's IPO highs
* $PATH has tested these highs multiple times and is forming a nice support
* Traders are waiting for 10D EMA to catch up before accepting another run

What if they are the ones driving it up getting a lot of people who hold the shares to start buying calls and shares. And they will start another attack to bring it down again. When it’s down the profit is booked.

Sup, WSB folks!

It’s Roman here with my Technical ANALysis, remember me? I’m the guy who [put the beard on the line, stating that GME is heading at least to thousands](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/), soon, and my beard is doing well so far, as you may see. Furthermore, recently I did [AMC TA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfaizr/amc_looking_juicy_next_resistance_targets_1623/), and it got to [CBS fucking news](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/)! Btw, the first major resistance there of $16 has been broken already, $20 is the next one and the things are going according to the forecast.

Congrats to AMC hodlers, but today we’ll take a look at the superior stonk‘s current TA state, discussing how things might play out in the shorter term perspective.

The first thing to take a look at this [GME](https://imgur.com/a/eAxaHhE) chart, is the beautiful Bollinger Bands setup. Bollinger Bands is a powerful TA instrument, used by traders for the purpose of identifying potential support and resistance zones, as well as a trend direction. Furthermore, BB is a helpful tool to work with the volatility, as price action‘s fluctuations are taken as a cornerstone measurement for the Bollinger channels. As you should be able to see on the chart, with the volatility in Jan, Feb and Mar the BB channel looks thick (just as your BF’s GF’s ass). Since the beginning of April, though, the consolidation is obvious, and the channel consequently has been narrowing down. But BOOM, the breakout happened yesterday followed by the conformational solidly looking gap today. The setup of a very similar nature crystallized in January too (highlighted blue) and it is easy to see what happened afterwards. Juicy, what else can I say.

MACD. The thing points up, indicating the bullish momentum, with all of the threes indicators (MACD, Signal and Histogram) being on the bullish territory and accelerating with the current price action.

And the most important factor to 🐻 in mind, resistances. As I mentioned in the title, the Purple Haze ($233) is being tested currently, and to my understanding, this is the most important price level for GME currently (refer to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/) for the explanation). As soon as this one is conquered, $350 and $481 seem to be the next two major resistances on the horizon.

I hope, that you enjoyed this little piece of TA, have a great day! 

(and compulsory not a fin advise and fuck you!)",nlmlev,"Daym it feels good to be a GME hodler in times like these! Take a look at this sweet TA picture: Bollinger Bands are boilin', MACD(onalds) pointing north... And the Purple Haze is being tested! How do you like this, Wen Moon?"

This is a real game-changing technology which can offer a real alternative with an interchangeable battery technology for the existing lithium-ion batteries in almost every application with GMG’s Graphene and UQ’s patent-pending aluminum ion battery technology. The current nominal voltage of our batteries is 1.7 volts, and work is being carried out to increase the voltage to directly replace existing batteries and which lead to higher energy densities.

The real differentiator about these batteries is their very high power density of up to 7000 watts/kg, which endows them with a very high charge rate. Furthermore, graphene aluminum-ion batteries provide major benefits in terms of longer battery life (over 2000 charge / discharge cycles testing so far with no deterioration in performance), battery safety (very low fire potential) and lower environmental impact (more recyclable).

9536,,2021-05-26 16:16:05,t3_nlktes,,wallstreetbets,"TLDR - Great market growth, awesome fundamentals, great product & retention, exciting TA set up.

**What I'm doing**: Averaging in slowly in preparation for the 10D EMA to come in in preparation for another leg higher.

Market

* **The RPA Market is growing rapidly**: GVR estimates the global robotic process automation market to grow at 34% CAGR through 2028 while Gartner estimates it to grow at over 24% YoY CAGR - to $600B, through 2022 ([source](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-04-28-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-hyperautomation-enabling-software-market-to-reach-nearly-600-billion-by-2022)) and expects $PATH to grow at 33% CAGR ([source](https://www.uipath.com/resources/automation-analyst-reports/gartner-magic-quadrant-robotic-process-automation))
* **$PATH dominates the most important regions for RPA**: North America (accounts for 37% of global RPA spend ([source](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/robotic-process-automation-rpa-market)) and as of January 31, 2021, $PATH had 7,968 customers, including 80% of the Fortune 10 and 63% of the Fortune Global 500 ([source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521125014/d98556d424b4.htm#rom98556_9))

Company & Financials

* **$PATH can expect high levels of current customer retention**: UiPath has an NPS (Net Promoter Score) of 71 over the past 12 mo period, lightyears beyond the industry average of 39 ([Source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521125014/d98556d424b4.htm#rom98556_4), [Source](https://www.retently.com/blog/good-net-promoter-score/))
* **Strong revenue growth:** $PATH is experiencing YoY Revenue growth of over 80%
* **Strong profitability growth:** While $PATH grows revenues at over 80% YoY, their cost of revenue only grows at \~13% YoY. EBITDA Margin is growing at 88% YoY - $PATH will begin capturing large profits in the next year ([source](https://app.koyfin.com/fa/fa.is/eq-08u9m6))

TA & Entry

* $PATH has consolidated off it's IPO highs
* $PATH has tested these highs multiple times and is forming a nice support
* Traders are waiting for 10D EMA to catch up before accepting another run

What if they are the ones driving it up getting a lot of people who hold the shares to start buying calls and shares. And they will start another attack to bring it down again. When it’s down the profit is booked.

Let's go back to the days where accepting government funds was embarrassing and something that was only for the most extreme emergencies. Ben Franklin was right when he said America is a wonderful form of government and will be right up to the point where it's citizens learn they can vote themselves government benefits. That is what is killing our government and insuring that your kids will grow up in a society that is closer to a Chinese dictatorship than to the free society our founders intended. So go bitch about red states and not getting ""free money"" as it's that mentality that will get you what you deserve.

She eventually let go of the Gamestop around $50 for the tax write off, but she doubled down on AMC the other day. I got her to buy 1 share of GME @ 165 a few weeks ago lol. I'm in Gamestop with 5 shares @ 187, and a little in AMC. I sold all my free shares on WeBull the other day and bought 3 shares of AMC @14 when it was trading @ 12.50.

This is a real game-changing technology which can offer a real alternative with an interchangeable battery technology for the existing lithium-ion batteries in almost every application with GMG’s Graphene and UQ’s patent-pending aluminum ion battery technology. The current nominal voltage of our batteries is 1.7 volts, and work is being carried out to increase the voltage to directly replace existing batteries and which lead to higher energy densities.

The real differentiator about these batteries is their very high power density of up to 7000 watts/kg, which endows them with a very high charge rate. Furthermore, graphene aluminum-ion batteries provide major benefits in terms of longer battery life (over 2000 charge / discharge cycles testing so far with no deterioration in performance), battery safety (very low fire potential) and lower environmental impact (more recyclable).

9818,,2021-05-26 16:16:05,t3_nlktes,,wallstreetbets,"TLDR - Great market growth, awesome fundamentals, great product & retention, exciting TA set up.

**What I'm doing**: Averaging in slowly in preparation for the 10D EMA to come in in preparation for another leg higher.

Market

* **The RPA Market is growing rapidly**: GVR estimates the global robotic process automation market to grow at 34% CAGR through 2028 while Gartner estimates it to grow at over 24% YoY CAGR - to $600B, through 2022 ([source](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-04-28-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-hyperautomation-enabling-software-market-to-reach-nearly-600-billion-by-2022)) and expects $PATH to grow at 33% CAGR ([source](https://www.uipath.com/resources/automation-analyst-reports/gartner-magic-quadrant-robotic-process-automation))
* **$PATH dominates the most important regions for RPA**: North America (accounts for 37% of global RPA spend ([source](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/robotic-process-automation-rpa-market)) and as of January 31, 2021, $PATH had 7,968 customers, including 80% of the Fortune 10 and 63% of the Fortune Global 500 ([source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521125014/d98556d424b4.htm#rom98556_9))

Company & Financials

* **$PATH can expect high levels of current customer retention**: UiPath has an NPS (Net Promoter Score) of 71 over the past 12 mo period, lightyears beyond the industry average of 39 ([Source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521125014/d98556d424b4.htm#rom98556_4), [Source](https://www.retently.com/blog/good-net-promoter-score/))
* **Strong revenue growth:** $PATH is experiencing YoY Revenue growth of over 80%
* **Strong profitability growth:** While $PATH grows revenues at over 80% YoY, their cost of revenue only grows at \~13% YoY. EBITDA Margin is growing at 88% YoY - $PATH will begin capturing large profits in the next year ([source](https://app.koyfin.com/fa/fa.is/eq-08u9m6))

TA & Entry

* $PATH has consolidated off it's IPO highs
* $PATH has tested these highs multiple times and is forming a nice support
* Traders are waiting for 10D EMA to catch up before accepting another run

But think about it, what if this is a ploy?
What if they are the ones driving it up getting a lot of people who hold the shares to start buying calls and shares. And they will start another attack to bring it down again. When it’s down the profit is booked.

The highest open interest is at 300 and I’m sure people are buying these calls. The number doubled just as I was typing this post!",nll1q4,Could it be possible that they are simulating a squeeze to get people to buy higher and then they will drop it like a potato again?
