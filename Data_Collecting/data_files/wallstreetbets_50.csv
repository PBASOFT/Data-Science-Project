Or buy up like 1,000 very particular battle rifles because a few team guys said they felt really good on the range, so hey, now they're an option for everyone. 

Second, a ""mission command platform,"" while probably pretty fancy for SOCOM, ultimately is never THAT fancy. It's software. Try googling ""CPOF."" That's what conventional units get. Now THAT'S your government budget shit."

557,gzr9idz,2021-05-28 13:34:27,t1_gzr9idz,t1_gzqd86c,wallstreetbets,"thanks! I 100% understand your thinking and honestly that is part of what I am banking on. I believe GE has turned the corner and adults are once again in charge. I don't think it is the same company it was before things got bloated and ridiculous but I do think the new GE is lean and positioned REALLY well.

Do I think that if GE was fairly valued it should triple? no not at all. However GE's valuation got SO low that even after doubling (which I was along for the ride on) I expect it to continue going up. Right now it is rising on the turnaround story part and over the next year as they continue to aggressively shed debt AND their FCF grows and they start making real profits each quarter the fundamentals will keep the stock moving higher. 

As for diversification this isn't the only thing I'm in, just only showed that part of my portfolio.

And I am a huge Tesla fanboy myself. If you were going to give me one million dollars worth of stock from either Tesla or GE I'd take the tesla stock but right now I'm looking to identify shorter term plays that I can profit on using calls to leverage my buying power. And I am very confident on the timing of this particular story. I could totally see Tesla dropping 50% over the next year only to explode later, or not. Who the heck knows? I did make a good chunk on Tesla's run up pre split."

850,gzr9uhz,2021-05-28 13:37:06,t1_gzr9uhz,t1_gzr93fh,wallstreetbets,"Viotility was connected to overall markets. We hit 330 last time we reported data, the same week GME took okk, so we went down with the market. Then the CEO was kind of quiet while they were getting manufacturing worked out and we got hit with a lot of shorts. Like GME or AMC. In the last couple weeks manufacturing has been all sorted out. The FDA has been in communication with us and basically all the t's in the eyes have been crossed and dotted.  

Whenever a biotech is pre-revenue the share price is all over the place. We are finally entering the stage of revenue. Went from being in the negative in 2019 to having two billion dollars in our balance sheet from deposits on purchase orders. So now we have orders finalized manufacturing finalized. Governments not companies but governments sending us millions and billions dollars worth of orders that are locked and loaded. 

During the last earnings call the CEO said it was just going to be another couple months until approval and everybody got their panties up in a bunch and thought approval was going to be within a couple weeks so there was a sell-off. But there's no reason for a giant sell-off when approval is coming weeks down the road people just aren't patient these days. That being said we're supposed to start getting approvals from different countries in July. 

All in all this is the moment in time where the volatility will start getting a little bit better and we should be over 250 without a problem as a support."

Today, Zach's tried to piss all over it by calling it the ""Bear of the day"", Morgan Stanley cut the price target to $18 from $24, and some chimp ive never heard of called Wedbush cut the price to $14 from $17.  Tell me this: Are these chumps any better than Citron?  We all know what happened the last time a firm was so adamant on shorting a stock, and its about to happen again with RKT.  All 3 of these chumps just laid the launch pad with their bearish attitude towards the stock, I look forward to seeing what happens after the match is lit on RKT, and its not going to be a launchpad explosion."

There's discussion that there are folks distracting from the 2 main tickers, but there is also discussion about other tickers because not everyone wants to get involved with amc or gme, DYOR and then invest. Look at charts, look at your entry vs. Other people's entry. Pay attention to what's being published and not just because a few comments or few posts mentioning it.

On Twitter, financial analytics group Ortex said new losses generated for short sellers of the meme stock were ""up to $500 million in the pre-market alone. Total losses in $AMC this week are $1.75 bilion so far. Retail investors on social media fueled the rise of AMC earlier in the year.

Short sellers will be hard pressed once it moves above $8.60, which is technical resistance for now. They are working hard to keep it down, but I believe we could well see a capitulation and a rush to cover today. When a stock is shorted by 35%++, it is expected that any move to the upside on a stock that has been trading in oversold territory for over a month will accelerate. Historically, SDC has moved up intra-day by 67% in a  rush to cover (w/out any news). Feeling good about my long position this morning."

Movie theater has surged 120% this week to a four-year high
Mentions on social media have soared with #AMCSTRONG trending
The relentless four-day winning streak in AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. is drawing even more blood from short sellers.

The movie theater‚Äôs 120% surge so far this week has dealt investors betting against it roughly $1.3 billion in losses, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners. The stock, which has become a poster child for retail traders using Twitter and Reddit to squeeze short-sellers, soared 36% Thursday to the highest level since May 2017.

AMC Entertainment shares have more than doubled so far this week
Retail investors have cheered gains in the cinema chain while hashtags like #AMCSTRONG, #AMC500k, and #OccupyWallstreetAMC trended on Twitter. The stock has consistently been the most referenced asset on the social trading platforms like StockTwits lately. Thursday‚Äôs rally cost shorts another $634 million, according to S3 Partners, bringing losses to just below $2 billion for the year.

While some shorts have been covering their positions, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3‚Äôs managing director of predictive analytics, he believes the pain could get even worse for skeptics. The company, along with retail investor favorite GameStop Corp., ranks high on S3 Partners‚Äô ‚ÄúSqueeze Score metric‚Äù with each scoring a 10 out of 10.

‚ÄúThis signifies that both stocks have a high potential for a short squeeze, dependent on their upcoming stock price moves,‚Äù Dusaniwsky said by email. Roughly 20% of shares available for trading for both companies are currently sold short, S3 Partners data show."

Even if they didn't help out the hedge funds, that is still a lot of orders to process at market open. You might have still been stuck waiting for your order to be fulfilled regardless of the fact that Robinhood/Sheriff of Nottingham is stealing from the poor and giving to the rich."

Because if people sell on friday your shares will be null and won't count towards the total shares held by retail. Thus helping to hide the amount of synthetic/fake shares hedgies have injected into amc.

And no, shorts surprisingly have not covered.  On wednesday, amc had 90 million short volume and si actually went up the past few days. Amc had went up 20% and shorters lost over $700 million that day alone. 
And yesterday amc ran up to 36%. Shorters are fuk, and they fucking dumb too"

If you *strongly* believe your meme is higher quality than all the memes currently on r/wallstreetbets/hot, then you may message the moderators.

I know this is disappointing, and you probably put some hard work into this, but this is how we keep the WSB feeds clean for everyone, including the /new feed.

You should have *some* flexibility with the funds, but generally they are all blended assets which are stable and safe, and I don't know anything, but I'd recommend target funds (they're structured based on 5 year increments for your target retirement date). 

First you should absolutely hit the annual $19.5k pre tax. And second the Roth IRA (or traditional converted depending on income) max of $6k (which you can put into your own Fidelity account and play with stocks and options if you so choose). Thirdly, invest post-tax money into your 401k. This isn't available at every job. The max per year is $57k."

Several activists have been considering Rite Aid. One was waiting for the political climate to change (Trump to leave office), before making a move. So now that Trump is out, that barrier is removed and they can move forward if they are still interested. The thing about Rite Aid - it's a wild card. You know something good is going to happen, but you don't know when or what. One caveat is it might be a takeover target with a low ball offer like Cerberus made a couple of years ago. Employees and shareholders of Rite Aid deserve better."

The prices aren't as good as they used to be but still really good.

For example, 255/260 spreads for next week run about $1.50. For something as volatile as GME you'd expect the odds of it expiring past that to be closer to 50%. Yet it's priced at about 30% chance instead."
