First, SOCOM gets what they want and they don't care about money. Of all the combatant commands, SOCOM is the biggest trust fund baby.

Or buy up like 1,000 very particular battle rifles because a few team guys said they felt really good on the range, so hey, now they're an option for everyone. 

Second, a ""mission command platform,"" while probably pretty fancy for SOCOM, ultimately is never THAT fancy. It's software. Try googling ""CPOF."" That's what conventional units get. Now THAT'S your government budget shit."

Don't believe it? What do you think would happen if amc squeeze to 2k Adam Ape splits it back down below 100 giving every hodler about 20x more shares AND he turned on dividends... you might get some selling but definitely more lifetime holders

557,gzr9idz,2021-05-28 13:34:27,t1_gzr9idz,t1_gzqd86c,wallstreetbets,"thanks! I 100% understand your thinking and honestly that is part of what I am banking on. I believe GE has turned the corner and adults are once again in charge. I don't think it is the same company it was before things got bloated and ridiculous but I do think the new GE is lean and positioned REALLY well.

Do I think that if GE was fairly valued it should triple? no not at all. However GE's valuation got SO low that even after doubling (which I was along for the ride on) I expect it to continue going up. Right now it is rising on the turnaround story part and over the next year as they continue to aggressively shed debt AND their FCF grows and they start making real profits each quarter the fundamentals will keep the stock moving higher. 

As for diversification this isn't the only thing I'm in, just only showed that part of my portfolio.

And I am a huge Tesla fanboy myself. If you were going to give me one million dollars worth of stock from either Tesla or GE I'd take the tesla stock but right now I'm looking to identify shorter term plays that I can profit on using calls to leverage my buying power. And I am very confident on the timing of this particular story. I could totally see Tesla dropping 50% over the next year only to explode later, or not. Who the heck knows? I did make a good chunk on Tesla's run up pre split."

Does this sound correct?  Yesterday after hours I submitted a request through ETrade to transfer my RH acct to them.  This morning I went into my RH acct and it showed my account is inactive.  ETrade says it'll take 10 days to xfer.  Would RH of been notified that quickly and they made it inactive or could this be related to something business related?

850,gzr9uhz,2021-05-28 13:37:06,t1_gzr9uhz,t1_gzr93fh,wallstreetbets,"Viotility was connected to overall markets. We hit 330 last time we reported data, the same week GME took okk, so we went down with the market. Then the CEO was kind of quiet while they were getting manufacturing worked out and we got hit with a lot of shorts. Like GME or AMC. In the last couple weeks manufacturing has been all sorted out. The FDA has been in communication with us and basically all the t's in the eyes have been crossed and dotted.  

Whenever a biotech is pre-revenue the share price is all over the place. We are finally entering the stage of revenue. Went from being in the negative in 2019 to having two billion dollars in our balance sheet from deposits on purchase orders. So now we have orders finalized manufacturing finalized. Governments not companies but governments sending us millions and billions dollars worth of orders that are locked and loaded. 

During the last earnings call the CEO said it was just going to be another couple months until approval and everybody got their panties up in a bunch and thought approval was going to be within a couple weeks so there was a sell-off. But there's no reason for a giant sell-off when approval is coming weeks down the road people just aren't patient these days. That being said we're supposed to start getting approvals from different countries in July. 

All in all this is the moment in time where the volatility will start getting a little bit better and we should be over 250 without a problem as a support."

Tell me this: Are these chumps any better than Citron?  We all know what happened the last time a firm was so adamant on shorting a stock, and its about to happen again with RKT.  All 3 of these chumps just laid the launch pad with their bearish attitude towards the stock, I look forward to seeing what happens after the match is lit on RKT, and its not going to be a launchpad explosion."

I know this is disappointing, and you probably put some hard work into this, but this is how we keep the WSB feeds clean for everyone, including the /new feed.

There's discussion that there are folks distracting from the 2 main tickers, but there is also discussion about other tickers because not everyone wants to get involved with amc or gme, DYOR and then invest. Look at charts, look at your entry vs. Other people's entry. Pay attention to what's being published and not just because a few comments or few posts mentioning it. 

I believe SPCE had a recent successful flight and that's why it's picking up in price, news, and here."

**Shares of movie-chain operator AMC Entertainment climbed 20% in premarket trading, after jumping 36% on Thursday, and more than doubled over the last four days. On Twitter, financial analytics group Ortex said new losses generated for short sellers of the meme stock were ""up to $500 million in the pre-market alone. Total losses in $AMC this week are $1.75 bilion so far. Retail investors on social media fueled the rise of AMC earlier in the year. Videogames retailer GameStop , also a popular meme stock this year, was up 2.7% in premarket.**![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|upvote)"

LOS ANGELES, CA, BOCA RATON, FL, and TORONTO, May 25, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Stem Holdings (OTCQX:STMH, CSE:STEM) (“Stem”) and The Tinley Beverage Company Inc. (“Tinley's” and, together with Stem, the “Companies”) are pleased to announce the integration of Stem’s technology into Tinley’s website, enabling a fast home delivery solution for cannabis-infused beverages throughout the State of California.
Led by Adam Berk, who was the founder and CEO of the first patented online food ordering company in the U.S., Osmio, which became GrubHub, Stem’s licensed, proprietary home delivery network BudeeTM reaches 92% of California’s population for delivery within two (2) hours or by a scheduled time.

This technology, now integrated into Tinley’s own web site, enables consumers to select Tinley’s beverages on www.drinktinley.com and execute an order for delivery by BudeeTM on their website in an apparent seamless customer experience."

Short sellers will be hard pressed once it moves above $8.60, which is technical resistance for now. They are working hard to keep it down, but I believe we could well see a capitulation and a rush to cover today. When a stock is shorted by 35%++, it is expected that any move to the upside on a stock that has been trading in oversold territory for over a month will accelerate. Historically, SDC has moved up intra-day by 67% in a  rush to cover (w/out any news). Feeling good about my long position this morning."

Movie theater has surged 120% this week to a four-year high
Mentions on social media have soared with #AMCSTRONG trending
The relentless four-day winning streak in AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. is drawing even more blood from short sellers.

The movie theater’s 120% surge so far this week has dealt investors betting against it roughly $1.3 billion in losses, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners. The stock, which has become a poster child for retail traders using Twitter and Reddit to squeeze short-sellers, soared 36% Thursday to the highest level since May 2017.

AMC Entertainment shares have more than doubled so far this week
Retail investors have cheered gains in the cinema chain while hashtags like #AMCSTRONG, #AMC500k, and #OccupyWallstreetAMC trended on Twitter. The stock has consistently been the most referenced asset on the social trading platforms like StockTwits lately. Thursday’s rally cost shorts another $634 million, according to S3 Partners, bringing losses to just below $2 billion for the year.

While some shorts have been covering their positions, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3’s managing director of predictive analytics, he believes the pain could get even worse for skeptics. The company, along with retail investor favorite GameStop Corp., ranks high on S3 Partners’ “Squeeze Score metric” with each scoring a 10 out of 10.

“This signifies that both stocks have a high potential for a short squeeze, dependent on their upcoming stock price moves,” Dusaniwsky said by email. Roughly 20% of shares available for trading for both companies are currently sold short, S3 Partners data show."

In the end, all of us nobodies have our orders filled at worse prices. Whereas, if you waited about 15-30 minutes after market open, you would have a more realistic price of what your market order will be fulfilled at.

Even if they didn't help out the hedge funds, that is still a lot of orders to process at market open. You might have still been stuck waiting for your order to be fulfilled regardless of the fact that Robinhood/Sheriff of Nottingham is stealing from the poor and giving to the rich."

Because if people sell on friday your shares will be null and won't count towards the total shares held by retail. Thus helping to hide the amount of synthetic/fake shares hedgies have injected into amc.

And no, shorts surprisingly have not covered.  On wednesday, amc had 90 million short volume and si actually went up the past few days. Amc had went up 20% and shorters lost over $700 million that day alone. 
And yesterday amc ran up to 36%. Shorters are fuk, and they fucking dumb too"

You should have *some* flexibility with the funds, but generally they are all blended assets which are stable and safe, and I don't know anything, but I'd recommend target funds (they're structured based on 5 year increments for your target retirement date). 

First you should absolutely hit the annual $19.5k pre tax. And second the Roth IRA (or traditional converted depending on income) max of $6k (which you can put into your own Fidelity account and play with stocks and options if you so choose). Thirdly, invest post-tax money into your 401k. This isn't available at every job. The max per year is $57k."

There is no big short position consolidated by one holder that’s going to go bankrupt. We are literally pumping the price so they won’t cover. All they have to do is continue to borrow on interest. So right now we are literally squeezing to make them lose money by paying more interest and losing money covering. There is no gamma that’s going to start a recursive explosion of buying and selling.

We all know the story: it has been shortured (tortured) in the past couple of weeks and chart says it's seen more than enough. Its loading dock level, ready for fuel Nothing but upside ahead and it's ripe af.

What would happen when everybody stops trading? No buy, no sell on this level. Just leaving them alone.

We could set our buy wall at 5 or 6 for AMC. And buy every share when they like to give it to us."

Several activists have been considering Rite Aid. One was waiting for the political climate to change (Trump to leave office), before making a move. So now that Trump is out, that barrier is removed and they can move forward if they are still interested. The thing about Rite Aid - it's a wild card. You know something good is going to happen, but you don't know when or what. One caveat is it might be a takeover target with a low ball offer like Cerberus made a couple of years ago. Employees and shareholders of Rite Aid deserve better."

It just *feels* like there is much more than 3% or 4% inflation going on this year.

So you've got people in their 401k going ""WOW I am beating inflation by a lot!"" Yeah sure you are beating the *official* inflation but when compared to actual reality your gains are more meager."

I exited UWMC with my initial investment this morning, and I'm glad I did as it dropped as soon as I hit the Sell button. Still holding BB and GME. BB I'm not sure what to do with and GME well....to the moon baby!!!!"
