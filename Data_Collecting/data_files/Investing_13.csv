25,gz8fs9z,2021-05-24 03:07:01,t1_gz8fs9z,t1_gz7sjjl,investing,"So I decided to check if Berkshire has underperformed the S+P for a decade. 

It has a beta of 0.88 which has been fairly consistent, and a return of 13.84% compared to the S+P's return of 14.3% over the last decade. Given a 10-year treasury rate that implies and alpha of 1.06, so pretty good so far. 

10-year standard deviation of S+P is 14.04%, giving it a respectable sharpe ratio of .94. 

10-year sharpe of Berkshire is 0.87

The SPY worst 3-mo performance was -19.53%, whereas the worst 3-mo performance for BRK was -19.28%. The worst 1-year performance of the last 10 for SPY was -6.99, where berkshire's worst was -16.26%. 

Given that BRK has a value tilt, and the overall performance of value over the past decade, and that he does operate with a lower beta than the market BRK has done pretty average over the last decade. We have definitely seen some style drift from BRK over the years, and its days of significant consistent outperformance are likely long in the rearview mirror.

The covariance of BRK with the S+P seems to be rising over time. My gut says that BRK is getting pushed out of mid-cap and small-cap value in part due to its size. They have too much money, and not enough places they are willing to deploy it. They have a market value likely in significant excess to their holdings, and they are getting dragged away from their original mandate and core competency",,

From what I've heard it's an old boys club (in a good way)...lots of smart Ivy League type folks working there for their whole career and they all follow the same process. ​Lots of manpower spent researching each company. They also aren't a NY firm: Baltimore based but with a few International locations. 

IMO the hardest thing to do is to concentrate on growth companies and not getting blown up during market corrections, and that's what they manage to nail down. Value investing is much easier by comparison...just buy low PE companies with low debt. T Rowe is not a value shop. 

T Rowe New Horizons is a good example of this. Mostly invests in growthy tech/health type stuff but they've beaten their index for over 20 years and yet again they've managed not to get pulverized this year so far while funds like ARK are in pain.

Japan Fund is another one, been around since 1991...perservered through Japan's big recession. 

The other thing is if a fund starts to get successful, they pretty much always close it to new investors to protect their existing clients. You can't get into any of their good funds anymore. 

Note that they aren't always a slam dunk. Their Eastern Europe and Middle East fund have done terrible IMO because you can't deliver alpha in a country when it's run by crooks.

Graham writes:

>An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.

Second, addiction is a more complex problem than merely bad decision making.  If you don't treat the underlying problem, you'll look elsewhere for that same dopamine rush.  And I know you may be using the word metaphorically but I would let a professional assess that.  Families have been destroyed by gambling addictions.

&#x200B;

>Investing is not boring, it's a thrill ride.

This is the kind of thing addicts in recovery romanticize and reminisce about, and it's this mindset that leads to relapse.

Real investing is boring.   The thing that concerns me is I sense that you're not asking me, ""How do I get boring?""  

You're really asking me, ""How do I get the rush *and* the money?""

The dopamine rush in the market, same as casinos, is not from money.  It's triggered in reaction to the fear and anxiety when you take blind risks.

You need to treat the underlying addiction, or you will keep looking for ways to feed it.",,

A long time compared to our lifetimes, for sure! 

But the whole idea of value outperforming is predicated on a paradigm shift re rates: if rates go bearish, value outperforms. Value bulls have called for value to outperform on the belief that there'd be some sort of rate-rise, which we just didn't see since the full-on fever-pitch Value evangelism of 2012-ish.

If you held growth through that entire period, you came out on top. But you could get the opposite effect extending the time horizon another decade.

Point is, the 'debate' is about the next regime shift; not the average results over multiple regimes.

Low cost natural gas supplies in the US have already made the US one of the world's largest LNG exporters with Cheniere Energy (Ticker: LNG) being the largest US one. Cheniere's founder is the founder of Tellurian (Ticker: TELL).

Charif Souki (former CEO of Cheniere) was ousted from there by activist shareholder, Carl Icahn, and started TELL.

I believe he and the team at TELL - he is Executive Chairman - will do better. Unlike Cheniere, TELL has its own natgas production source and will have its own pipeline network to supply from there to its planned liquefaction plant at Lake Charles plus that network will connect with other natgas supply sources available also, as shown below...

Pipeline network: https://ibb.co/2KCHnnj

That owned Haynesville source means their pricing will be lower than Henry Hub prices that dictate Cheniere's and most other US LNG exporters prices. This from the slide show I linked in above shows TELL's price calculation...

LNG pricing: https://ibb.co/yFNbD4B

TELL's opportunity:

Spot LNG prices in Asia are usually double to triple the price of US LNG. Since such commodities win on price TELL has an enormous price advantage as an exporter at a time when demand is likely to exceed supply for a long time.

I've seen this line of reasoning a pop up a few times now and it's intriguing. Let me ask a counter-question: 

You equate the dividend payment to selling shares. I don't love this description but I will try to work on wrapping me head around it. Even so, in reality I *haven't* sold any shares, and more to the point, with my dividend payment I will actually buy more share to increase my share count. Over the course of 20 years, I may go from an initial position of 100 shares to 350 shares by re-investing the dividends. So in sum, my gains will include:

1) Share appreciation over timeframe of 20 years (my assumption here is that most will hold steady/increase with the markets in general over such a long time frame)

2) Inflated share count compared to initial position (delta = today's position - principle position)


A second line of thought:

You mention that paying a dividend is like selling shares. Well theoretically you could only do this so many times before running out of. For example, let's say the stock is $20. It pays a dividend of $1. Now it is ""worth"" $19. Next quarter it pays out another dollar. Now it is ""worth"" $18... so on and so forth. How does the logic here hold?


Sorry that's a long reply but you got my brain thinking! :)",,

In spite of what Buffett recommends, I don't think it's a good idea.   [Ben Felix does a great job of explaining why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR7e1Y-HJxQ&ab_channel=BenFelix), but here are my thoughts:

The S&P 500 has had an incredible decade, but [there have been times when international stocks have done better](https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/files/5myths_intl_2016_chart2.jpg).   So ideally you want both, which you do.

Just comparing the total US and total international indexes....International stocks held in broadly diversified funds will usually give you more exposure to different sectors (financials, energy, industrials, materials) vs the US stocks that are heavily weighted in tech, healthcare, and consumer discretionary stocks.  The international stock index is also made up of smaller companies with lower PE's (value stocks).  These are two risk factors that historically do well for investors with long time horizons.   In short, global diversification is a good thing and that's why your SOFI accounts do it for you.",,

In my opinion......only my opinion - i think if she starts losing customers *(ark funds go down in value as people pull out cash to move to spy or qqq or whatever.) 
If she starts losing customers - it will have detrimental effects on some of her holdings because she holds so much. *(not tesla.) But the other ones with smaller market caps. 

I think she was good in 2020 when the whole market is green as the incredible hulk. 

But in 2021 she is not taking into account time value *(ie there are alot of people out there who freak out if their investments go down for 5 or 6 months straight......if those people pull out......there may be a mass exodus and her funds could be super cheap or ??.)

- Non diversifiable risk : this is the risk of the overall market.

Also in capital market theory, it is assumed that risk = volatility. This is something that most model use in finance. Everry bank use this. But IMO, this is... debatable to say the least (Warren Buffet think it's nonsense too).

324,,2021-05-24 09:14:33,t3_njtnys,,investing,"I'm a new investor looking for companies that are both growing and paying dividends. In my search, I found a company called Arbor, which is a REIT with a very juicy dividend yield (7.86%). Usually, dividend yields this high are when the company stock falls due to a bad future outlook, and it's expected that the company might have to cut its dividends soon, but that's not the case here — $ABR has been steadily growing for years. 

I tried to read a bit more about this company, but I feel like I'm lacking the knowledge to understand what's it doing to be growing so much. It's a REIT that specializes in mortgages, but I thought this kind of stuff got less popular after 2008? Is it super risky?

It's not discussed very much on the internet, most articles I saw about it seem auto-generated from templates and mostly about the stock price (like [this one](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-arbor-realty-trust-abr-is-a-great-momentum-stock-to-buy-2021-03-17)). 

Some more useful info I found:

- [comparison of mREITs](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4398102-you-are-considering-mortgage-reits-you-must-read-this) on seeking alpha which does not discuss Arbor much, but other mREIT stocks it mentions (like $STWD, $BXMT, $ACRE, and $LADR) while having similar yield, don't have similar stock price growth;

I would suggest to everyone, get good at what you do. Get an edge in real life. Get good credit score, get good mortgage deal and buy an awesome house with land, where you can grown organic food. 

Put more earn money in ETFs. It works better, than having few % higher rate of return.

It has happened to every great investor out there. You simply cannot achieve these kinds of returns without occasionally seeing large drawdowns and underperformance.

Now to answer your question. My problem with her isn’t with woods herself. It’s with the way people talk and act about her. How they act like she is the next warren buffet because she had two years of outperformance. The rest of the time she was pretty much just flat. I’m not a huge buffet fanboy who thinks nobody can compare to him, or that anything but value investing is a losing strategy, but it should be no secret that I think her strategy is trash. I saw a graph comparing her performance to an ETF of none profitable companies, and it’s the same. She literally only care about growth, if the company is growing she doesn’t care how trash it otherwise is, and I have a hard time seeing how this strategy can be as consistent as real investing.

Now I could live with her having a different strategy. If that’s what people want, that’s all fine, but she ain’t even taking herself seriously. When she put out her bear case for Tesla I lost all respect for her. It was a joke. Her bear case had a higher price target than the current price, and everyone with a brain, including herself, know that’s not the bear case for Tesla. Yet she presented it as if it was a serious bear case. The way I view her is that she was at the right place at the right time. She got lucky that her strategy happened to work in this environment. On top of that she isn’t even taking her own investors serious as she presents them with clear bullshit cases.",,

If the USD weakens, your international allocations will benefit. It gets a bit more complicated when talking about converting back to your home currency. Vanguard has done some research about currency risk’s contribution to the volatility of returns and found that it doesn’t predictably increase or decrease volatility. Over the observed period, unhedged portfolios had lower volatility than hedged portfolios in the US and UK, but higher than in Canada and Australia. So currency hedging may not meaningfully mitigate that risk. Increasing your domestic allocation would meaningfully reduce volatility associated with exchange rates, but you’re then essentially changing your entire investment strategy and betting much bigger on your home country’s market. I can’t say whether that’s a good or a bad thing, I am not familiar enough with the Philippine’s market to say. I would start by looking at the volatility of your domestic market (as denominated in PHP). If it’s much more volatile than VTI/VXUS, you might just be trading one driver of volatility for another.

I was replying to /u/GraspingInfinity's anecdote about how the market cap of a coin is calculated, and his claim that (last price x coins outstanding) = market cap is somehow different from (last price x shares outstanding) = market cap.

Also /u/GraspingInfinity said that just because $10 was spent on the last ""coin"" in the market this doesn't mean $10 was spend on every coin, which again, also applies identically to equities.  In this case my example was TSLA, despite the share price being $600/share, only a small fraction of shareholders actually purchased their shares for this price, while the long term holders may have purchased for a fraction of this figure.

393,,2021-05-24 10:20:55,t3_njunge,,investing,"ICAGY's a stock I've watched since last year during the COVID downturn. All airlines fell but rose back to their normal levels EXCEPT for ICAGY. On paper, it seems pretty solid. It's a conglomerate of British Airways and Iberian Airways (the crown jewels of British and Spanish governments), and a few other budget and smaller-cap airlines. 

As far as I can tell, the only reason it hasn't risen is because European nations have had a much more difficult time recovering travel-wise. Different restrictions to countries, as well as the British government putting the United States on the red-list because of a high COVID danger, means that they can't generate as much revenue. 

I'm trying to understand what investors aren't seeing in ICAGY that they saw in companies like Jetblue and United? Well established airlines that are a little further in their recovery cycle than the U.S. ones, but can be just as strong when a recovery is finished. I don't think the British or Spanish governments are going to let their flagship airlines go under. Help me. What am I not seeing here?",njunge,What's the deal with ICAGY?

Simple (maybe noob) question. The majority of investors always say that one should avoid actively managed index funds, because only a small percentage of them manage to beat the market over a long period of time (10+ years).

The majority‘s advice is to invest in passive index funds/exchange traded funds (ETFs). Basically just stick to the market.

I wouldn't know why investors do not seem to like ICAGY as much as other (especially US airlines), but here some food for your thoughts and evaluations:

* Europe is behind the US in vaccination, the majority of EU countries won't finish their vaccination before August/September. That of course reduces margins for recovery of airlines and other tourism-related business.
* It is expected that work travel for business meetings, fairs,  conventions, etc. will be impacted long-term. In Europe for medium-distance travel, fast railways are a viable alternative. Some governments such as France are also planning to ban domestic flights where a fast-train alternative exists for environmental reasons (of course this is France and not the UK or Spain, but it gives an idea of some policies floating around here in Europe).

This has pushed some competitors to file suit to the EU General Court, as according to them these measures may infringe competition rules. In one case in particular the General Court sided with the plaintiff (Ryanair) against KLM (Dutch airline) and TAP (Portuguese airline). [Reuters article here](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/eu-court-backs-ryanair-challenge-klm-tap-state-aid-2021-05-19/). 
* Last but not least, Europe much stronger social protection for workers. That means that big companies such as Iberia could not simply lay off personnel in 2020 and wait for better times. The Antitrust approved the deal (to be completed this summer), it also demanded Iberia cede certain route slots they had in common with Air Europa to avoid creating quasi-monopoly for those routes. Moreover, Air Europa did receive more than € 400M in state aid last year and the Spanish government is still financing part of Iberia costs by contributing to personnel salaries (an employment protection instrument called ERTE in Spain). Competitors might asks the courts to assess whether those aids are still *kosher* given the merger.

To sum all this up, analysts think that air traffic won't resume its pre-pandemic volumes before 2024 here in Europe. I have no basis nor knowledge to assess how accurate these estimation may be.

To sum all this up, analysts think that air traffic won't resume its pre-pandemic volumes before 2024 here in Europe. I have no basis nor knowledge to assess how accurate these estimations may be.

My two, very personal, cents is that the current price is probably undervaluing the company, but also that post-pandemic effects, coupled with consumers' behavior and sentiment changes, will prevent European airlines to soar again for quite some time.",,

You'd have to look at the beginning of the stock market, and the volatility that came with social adoption of a new way of transacting business interests. That's kind of what crypto is going through right now. Same with electric cars and other tech infrastructure. Adoption is really hard, but as long as you don't give up eventually the world forgets you're trying to adopt something you've been using for 10 years now.

That's what Cathie Wood is banking on. She's planning on holding stuff other businesses don't seem interested in allowing to fail. Tesla might be a trash company run by a solipsistic dildo with hair plugs - but as long as people pretend Elon is cool and they want to buy his cars... 10 years down the road we'll forget we were fighting this tooth and nail.

1. Let's say I need to put 6k in an additional in a separate Vanguard account each year until the target - what am I taxed each year, is it only on earnings?
2. Do the online ""calculators"" do a good job to estimate how much I will need to live off? The simulator is set to working until 60 and dying at 100, living off 85% of current income, etc. That seems so vague to me and doesn't really take lifestyle choices, mortgage, etc. into consideration.
3. Is there anything else I need to consider before throwing in this extra thousands of $ to meet my target goal based on their simulator? What if one day I need to take money out of the taxable?",njwzvr,Vanguard - Additional Funding on top of IRA to Meet Target

https://www.enerdynamics.com/Energy-Currents_Blog/The-Revenue-Requirement-is-the-Key-to-How-Utilities-Make-Money.aspx

My advice:
- Avoid wildfire risk states (West coast mainly) 
- Public utilities have the most to benefit IMO.
- NE had a great run but I think other utilities that have historically been a bit dirtier in their energy have more room to the upside.
- Avoid states with nasty politics against their energy space. California, NY are bad. NJ, Michigan, Midwest are good. All red states good.
- Best pick are companies that anchor lots of jobs to their city. They'll get lots of local support from govt. You need to understand that public utilities can only make as much $$$ as their municipality allows...so this is very important. 
- Don't discount a utility for having lots of debt. That's literally the name of the game...they need to take on debt to increase their asset base.

Let's also say that you reinvest the dividends and buy more shares. 20 years in the future, you will have many more shares of the dividend-paying stocks than you do of the non-dividend-paying stocks. However, the dividend-paying stocks are worth much less than the non-dividend-paying. The total value of each would be equivalent (To make up some random numbers, perhaps you end up with 350 shares of the dividend-paying stock, worth $1 each, and 100 of the non-dividend-paying, worth $3.50 each. Both are worth $350 total).

517,gz9nv4n,2021-05-24 13:00:35,t1_gz9nv4n,t3_njwzvr,investing,"There is a lot that should be said/asked here, but I'll try to touch on some of the more important things. This might also be a good post for r/personalfinance depending on the feedback you get here (ex. if this gets removed).

I'm assuming you don't have any high-interest debt to pay off since that should take priority over maximizing retirement accounts. I would also assume you have some sort of emergency fund in place outside of these retirement funds and the funds you're trying to invest. However, your question of ""what if one day I need to take money out of the taxable"" makes me second-guess this. In theory, you should have an emergency fund available with enough saved up to cover a couple months of expenses, and that would ""shield"" you from having to take out of the taxable.

That also ties in with your question about taxes. If you only invest and never sell/withdraw, then your tax exposure should be minimal. Holding stocks does not create a taxable event, but selling them does (along with any dividends or capital gains disbursements). When selling, you are only taxed on your earnings (ex. if you invest $6k, it grows to $7k, and you sell it all, only $1k is taxable). Same with dividends... if you invest $6k and dividends are paid at say 2%, only those dividend payments are taxable ($6k*2% = $120 taxable).

I don't know how reliable the calculators are, I would guess some might be more reliable than others, and it probably depends a lot on your particular situation (how risky are the things you're invested in, how much you'll need, when you'll need it, etc.). I don't have all of your answers, but thought the info above was worth sharing.",,

Analyst Will Nance initiated coverage of the cryptocurrency exchange on Monday with a buy rating, saying in a note to clients that Coinbase is the best way to gain exposure to cryptocurrency ecosystems.

Coinbase went public through a direct listing on April 14 and, after an initial pop, its shares have struggled. The stock rose above $400 during that first day of trading, but on Friday closed near $224.

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/24/coinbase-stock-initiation-goldman-sachs.html

More from SA

* Goldman Sachs analyst Will Nance initiates coverage of Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN) with a Buy rating partly on its business model that ""thrives on elevated cryptocurrency volatility.""
* That volatility has been on display in recent weeks as seen in crypto swings as evidenced in bitcoin's wild ride. This morning bitcoin rises to $37.6K but had dropped as low as $31.1K on Sunday.
* COIN stock rises 3.0% in premarket trading.
* Sets price target at $306; implies a 36% upside potential for stock based on Friday's closing price of $224.35.
* Nance also likes COIN's leverage to an ecosystem with strong growth driven by increasing adoption of digital currencies, its consumer platform with strong customer acquisition trends and rapidly growing institutional business, and its opportunities to add additional features and capabilities.
* Though the continued success or failure of crypto as an asset class will ultimately determine COIN's future, ""we believe COIN represents a blue-chip way through with to invest in the development of the ecosystem,"" the analyst writes.
* Points to COIN's careful approach to regulatory compliance, crypto-native technology stack, and role as an innovation hub for new crypto endeavors.
* Nance's Buy rating is more optimistic than the average SA Author's rating of Neutral (6 Bullish, 5 Neutral, 2 Bearish) and aligns with the average Wall Street rating of Bullish (6 Very Bullish, 1 Bullish, 4 Neutral).
* Last week, Coinbase snagged an Outperform rating at Wedbush helped by its ""first mover"" advantage.

It is a company that deal with handicap accessibility throughout North America and now Europe. They have some very nice numbers across the board. I bought in at around 17$ CAN (a few months ago), and it's currently above 19$ CAN. They pay a dividend yield of around 2.7% (for current price) which is paid out monthly (Which is great for those living off their earnings). I am watching for the next dip to invest more. 

Savaria has recently bought out a handicap accessible company out of Europe, and is growing at a good pace.

I care far more about the underlying assets of the company - and if I am planning for a major credit related event - I'd probably want stocks that should do well in a recession like Walmart, Coca-Cola, McDonalds (though perhaps their leasers go belly-up), probably some tobacco/alcohol stocks, Pepsico.",,

However, if you are hell-bent on investing in an Index fund/ETF, then I would highly recommend that you ""Dollar Cost Average"" (DCA) into one.  Yo can do this by buying an equal dollar amount each time you make a purchase.  And I would recommend that you space out your purchases to give you a broad timeframe to reach full investment.

Example:

1) Make ""monthly"" purchases of the Index.

2) If the market corrects, you can accelerate your purchases in order to DCA your Cost Basis DOWN.

3) Make monthly purchases of between $3000$4000 so that you can spread your DCA over the next 24+ months.  This will likely give you the best chance of avoiding loss in the event of a near-term market correction.

696,,2021-05-24 15:05:48,t3_nk02im,,investing,"According to BofA's monthly Global Fund Manager Survey published last Tuesday, ""higher inflation is now the consensus."" And furthermore ""inflation is now again the biggest risk for markets,"" as initially identified by 35% of the survey's 194 respondents who manage a combined $592 billion worth of assets. But if investors are broadly concerned about inflation, it suggests stock prices are likely already reflecting these risks and investors have discounted, or priced in, inflation risk into the markets. While it may not be a perfect analog, it's worth considering what happened during the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. 

On March 17, 2020, BofA's Global Fund Manager Survey identified ""Coronavirus"" as its biggest tail risk, and it remained on the top fo the list for the next 10 months as data consistently and persistently reflected an economy in a state of emergency. But the S&P 500 prices bottomed on March 23, 2020. 

In other words, the market had priced in the coronavirus recession and discounted the pandemic's worst financial impacts by mid-March, but this risk still remained the consensus worry among investors for another year. 

The threat of inflation is the most known risk in the markets right now. And so investors should consider the likelihood that the downside of inflation has been priced in.

""Unlike recent cycles, we acknowledge that inflation tail-risk is higher and that inflation data could get hotter before normalizing,"" JPMorgan's Dubravko Lakos-Bujas said. ""This outcome, at the same time, is getting increasingly priced-in as essentially every investor we have spoken to in recent weeks is well aware of this backdrop.""

According to Google, search interest in ""inflation"" is at an all-time high. The University of Michigan's recent survey of consumers revealed sentiment got dinged in May due to unusually elevated concerns about inflation in the years to come.

On the corporate side, a record number of S&P 500 (^GSPC) companies have discussed ""inflation"" on earnings calls as executives just can't stop talking about higher costs.

Whether or not inflation actually becomes a major problem for the economy will only be known in hindsight. And despite folks arguing that recent upticks in price represent ""transitory"" concerns and ""reopening quirks,"" this debate is likely to rage on for months especially as high-profile skeptics sound alarms.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inflation-risk-consensus-priced-in-markets-morning-brief-095840283.html",nk02im,Inflation risk is now the consensus trade. It is priced into equities already. Stocks will likely rally if further data shows inflation is indeed transitory.

PUBLISHED MON, FEB 12 20188:30 AM ESTUPDATED WED, FEB 14 20182:23 PM EST

The inflation tax has a fantastic ability to simply consume capital. ... If you feel you can dance in and out of securities in a way that defeats the inflation tax, I would like to be your broker — but not your partner.” '

873,,2021-05-16 03:30:20,t3_ndfhbz,,investing,"I am typically a value oriented investor and focus heavily on valuations.  Fundamentals on Google are sound: strong recurring revenue base, monopolistic tendencies, value add to customer, network effects, cross selling across revenue streams etc.  I find it hard to argue that Google is going anywhere anytime soon.

Valuation wise, many think that FAANG is overpriced.  Some of it is.  Google trades at a whopping 37x earnings! But only 24x forward.  And only 15x fwd EV/EBITDA.  That is the metric I will focus on for now as I tend to use DCF models with EV/EBITDA terminal values.  The average EV/EBITDA multiple over the last 10 years is about 16x.  The lowest was 10x and 10x is the lowest it ever traded since IPO.  Using a DCF model and using ultra bear scenario of the following assumptions: 2022-2025 revenue growth of 0% annually (yes, correct),  gross margins of 55% (below the 10 year average of 60%), operating margin of about 23% (10 year average 25%), D&A constant at 8% of revenue, Capex in line with Bloomberg estimates approx 16-17% of revenue, and change in NWC of about -3% (consistent with last 4 years).  WACC is 9.5% and used a 10x exit multiple.  This estimates an intrinsic value of $2068, about -9% from current values.  And that is the bear case with ultra bearish assumptions.

The base case then with revenue growth of 10%, same margins, higher depreciation based on consensus estimates, and an exit multiple of the 10 year average of 16x yields a price of $4831, upside of 112%.

Of course, I never truly depend on a DCF model to provide an exact price because there are so many assumptions that will never play out as expected, but it is a great tool to identify what factors impact price and some worst case scenarios.  It is further evidence to me that Google is one of the most undervalued large caps with a wide moat around its largest product, expanding its range and interconnectivity of its products constantly, and generating a significant amount of cash in the meantime.

Let me know your thoughts.

Edit: Cant disagree more with the Mod post below.  EV/EBITDA is a widely accepted method of DCF analysis especially when comparing firms with varying amounts of leverage.  EV/EBITDA is a terminal multiple used to estimate a value for the company at the end of the forecasting period.  The forecasting period still uses FCFF.  I find it weird that these mods can just post their OPINION on these threads and state it as if it is a FACT.  All of my thesis and modeling is clearly opinion and open to discussion, where the Mod is not for whatever reason.",ndfhbz,GOOGL - What am I missing?

So for most of that time period, the Fed has tended to focus primarily on the ""low inflation"" part of its mandate at the expense of the ""low unemployment"" part.

That led to an incredibly slow, sluggish economic recovery post-2008. People graduated from college unable to find jobs, and those who had jobs got very little by way of raises. The result was a populist backlash that led to millions of Americans embracing politicians like Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders who promised to put people back to work and stick it to the ""elites"" whose policymaking decisions had left them out of work or poor. 

There is now a general consensus that the Fed raised rates wayyy sooner than it should have in the mid-2010s. They were worried about inflation when they should have been looking more at why real wages weren't rising and why labor force participation wasn't higher.",,

Their Q1 2020 vs. Q1 2021 numbers tell the whole story. The key is they don't take a flat rate per trade/withdrawal etc, they take a  *percentage*. So bull = more profit, bear = less profit, all other things held equal.  
Also transacting users, rather than just a total number of users, rises to a huge degree in a bull market. They went from 34M users in Q1 2020 to 56M users in Q1 2021, so call it 60% user growth. But *transacting* users, those making at least one transaction per month, went from 1.3M in Q1 2020 to 6.1M in Q1 2021. So almost 5x due to the bull market. Trade volume also went from $30B to $89B in that span.  
Couple all that with BTC going from $6k or so to $60k or so across that one year span and you see why their profits went from $32M in Q1 2020 to $771M in Q1 2021. Those numbers can absolutely not be explained away by the increase in user base/transacting users, it also largely comes from the price of the assets being significantly higher.

2) Strike date elapses, and now that everyone has locked in the dividend payment, money rushes out and the price drops rapidly

First of all while it was quite a substantial crash recently, it was not unexpected. I thought we'd be trading between 40-50k for a few months but instead it looks like we'll be between 30-40k. The growth so far this year was not sustainable. We were far too extended from the 20 week MA. Last cycle we rode it all the way up until a blow off top. The cycle before, in 2013, we got too far extended & when we finally tested it, we fell below it, that was the forming of the first peak in a double peak cycle. Then we had months of consolidation before blasting off again, reaching a blow off top & then a sustained bear market. 

A similar thing just happened. We were so far above the 20 week that when we tested it we fell below it. Falling below it means alt coins get wrecked. Part of the reason you see so much fear online & in r/cryptocurrency is because a surprising amount of people own no BTC & go all in on alts. Which is a terrible idea. When BTC drops significantly the alts get destroyed & people who thought they were getting rich quick start to panic because they're losing money badly. There are even more similarities between 2013 & now. The guy I mainly get my content off has been predicting a double peak cycle for months now & he's not the only one. The intra-cycle volatility between this cycle & the last has been very similar to what occurred between 2013 & the one before it, which is where the suspicions of a double peak originally came from & so far it's playing out. 

I realise all of this probably is worthless without charts so I'll move on.

The asset class is maturing & things are of course overvalued, but they're been way more overvalued at times in the past. There is very clearly diminishing returns & reduced volatility over time, but it's years off reaching a stage where it flattens out. The utility in crypto improves year after year & Blockchain is an industry disrupting technology for many industries. I'm not a bitcoin maximalist but I am a crypto maximalist & the likes of xxx, XXX & xxx are going nowhere for years to come. Most alts are worthless but during a bear market the ones that actually do something tend to be ridiculously undervalued (xxx at 2c last year now at 1.5 & previously well over 2, xxx at 0.002 last year now at 0.10 & previously at 0.28.)
Then in a bull market they get ridiculously overvalued. Overall the asset class reached I think a 4x from its previous cycle peak when BTC was at 60k. Even with diminishing returns that is well below what anyone predicted. There was also no blow off top which will come at some stage. A period where greed reaches its peak, instead we just put in new ATHs 3k above the previous for a few months before the crash.

II interest is not going away & has only been increasing in the past few months but what investor wants to buy a 60k BTC? The likes of Grayscale & MicroStrategy will, but their average buy is already way lower than most else & they're in it for the real long haul. To move to 100k IIs are needed & those who were interested but didn't act because the price is too high for an entry point. Now they've got a great entry point below the average buy of the likes of Tesla. 

I'm gonna stop now, I'm sure if you have no interest in crypto then it seems like nonsense rambling but if you see BTC hit 100k or more then know that during the bear market that follows, whenever it comes, you have a great opportunity to buy undervalued solid projects & make fantastic returns.

Perhaps an easier way to phrase it would be: if I bought an equal spread of shares across 10 dividend payers, would I recoup my principle over time? Having 10 companies would allow for a few of them to cut dividends, and the other to raise them to off-set the variability.

There are surely exceptions (I'll note that $T has been mentioned in the thread about 100 times lol), but overall I feel that statement holds.

Want to get your annual ~7% long term? Stick to your typical MSCI World ETF and you'll be fine. If you're concerned about the US Dollar, maybe put that moeny in ETFs that are priced in EUR for example.

Want to put less money on the US market? Well you can certainly do that with regional ETFs, just look at the unstoppable S&P500 the past decades. Hard to beat that, looking back.

Want to (try to) outperform the market? We'll for me I put a big chunk of my portfolio on a few selected German companies (I'm from there) that I feel like I have a better insight into and that I hope will outperform the market. Ofc that means more work for research. Maybe you have reason to believe that a certain countries economy is going to go full bull run fairly soon? Put your money there. If you have that insight. Live with the risk of underperformance. 

You don't want to put all your money into stocks? Fair enough. Real Estate and Gold should also be fine long term. Ofc with less expectes results in terms if performance. What you get is more safety. Looking back, you would have been better of (again, longterm) with just stocks.

Most gold mines are not located in USA. So you aren't really exposed to dollars. You think you are because your broker calculates a simplified exposure based on the currency you bought the stock with, it is a simple calculation, but incorrect. 

For exemple if you buy 10 shares of the German Bundesbank in the New York stock exchange your broker says you are exposed to dollars, if you buy 10 shares of the German Bundesbank in the German stock market it will say you are exposed to Euro. But in both cases you hold the exact same stock and your exposure is the same.

Real exposure depends on where the company assets are located, the currency the customers pay with and the currency the suppliers are paid with, and many other things. Not what currency you used to buy the stock.",,

Except when it has crashed 70%+

Crypto has grown because knowledge of it grew. I got started with it in 2013 and back then no one knew what it was. You went to message boards, and there was lots of discussion about the technology behind blockchains and purpose.

Fast forward to 2021, and EVERYONE knows what crypto is. You have celebrities selling NFTs and people paying millions for them, and apps like RH making it super easy to 1 click buy without having to handle setting up a wallet, backups, etc, and institutional involvement as well. You have Coinbase running ads saying ""If you bought bitcoin 10 years ago instead of that coffee you'd be a millionaire now"". Obviously these returns have drawn people in seeking to get rich quick. It's not a pyramid scheme as it's just a decentralized technology, but its valuation effectively functions like one.

Go to any message board, the boards are flooded with people talking about price.

It doesn't get much more extreme than this. Unless fiat currencies totally collapse globally, it won't take off.",,
