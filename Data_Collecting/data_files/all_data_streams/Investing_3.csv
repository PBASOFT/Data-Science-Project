I'm new to investing in stocks, and would really appreciate your help.  
  
I keep hearing how the current market is likely to be overvalued and all signs are pointing to a bubble. Analysts are warning it could be worse DotCom bubble, etc, with companies propped up on stimulus money despite the troubles of Covid. Apparently Warren Buffet and others have all suggested we will soon see a bear market, but it's impossible to know whether that will be next week or 2030.  
  
With that in mind, my current strategy is value investing for a 1 to 2 year window. I'm looking for massively undervalued stocks (currently my main pick is VIAC) and putting my money there, with the idea that they will outperform the indexes when the dip happens in future.  
  
After the dip, I'd love to go long-term and buy the SNP, chuck in some AAPL and MSFT and some electric car ETFs, but I'm worried if I do that now the arse will fall out of this thing and I'll be left buying at the top of a collapsed market.

An active investor doesn't buy the whole market. They buy a subset. It is trivial that there exists subsets of a population  such that the means of those sunsets exceed the mean of the population.

The question that does remain is whether you are able to identify an active manager who can pick such subsets. And for me, the answer to that is ""No"".

I don't think that anybody is wrong doing managed funds or index funds.  The way to wealth is long term with controlled behavior from yourself or an advisor/coach rather than the right stock or funds.


American Funds in general is like a grandfather ""managed"" account a lot more diversified usually.  Typically they stay 15% or under per industry and usually caps at around 5% in any companies holdings 


The other two funds are more tech oriented with a bit more aggressive management style.


While at any point the holdings of the funds might be similar my strategy is 50% diversified equity mutual fund that has a buy and hold strategy for a lot their holdings which allows for lower management fees (think of this as my index fund in a way)


The other 50% is a more actively managed fund that I am going to ""try"" to get higher returns on.  Though typically long term the buy and hold wins, if I am rebalancing every quarter I can try to move some of those more aggressive earnings to my American funds account. (this is my higher risk mutual fund that I am taking an extra 0.4% fee on hoping I can get a little extra return. Like my 68% last year on fagax and 30% on agthx.  Well worth the 0.4% that year.

Stocks don't move like barrels in a river. There's no way to react ahead of time to what's ahead (without insider information), because by the time you see it, everyone else has, and the price already reflects the effect. And selling every time after a crash is the best way to loose money long term.

>but at least there's a small chance that the manager could see it coming and reposition

Being able to see a crash coming would be an amazing ability, but not a single person in all of investment history has been able to predict all of them, while not making incorrect predictions about crashes that never happen (i.e. there are some people who predict a crash every few months, so of course they predicted all the crashes). If your fund manager ""sees a waterfall up ahead"", and repositions, maybe he got it right, and makes you money, maybe he gets it wrong, and looses you money. It's a toss up either way. The amount of crashes they avoid would be proportional to the amount of time they spend out of the market. If you want a low volatility, low return investment, there are indexes for just that.",,

Some general ""rules of thumb"" I use for leveraged ETF investing:

1.) Keep the leverage to well-diversified indices: S&P, Russell 2000, Midcap 400. Anything else (sector investing, for example) is a gambling due to idiosyncratic risk (factor risk, sector risk, etc.).

2.) Only bet money you can literally forget about. In a bad year, your holding might go down 80% or more. Most people can't stomach that and hold but you \*have to\* if you want to succeed long term with leveraged ETFs  
  
3.) Stick to **less** than 2.5x leverage for long term holding. I only do 2x for true long-term. Various academic papers have looked at the optimal amount of daily leverage for risk adjusted returns and once you cross the 2x-2.5x range you start to get worse returns over time because the volatility is too high. 

4.) Stay away from sector leveraged ETFs or 3x ETFs unless you're hedging or holding (relatively - weeks, *maybe* months) short term. The sector stuff I've already explained -the 3x leveraged indices can become unrecoverable (99% loss) if you get caught in a prolonged downturn. That's extremely unlikely with 2x but would have happened in some instances with 3x ETFs (TQQQ would have been wiped out by the dot-com bubble burst.",,

So, I decided to take some time off.  I had been working for 15 years until that point and have done a good job saving aggressively and investing. The plan was to take a couple months off and then start looking for another job - the vision was it to be a total of 6 months of sabbatical.  It so happened to be that the pandemic hit and my unemployment ended up going a lot longer. However, even though not working for an employer, I am actually doing a quite a lot of things day to day. I have picked up some freelance consulting, I own an investment residential property which I rent out for 2x return (rent compared to mortgage) that I have now taken the responsibility to do the property management (instead of hiring someone), I have picked up on trading options and I have done well with my stock choices (I guess everyone has since the market was in such a crazy bull run) but I have exited many stocks with 3 or 4x returns. I have also lost on a few but the net gain has been solid.  I also have an additional source of income through dividend stocks.  All together, while it might seem to an outside viewer that I am doing nothing, I am actually doing a lot. 

I have enjoyed my day to day life quite a bit doing all of these various things and I actually have made more than enough money to cover my expenses and have money left over for savings and discretionary income.  Is there anyway that I could consolidate all of these activities under some sort of an investment company? Or a holding company? Or perhaps an LLC? If my rental property continues to do well, I would ideally love to add another one. My options trading has also been a secure sense of basic income because I use very low risk strategies which allows me to make modest gains off of my options trading. It all adds up of course, and along with the free lance consulting, I believe I am making enough money for the time being. But, it would be nice to make all my activities into something consolidated and more professional. This way, if and when I do return to applying for jobs, it would also look better on my resume to consolidate all this work into some sort of professional entity instead of just describing all the various activities I was doing when unemployed.

I would appreciate any advice anyone has for me. I am aware that many of these investment activities can go up and can go down and that is why I want to retain the prospect of again applying to jobs at some point.",nfpy1v,Forming an investment company or other options to consolidate my various investment activities during unemployment?

It was only really devastating for those who tried to time the market and entered with a  big pile of uninvested cash right at the very height of the mania. Anyone who invested steadily through the 80s and then kept putting money in after the crash came only had 1 or two years of contributions that lost significant value and if they were doing standard “lazy” investing that would be offset by the purchases they made at the very very bottom.

Sucks for anyone who was planning to retire right in 1992-4, but they had 40 damn years of 15%+ returns on the market, their accounts were not accurate and it may have fucked up their planning, but they definitely didn’t get a bad deal considering the insanely consistent growth for *decades* leading up to the crash.",,

PFMT price Target= $8  (low end)

Despite the ongoing rally in the broad market, this stock continues to be insanely undervalued.... but the window of opportunity to own it at current levels is closing.  I wont go over old news, the original DD link can be found below.  This post lays out immediate short term catalysts that will attract institutional investor attention to the name leading to a multiple re-rate higher. 

&#x200B;

....

&#x200B;

On May 13 the company reported earnings. The stock reaction has been muted due to low volume. The intense volatility in the name has slowed, as a FEW sophisticated  investors have accumulated meaningful starter positions (emphasis on only a few).  The earnings release and recent news has addressed and alleviated the lingering concerns by investors over:

\-Student loans business- Contracts are being sold off.  Company will focus on healthcare business

\-Debt- covenents have been renegotiated into more favorable terms. Proceeds from sale of Student Loans contracts will be used to pay off some debt to the point of easily manageable levels

\-Healthcare business- continues to grow. More contracts secured. Mgmt also confirmed a robust pipeline of new contracts in the works. Margins expected to be 30% sustainably once we re-open

&#x200B;

Like everyone, the quarter was impacted by covid. no surprise. The first unaffected quarter will be rockstar- hitting the screens of all investors that are currently unaware. As a turnaround story these companys cannot be easily found.

&#x200B;

1)

On the conference call, we see for the first time two institutional investor participants.

Chris Krug- Chatham Harbor Capital (AUM unknown)

and

Craig Melcher- Tudor Investment Corporation (AUM 45B+, even small cap funds would have significant size)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

During the conference call, these investors asked critical questions ot which management provided reassuring feedback and responses. What we draw fomr this is that new players in the institutional landscape are vocally following this name.

&#x200B;

2)

A few days ago, the institutionally well-followed podcast known as The Contrarian Investor Podcast recently hosted an episode with Chris Krug above. (Link: [https://contrarianpod.com/](https://contrarianpod.com/)) in which Chris pitches PFMT as a table punding buy. Fast forward to 15 minutes 40 seconds. I recommend everyone listen to this pitch as he does an excellent job of simplifying a complicated company. Especially helpful for those sitting on the fence unsure whether to buy stock.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

3)

An exclusive online investing network known as CoInvestor Club ([https://coinvestorclub.com/](https://coinvestorclub.com/)) , followed by a many of NOrth Americas top hedgefund, micro/small/mid-cap portfolio managers, and high networth accredited investors has recently announced in their weekly newsletter and posted on twitter (@CoINvestorCLub1) that they will be hosting Chris Krug TOMORROW Wednesday May 19 to present his BEST investment idea- no other details shared.  Given the recent events, it is very likely that Chris continues to pitch PFMT. Volume uptick into the close today confirms this could be the case.

&#x200B;

These new investors see the underlying value in Performant and have clearly done a thorough due dilligence. Expect a sophisticated educational campaign to initiate in the insitutional investing world. These are no longer small retail investors but large funds that will push the price much higher. Tomorrows presentation is only the begining. Expect many value and micro cap investors to be tuning in. Once PFMT is confirmed to be the best idea, expect a pop in the price. As well as continued spreading through word of mouth, mgmt appearing at investor conferences to generate exposure to investors. This was a $1B market cap company not too long ago.  This could be the last opportunity to buy this turnaround company at cheap levels before the coming multiple re-rate bring it to $8+ or it gets acquired at a significant  premium.",nfqeqy,"$PFMT- Performant - Is About to be on everyones radar, going to $8"

Economists =/= not investors. Not even close. 

>One 50% bad day might not happen but many red days will, each eroding your mlney until it's pointless.

Not how leveraged ETFs work. Almost all of them reset daily...and no bear market is made up of only red days. In fact, bear markets are significantly closer to 50/50 (as far as what % of days are red vs. green) than bull markets; they would have to be since markets go *up* over time. Case in point: the U.S. stock market has had 59% green days when you take into account *the last 145 years of data.*

A regular bull market - you know, those things that happen before and after bear markets? - lasts *years* which more than makes up for the downturns.

> and each red day erases 2-5x your money depending on leverage. To even get back to 0 you'd need 4-10x upside!

I've only advocated for long term holding **2x leveraged well-diversified indices** in this thread, but nice strawman. 

>Just tell me how many leveraged ETFs do you find taht survived '08, the last real crash? Ah, Zero? 

Citation? Because the first two 2x leveraged ETFs I looked up, SSO and QLD, have been around since 2006 and performed very well if held since then (and through 2 sharp downturns). So I'd love to hear how you came up with ""zero"" as your answer since that's demonstrably false.  

Notably, barely any levered ETFs *existed* prior to 2005 (most of them only started in the last decade, before '08 even happened) but I'm sure given your deep, serious research you already knew that. 

>Let's look at all leveraged ETFs through history and see all went broke in the end. Almost as if it doesn't work over long periods of time. When you take a loss you need to get 2x more upside to get back to ground zero. With a leveraged fund you'll most likely bleed out before you get in green again.

I understand that your intuition lead you to believe that a 2x levered fund would ""most likely bleed out"" since they ""all went broke"" except when we look at [145 years of U.S. stock market data we can actually synthesize how a 2x levered, daily resetting ETF would perform.](http://ddnum.com/articles/leveragedETFs.php)

Spoiler alert: **over the entire history of the U.S. stock market, a 2x levered daily-resetting ETF would have failed exactly** **0 times** and produces a significantly better CAGR than an un-levered portfolio. In fact, we can see that this would also be the case with most major domestic & foreign indices (to varying degrees, sometimes the optimal leverage is closer to 1.5 or 3) with only the Nikkei as an exception. 

So even though *a guy on reddit said a bunch of economists said it's obviously bad idea* I'm content trusting the relatively simple math and retiring a decade early.

I didn't go full inspector Clouseau, but I looked at the local dealers website and filtered for new inventory, there are three within the 50 mile range and two of them said they had 300 vehicles available and the other had 150.  I actually had errands to run in town so I took a slightly longer route and drove by the area where a bunch of dealerships are.  To my (possibly biased) eyes, it looked like the other brands had all their cars lined up along the road and a lot of unusually empty parking lot behind them (I hope my measly 28 shares wouldn't bias me too badly, but it's hard to avoid).  The Toyota and Lexus lots looked full.  

Part of the earnings call I didn't quote kind of explained why they were prepared

>""And also, we worked on the supply chain as well. 10 years ago, when we had the Great East West \[Phonetic\] Japan Earthquake, together with the suppliers, we made efforts for mitigating disaster efforts and also we adjusted inventory levels.

I think this is a time to sell a car while inflation is in the news (people might expect to have to pay more next year) and interest rates are still low (and people may worry that they will go up).  The Brand that has what people want in stock may be an advantage.

&#x200B;

Medium term it's all about what people want to by.   I really don't want to throw shade at people who like pure BEVs.  I understand they have a lot of things going for them.  I do however agree with TM here that the infrastructure just doesn't support it as a mass market vehicle yet (American who only knows a portion of America so zero insight into the rest of the world).  Charging stations are few and far between, people could have them installed in a garage, but apartment dwellers are kind of out of luck, so are people who rent, and people who travel a lot for work.  I took a week vacation in Florida earlier this year, and neither the hotel in Jacksonville nor Coco beach had a charging station.  Also, when you do the math, to get a large portion of the country in a pure BEV would take something like more than doubling the electrical generation capacity and that takes many years, and for supplying a large number of chargers to a small area (like an apartment building parking lot) would require replacing the standard power lines with higher capacity high voltage power lines and (in America) there is a lot of resistance to putting up a high voltage power line new people.

&#x200B;

Anyway, (I'm not trying to throw shade) I think the key innovation is the plug in hybrid.  Much smaller battery (40 to 60 mile range) plus the nearly perfected Hybrid drivetrain that came from continuous improvements in the Prius.  The Plug in Hybrid is the perfect vehicle for a large percentage of people.  Most trips (work, school or grocery store and back) are within the range of the all electric mode, but zero range anxiety for a vacation or weekend trip.  Right now, Toyota has eight Hybrids, and two of the (Rav 4 and Prius) have a plug in hybrid available.  I think those will continue to expand and be very good sellers.

&#x200B;

The added benefit is the higher gas mileage of the HEVs and PHEVs, meaning the average fleet MPGs goes up and they buy fewer CAFE credits from TSLA improving their margins.  Did you see the Minivan is only sold as a Hybrid model (no standard engine available).

&#x200B;

Long term, I think they are capable of adapting to what the customers want and the BEV will be available when a significant portion of people want one.  That's my reason behind buying 28 shares and wishing it would quit going up so I could buy more.",,

I've now read it. The difference between Sharpe's argument and yours is that you talk about distributions while he talks about averages (or the expected value of distributions).

> From this, it follows (as the night from the day) that the return on the *average* actively managed dollar must equal the market return [an average].

To express what Sharpe says in notation:

WLOG I will summarize all of the weights in the active portfolios as the proportion b of dollars, and let a=1-b such that all dollars are represented by a+b.

R_p = R_m
R_m = aR_p + bR_a
a+b = 1

=>

R_m - aR_p = bR_a
R_p = R_m
a+b = 1

=>

(1-a)R_m = (1-a)R_a

=>

R_m = R_a

This is clearly correct.

But what I'm critizising is not Sharpe's claim, it's your claim, which is substantially different from Sharpe's.

Sharpe makes a claim about the average return of actively (and passively) invested dollars, while you make a statement about the distributions of the returns of actively (and passively) invested dollars.

Sharpe's and my claim are not contradictory. Some subset of dollars can outperform the average as long as the complement of that set underperforms the average correspondingly, and both statements will be correct at the same time.

All you need to do to correct your statement is to not call them distributions, but call them averages, at which point you are correctly citing Sharpe's argument.",,

But by not stating the assumptions that make the conclusion necessarily true, and do not make the argument that they must be equal.

Rather your argument states that given two (identical, as per the stated qualification being identical) distributions up to a negative term for the active distribution, necessarily have different means (in favor of the passive distribution).

While true, it is a different argument than Sharpe's.

Let me write how I read you argument with less words.

Let the market distribution be X_m, all investable securities. (Implied)

Assume X_p ~ X_m

Assume X_a ~ X_m - c

For some cost c > 0

Necessarily E[X_a] < E[X_p]

This is correct per definition, but not Sharpe's argument.

What I criticized about it, as I imagine you see yourself, is that the assumption that X_p ~ X_m - c is going to be hard to motivate.

Now I realize, given that you state it's an attempted quotation of Sharpe, that this is not what you had in mind.

But I argue that is what you wrote.",,

In this case, that idom about results has been proven mathematically. Which, to your point, makes investing in indexes with 100% faith quite dumb.

Especially now when they and the whole stock market are dramatically overvalued. 

People fall prey to all kinds of confirmation bias. Human like to buy, not sell. It's just a psychological fact. They suffer recency bias (as we've recently seen). Our brains look for patterns all the time and make them when they don't exist.

If you flip a coin 10 times and it comes out heads everytime then there is a 50/50.chance it will come out heads or tails on the next flip. People just don't believe things like that.

We're all still quite dumb.

The index funds shit is stupid. It's based on the thinking that ""stocks always go up"".

No they don't. Not in every window of time. If you have 135 years to wait, sure.

And it doesn't work if you invest in companies that don't survive. If you bought and held world.com then, no, stocks didn't always go up.

However, it is not just ESG that would be less diversified, but any active strategy that made a disproportionate bet on sectors for whatever reason would not be fully diversified. I would also say that not all ESG portfolios include exclusions and there are strategies that focus on choosing best in class in a sector. You might argue that ESG factors are not a good proxy for quality of management or that they lead to more resilient companies. I understand your point of view, and the choice of going fully diversified vs. some form of active selection (even if done via setting criteria in an index) is a matter of philosophy. I personally have put my faith in indices and passive investing for years. However, I believe that are perhaps seeing only a portion of the ESG approaches that are out there and that there are indeed ones that are not built on exclusions as much as a hypothesis about factors that will have an outsized influence on the development of industry sectors and companies. Whether or not these can outperform a market portfolio over time likely depends on whether or not wrenching transitions occur that lead to rapid devaluations of some sectors.

However, there should be a very clear distinction in our minds between a generic actively managed portfolio and an ESG portfolio: active portfolios are (always) designed to achieve a return or risk objective that benefits their investors financially. If ESG has any risk or return upsides in a particular time, it is completely coincidental because they are not designed with that objective.  Underperforming consistently by design is completely consistent with the design of an ESG fund, but it is not consistent with that of any other fund.

It’s not clear to me why people are so comfortable with the 10% nominal/8% real estimate for equity returns just based on history. We’re in a different environment with an artificially low risk-free rate.

Real risk-free yields today are at -0.88% (interpolated 10-year tips). The historical average equity risk premium in the US had been 5.6%. This implies a 10-year expected real return to equities of 4.72%, which seems more reasonable to me.

That’s without going down the path of forecasting what the risk premium should be in the future. Models of equity risk premium and implied risk-aversion suggest that 5.6% ERP is too high. That risk premium would imply an exceptional level of risk aversion.

Long story short, I think people should expect lower future equity returns.",,

Millennials have always had a rough go of it. Largely due to debt. Devaluing the dollar actually reduces Millennial debt burden at the cost of Boomer assets. The FED is playing on a knife's edge of increasing inflation without triggering hyper inflation. They always say their target is 2%, but given the circumstances and the latest data as well as their public statements, I think they're really shooting for a 4-5% range at least temporarily (which is why they keep assuring that it's transitory).

By default, that means that you view the ESG label primarily applies to funds that are intentionally NOT using ESG as a financial investment thesis (e.g., screened funds, etc.). 

I would say that distinction is not universally held and many people that I work with would call a fund that has a formal process for assessing ESG data points as part of the investment process would count as an ESG fund whether the analysis is with an eye to financial materiality or is with an eye to a ""morally superior"" portfolio. But I get your points and believe that we would describe similar choices, but have a difference in which terms we use to delineate them.

I also take your point that the regulation allows for ESG funds that are focused on a financial (investment) thesis and can demonstrate performance. This is a reasonable expectation in principle for any default funds. In practice, there are indeed funds out there which use ESG for a financial thesis and the burden of proof and liability implied by the regulations creates an unintended (or maybe intended) barrier that I think is a bit unreasonable. Taking my 401k as an example, it is chock full of actively managed funds that are clearly not fully diversified, carry comparatively higher expense ratios, and have no apparent logic for their inclusion. I would rather see the DoL fix the standards by which all actively managed funds are selected and the ESG problem that you are raising solves itself. I am not a fan of targeting those funds with a burden of proof while still allowing administrators to throw in alternative actively managed choices that are arguably not any better than the ESG options which are no longer available. If I am going to risk under-performance due to insufficient diversification by the fund manager, then I would rather that it is on a strategy of my choosing than on one of these expensive large-cap funds with snappy marketing patter about their superior insights yet underperforms the benchmark. So I get the intent, but believe that it could have been framed better and misses the real issues - namely, improve the selection process for all funds and give people lots of options to choose what best fits their preferences on how to deploy their own capital.",,

That's more than Apple, Microsoft, Amazon combined. 3 companies which collectively have about $800 billion a year in revenue. Apple and Microsoft each make more profit in a year, than Tesla's total revenue. Each.

But sure, if you're privy to something that most people aren't, and $6,000 is the number - load up on $1,725 calls. Looking at Jan 2022, it's $3.10 (x100), $310 total and you'd make about $4,275 (x 100) = $427,500 in profit if it hits $6,000 by then.

This isn't realistic, this is several standard deviations out of the expected move. The market is pricing in a less than 1% shot of Tesla hitting $1,725 by then.

Deep out the money LEAPs are maximum leverage, but not maximum expected profit. Expected return is -99.X% on something like a $1,725 call.

483,,2021-05-19 04:33:09,t3_nfw182,,investing,"Hello everyone, I’ve been investing for about 2 years (almost 20 years old) and I’ve dumped an ungodly amount of money in Fidelity and Vanguard index funds. I’ve recently (6 months ago) started to get into individual stocks and options, which I do on another brokerage solely as playing around and learning better strategies. While I do use multiple news sources for information about stocks in order to help me predict where the stock will go, I was wondering if you have any mobile apps which can allow me to browse news about stocks and etc. I have tried SEEKINGALPHA and a few other apps but have found that it does not really do what I intended. Do you have any primary mobile app used solely for news and finding stock picks (screeners and etc). Thank you, all responses are useful.",nfw182,Where do you get your news for investing?

1) I don't ""expect"" as in sure thing, I do think the most likely outcome of the next 20 years will be similar to some 20 year period in the market, I'd take pretty much any of them over the alternative of not investing. 


I operate in the world of selling my best guess with confidence.  I used to sell speculation of ""well I'm not sure what the market will do, we hope it continues returning 8-10%""  Well tried to sell at least. 


I recently realized that if I try to get technical with it, the customer isn't interested because they are uncomfortable.  If I just use 8% for 7-14 years, 9% for 15-20, and 10% for 20+, I'm not being slimy in doing so.  If I'm wrong, we are most likely in a better spot then if I scared them out of not starting.  Of course I tell them past performance does not mean future results, but explain that it's my best guess proudly. 


2) active management performs better sometimes worse sometimes.  There are funds that have outperformed the market, there is recency bias, I'm not oblivious to the idea.  I'm not saying they will in the future, but it would also be just as I'll advised, and for an advisor like myself, illegal to say that index funds will outperform managed. The point is, we have no idea, a good, long term, low cost managed fund is not going to break your retirement.  See Agthx, long standing fund, good company, fund managers been there for years, reputable company.



Second, having an advisor makes sense if you include the human variable.  I consider myself more a coach then anything.  Investing money is easy, just buy equity.  Talking people off the ledge of fear selling is one of the things that makes good financial advisors worth it. Not everybody needs it, but you'd be surprised how many people do.  Fear of loss is a big deal, especially as you hit your 50s for most people.


I've sold annuities to people after telling them how it will likely underperform vs mutual funds long term.  Purely because they wanted the peace of mind of a floor.  It's so easy to assume that everybody is like ""us"" in this sub.  The bulk of people are not, they are scared to lose.  It isn't easy to get people to start investing for themselves.  We aren't sitting in the corner trying to trick people.  Lol",,

Also, it pays to remember that future cash flows in a DCF calculation are non-linear with respect to discount rate -- those out-year future cash flows are reduced by high powers of the discount rate.  In this environment, where people are using very low discount rates (2%-4%) in their DCFs to justify the prices of these growth stocks, a small increase in the risk-free rate and a constant equity risk premium can increase the discount rate by 50%-100%, which much more than doubles the impact on the NPV if most cash flows are in the future.  Increased risk-free rate expectations will hammer fundamental valuations of these stocks.  Probably a good argument against a constant equity risk premium.",,

503,,2021-05-19 04:57:05,t3_nfwhkl,,investing,"Halfway through 2021, retail investing has reached a peak volume we have never seen before. In fact, the average amount of trades happening each day has more than doubled since 2019. Trillions of dollars are moved as stocks rise and fall throughout the day. However, even though stock prices change at all hours, US retail traders are restricted to the narrow timeframe of 9:30 AM through 4:00 PM EST.

The restrictive trading hours placed upon retail traders is just one of the many issues with the current system. Some of the other problems have been brought to attention due to recent events, such as the meteoric rise of GameStop stock and Dogecoin. In both cases, many different stock brokerages used by retail traders restricted the buying or selling of specific securities, effectively manipulating the market.

Time and time again we have seen larger investment institutions place rules and regulations on ordinary traders, while giving themselves the freedom to do whatever they want. Our goal? Level the playing field.

**Our vision**

The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) represents a massive amount of wealth and equity. It has a market cap of 26.2 trillion dollars and is easily the largest stock exchange on the planet. However, if you’re able to freely trade with all the stocks within the NYSE, you’re still only able to trade with roughly a third of the global stocks.

There are dozens of other stock exchanges out there using dozens of different currencies. However, the time-zone and currency differences make accessibility difficult. We see a world where anyone can trade on any stock exchange, regardless of their currency, at any time they wish. At first glance, it may seem idealistic, or a far reach. But in reality? It’s already here.

**What is StockSwap?**

StockSwap is the stock market reimagined, with the power of investing held equally by all parties for the first time in history.

On StockSwap, you can purchase any stock you want, just like on any other platform, but without any of the restrictions.

**How does it work?**

StockSwap is possible through the developments of cryptocurrencies and blockchains over the past several years. When you buy a stock on StockSwap, you are exchanging your money for a wrapped cryptocurrency token that is directly tied to and backed by your desired stock, purchased by us. This means you retain voting rights, receive dividends, and keep any other benefit of directly owning the stock yourself.

**How can I start?**

If everything you’ve read so far sounded appealing, that’s fantastic. But while we’d like our platform to be perfect, we’re not quite there yet. Before you can start trading with us, there’s a few things you should know.

**Where are we now**

As we work towards perfecting StockSwap, all trades have a 1% fee placed on them, capping at $10 to help cover our developmental and maintenance costs. We understand nobody wants to pay money to invest and are working on further reducing those fees as we progress, with our ideal scenario consisting of phasing them out completely in the near future.

In addition, while StockSwap is already developed and fully functional, we are still finishing the process of obtaining our broker dealer license. Before completing this step, SEC regulations require the investment portfolio of any potential client to be greater than 10 million USD. This means, while we’re currently serving several dozen clients, it’ll be at least a few more weeks before we’re able to able to help everybody trade freely.

Until then, keep up to date on our progress through our medium and telegram pages. We can’t wait for you to join us on our journey as we reimagine how we invest.

Until next time!",nfwhkl,StockSwap - Investing reimagined

Been investing in a target fund for my Roth for about 2 years but just now getting into the nitty gritty of investing. 

I’m (M) 25 in the US, I was previously employed but now unemployed to do grad school full time. I have a sizable emergency fund that I’ve built to cover monthly costs for a year, and am receiving unemployment benefits that are set to run out soon. I adjusted my emergency fund to be bigger than usual last year because of Covid. I plan on graduating next December and then hoping to get a high-paying wage job in a HCOL area in tech.
Aside from my emergency fund, I have been saving for my wedding, a new car, and a dog under different buckets in my Ally account. My main objectives are for growth since I don’t think I will be spending this money any time soon and ultimately my goal right now is set on finishing grad school. My partner pays for rent and we split other expenses that we share. I do not have any debts to pay and currently I just started investing in a taxable account in a balanced International and domestic index fund.

My question is, what should I do with the money that I have saved up for a new car, dog, wedding that is sitting in my savings account? I predict I’ll be getting married in about 2-5 years, getting a dog in about a year, and contributing to my partners car in about 2-5 years after we get married. I have a pretty high risk tolerance, if my investments go down, I stay the road and invest more or DCA over time. I don’t believe on paying for a down payment on a house in the next 5-7 years since we want to live overseas or in another state for about that time range.

I just have about 10k sitting in a savings account which I thought was smart before, but I feel like I’m missing out on growth and losing to inflation. My current attitude is to no longer contribute to my savings. I pay off my credit cards in full every two weeks and then put the rest to invest or treat myself or my family a little bit every month.

Am I making the right decisions with my money right now? Should I throw the 10k into index funds and just wait it out? I can always sell and withdraw from my taxable account if I desperately need to but I’m trying to avoid short term gains tax. 

What other options do I have? 

Thanks!! 

tl;dr : unemployed grad student set to graduate in a year, accumulated 12 months of emergency fund. Has extra 10k for future expenses but won’t use any of it for at least another year or later. What should I do with this money?",,

Vast majority of my funds are passively managed. HSA is pretty aggressive (for index funds). Vanguard Total stock market, small cap index, total int'l stock market,  Explorer fund. I don't plan on touching this account until I'm 57 1/2. Unless it's an absolute emergency. Assuming I continue to invest the same amount monthly ($100) and the RoR continues at the 10yr average, my HSA will have over 300k in it by the time I retire. Triple tax advantaged. Could it be more with different avenues? Probably, but I'm also limiting my risk and paying ridiculously low fees.

I have a retirement fund through my job. I pay in 9.8% monthly, they match 101%. I can retire at about age 57 with an average of my last 5 years of salary for the rest of my life and get a fat check for any accrued PTO that I didn't use, to which there's no limit. I've had coworkers retire with an entire year's worth of personal days banked and they get written a check for essentially what amounts to a year's salary.

I also have a personal investment account through vanguard with most of my funds there in VFIFX.

I'm in a unique position where any investments I have outside of what I'm paying into my job's retirement will be icing on the cake when I retire. I also have a NEST 529, but I'm only putting $25/mo into that currently as I'm fairly young and don't even have a child yet lol.

As seen in march 2020, a massive crash and prompt recovery to all time highs with over valuations across the board.

Maybe the general population is now educated/aware/deluded enough to smash their money into equity as soon as there's a crash? I.e. better than holding cash.

Thus rendering a genuine, wealth devastating crash of 2008 moot, as a rebound is more likely than not.

What makes a bubble relevant to the average person is 1. If it bursts and they need that equity asap 2. if it doesn't keep following long term trends upwards and faith in the markets disappeared.

I.e. in my position where I'm happy to leave equity for years, I would welcome a crash for cheap entry points!

What would cause a bubble to be an issue is if massive drawdowns happened at once, calling into an issue the narrow ""exit"" of liquidity.

Examples that come to mind of this are pension drawdowns which remain consistently unavailable to the retiree...

VXX holds roughly a 50/50 split of VIX futures expiring in the coming 2 months (ex: half expiring in May,  half in June,  near month gets rolled before it expires).

VIX is a volatility index.  Volatility is an abstract idea,  there's no way to take ownership in VIX directly. 

You can bet on the movement of VIX with futures,  or you can buy an ETF that tracks VIX futures. 

You're playing with a bunch of gamblers when you buy VIX futures of any sort.  They all want the market to crash and volatility to spike... and so they overpay for VIX futures.  Typically VIX doesn't move a whole lot.  Say it's at 20 today and in 1 month it's still 20. VIX futures today might price in a move to 22. You pay 22 today,  it's worth 20 in 1 month when the futures contract expires. You're down 10% even though the ""underlying"" is flat. 

Anything that directly tracks volatility has some sort of time premium built in - a premium due to tail risk of volatility spikes. 

If none of this makes sense,  I'd suggest spending a few hours researching what are options,  what are futures,  what is implied volatility,  theta,  what is VIX, read the VXX prospectus, etc.

Quick and dirty oversimplification: VXX is a short term speculative tool which eventually will decay to zero but occasionally spikes on short timeframes when the market moves faster than expected.",,

Gold is always touted as a store of value, just remember that there are significant transaction costs and storage costs. 

Crypto on the other hand is divorced from direct connection to currencies but has no intrinsic value, so balance of probabilities is most will become worthless but.. they might not. Ethereum seems to be the one with the least speculation attached (and hence volatility), BTC itself is now effectively a store of value so it's probably the other best bet. A little in here.

Real estate retains value until it doesn't, everyone thinks property never drops, it does. Some here is good but try not to make it too much of the total.

Shares in businesses that will continue to be viable in a hyperinflation scenario are good although the market could of course collapse entirely.

Lastly geographic diversity is more important than asset diversity, just because one country's economy fails doesn't mean the entire world will, yes China EU and Japan sell a lot of goods to the US, but don't forget that a lot of debt is denominated in USD, so an awful lot of countries will all of a sudden have their debt burden dramatically reduced (an effective stimulus to their economies). So if you seriously think the US is about to hit hyper inflation start buying assets in countries with a heavy USD denominated debt level (nb that doesn't mean the US owns the debt - the US is a net debtor itself, but a lot of international debt is denominated in USD). 

I'm curious though, what do you think is about to trigger this hyper inflation ?",,

We live in a house and I drive an almost new car. I feel like I can afford almost anything I want. (I can get very creative with the things I want). I have intermediate market knowledge of both crypto and stocks. I can get a floating return of almost 12% medium risk per year. +-2% based on risk. Do you think that I will be able to retire with such a return, and what amount do you think I should be sparing?   
My main question is - Do any of you know something similar to the 401k plan but for Europeans.

Also, it is not simply about how much you have saved, but how much income you can draw from those savings. A rule of thumb is that one will need ~80% of their pre-retirement income to sustain the same lifestyle after they retire.

If you must know how much savings you should have, you can use the ""4% rule."" which says that you can withdraw up to 4% of your retirement savings each year in the retirement without running out. That is, Retirement savings target = Monthly income required x 25

One issue is that I think people got too caught up in very speculative growth themes last year and bought into things like WKHS -- which is now down about 80% since early Feb. That company announced earnings recently and announced that it had delivered 6 trucks. 

Recently SPCE announced that it was not sure when it was going to have its next test flight.  Last year it would have probably been down a bit but bounced because ""Cathy's probably gonna buy more!"" This year it's down 20% in an instant and even Cathy has been selling out of it in her space ETF. (https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/12/cathie-woods-space-exploration-etf-arkx-sells-virgin-galactic-stock.html)

It's okay to have some of your portfolio in aggressive growth, but there also really should be a sizable portion devoted to high quality, profitable and well-managed companies with a long track record. You can have 25 different aggressive growth stocks but that isn't really diversified - if aggressive/disruptive/hyper/whatever growth is out of favor, those are all going to likely be out of favor. 

The Ark-y ""disruptive growth"" had a ""once in a great while"" kind of year last year but when that stopped working in Feb, it stopped working in a hurry.  I said earlier this year that Ark's year last year was not sustainable and there would be a significant correction/rotation, but I think the magnitude of the correction/rotation is even more than I would have expected.

I do feel badly for the major inflow of people earlier this year who seemed to pour in right at the peak of growth stocks and I think young people in many cases do want to invest in what they're excited about and understandably so. But this year has not been the year for growth themes like green energy and it may continue to be a more difficult year for those sorts of things vs last year's super easy year.

If someone is dismayed/upset by the volatility this year, you have to really create a game plan and gradually adjust to a point where you're more comfortable with your portfolio going forward.",,

Stock futures are down this morning, with tech once again leading the plunge. Nasdaq off 1.2%. S&P 500 down 0.8%. Dow 0.6% lower. That’s as of 0650.

This follows a reversal late in yesterday’s session. Stocks were up until the afternoon. The selling has persisted overnight.

Cryptos are faring even worse than stocks, with bitcoin down below 40k. Investors are dumping bonds as well Ten-year yield up 1% to around 1.66%.

Couple of things driving this. One is a new crackdown by the Chinese central bank, the PBOC, on cryptos. Then there is inflation. Apparently the strong earnings by retailers have fed this fire. (Macy’s even beat estimates. If people are shopping at Macy’s they must be really desperate to get rid of their money). 

Producer prices in the UK are growing at their fastest rate in nine years and as I write this Target just came in and beat earnings (Lowe’s the other major retailer beat on revenues but missed pretty big on earnings).

Does it always work out that way? Of course not otherwise people wouldn't be so high on index funds.  We have no idea what is going to happen going forward, but long standing growth funds are so looked down on from days of 1.1 - 2. 0% fees in the 2000s.  Now we are looking at 0.5 - 0.6% in most. With that I make $2,500 per $1million I manage.  That comes out of the fee.  See 12b-1 fees on any mutual fund.  If that gets squeezed harder it makes it harder for me to earn a living.  If I get squeezed out of the business that is 25-50 people a year that don't get started investing into their retirement annually.  


Additionally, I don't see the issue with earning a commission, I am not just a middle man to the investor and the fund company.  


The biggest variable in investing isn't the fund, it is human behavior.  Managing people's behavior be it starting to invest, increasing monthly contributions, time in the market,  adding additional contributions during bear markets, not selling out of fear, proper positioning of your money tax wise.   These are the things that make or break your retirement, not index vs managed. 


On paper its easy to say this fund is better or this has lower fees, but it doesn't take into account everything that goes into investing.  Sometimes people need a coach or somebody to push them into improving their own financial position.


My little brother is a super investor maxing out 401k, Roth, investing in index, additional in robinhood. 


Started from 0 to over 250k in under 5 years.  He left his job and I found errors, not in the funds, but in tax optimization.  There is nothing wrong with having a checks and balances system. It doesn't take much human error to offset index vs. managed differences if there are any going forward",,

806,,2021-05-19 11:28:12,t3_ng39jw,,investing,"Hey all, I’m doing a series where I breakdown and simplify popular option strategies while trying to be as concise yet comprehensive as possible. For today, we’ll be breaking down the Long Straddle Option Strategy as it has come to my attention that TSLA has been edging closer to a point where this strategy could seem increasingly favourable for those highly uncertain of its directionality. I will be covering the basics of the long straddle strategy and hence this is in NO WAY any form of investment advice to tell you to trade Tesla or to advise you to use any strategy on any underlying whatsoever. 

A long straddle is a directionally unbiased option strategy that involves the purchase of a Call option and a Put option of the same strike price. A long straddle is often set up when a trader speculates that the stock will move in a volatile manner but is uncertain as to which direction the underlying may break out from. Hence a trader would set up a straddle to be able to profit if the underlying breaks out in either direction. However if the stock remains stagnant at expiration, the trader will lose money. [Long straddle trade diagram](https://optionliteracy.com/?page_id=518#longstraddlediagram)

Long straddles are typically set up At The Money(ATM), which means buying a call and put that have the same strike price as where the stock would be trading at open of the trade. Take a look below as to how a long straddle is constructed. Stock EEE is trading at $200 at open of the trade.

* March 16/21 Long 200 put- $5.00
* March 16/21 Long 200 call- $5.00

**Max loss** 

A straddle’s max loss is the price paid for the put + the price paid for the call. This is called the total debit paid. In this example since we paid $5 for the call and $5 for the put, our total debit paid =$10/1000 which represents the maximum amount we can lose from this trade. Max loss is realised if the stock stays right at the strike price of both options at expiration as both options will expire worthless due to the fact that they will carry no intrinsic value being ATM and no extrinsic value left at expiration. 

**Profit** 
 
A trader profits from a long straddle when the stock breakouts of a range that is determined by the total debit they pay. To find this range, add the total debit paid to the call options strike price and subtract the total debit paid to the put options strike price. In this example since the total debit paid =$10, by adding $10 to the 200 call and subtracting $10 from the 200 put, the range that the stock needs to breakout from in-order for a trader to profit is 190-210 at expiration. The further the stock breaks out of this range whether to the upside or to the downside, the greater the profits. To visualise this, take a look at the prices of the options at expiration after the stock had broken out of this range.

**AT EXPIRATION on Feb 16 2021 the stock is trading at 220**

* March 16/21 Long 200 put- $0.00
* March 16/21 Long 200 call- $20.00

The total debit of the straddle is now at $20. This is because as the stock moved to 220, the 200 call had gained $20 of intrinsic value by expiration. Meanwhile, the 200 put is trading for $0 because it has no intrinsic value and no extrinsic value at expiration. Since you bought the call option at $5 and sell it at $20, you make $15. Now Accounting for the put option, since you bought the put option at $5 and is now worthless at expiration, you lose $5. 
 
As you made $15 on the call and lost $5 on the put, your total P/L is = $10/$1000. The greater the stock moves out of the range, the greater the profit.

**Breakeven** 

The 2 breakeven points are at the exact range points of the range. In this example, 190 and 210 are the range points. For example, this is because at 190 at expiration, the 200 put will trade for $10 and the 200 call will trade for $0. As you sell the put for a $5 profit and lose the $5 paid for the long call that expires worthless, you breakeven on the trade.

**Loss (different from max loss)**

At expiration, If the stock trades between the ranges but not at either breakeven points nor the strike prices, (190.01-199.99) &(200.01-209.99), you will lose money on the trade (losses that are smaller than max loss)The further the stock ends up away from the strike price, the lesser the loss.

**Implied Volatility (Vega)**: A rise in Implied Volatility will also be profitable for a Long straddle even if there are no movements in the underlying. This is because this strategy is solely comprised of long options and thus has a positive exposure to vega. 

**Time Decay (Theta)**: The passage of time is inherently a disadvantage for the Long straddle strategy. As this strategy is comprised of solely long options, time decay will be even more rampant than a single leg long option. This is the reason as to why you will need the underlying to move to greater extents so as to offset theta decay

**Exercise and assignment** 

Options are rarely recommended to be be held through expiration. However it is important to understand what happens if they do. Should the underlying trade at the straddles strike price at expiration, both options will expire worthless. If one of the options are ITM and held through expiration, exercise and assignment will take place. Only 1 of the 2 options of this strategy can be ITM at expiration.

That said, the reason why the general recommendation is to stick with index funds is a statistical principle known as *regression to the mean*. Basically, if you flip 10 coins and land 8 heads, that's a pretty crazy result. But if you flip them again, you expect to get 5 heads 5 tails, or the mean. It's the same principle with stocks - a basket of stocks might outperform the overall market for a given time frame, but extend that time frame out and they'll do about as well as the overall market. Except the basket of stocks has an 8-figure salaried ""portfolio manager"" and tons of advertising. Repeated studies have shown that the vast majority of actively managed funds that have done better than the market in one period have eventually ended up doing about the same in the long run. 

So why not invest in one of them? Because the fees are ridiculous and eat into your gains, as compared to the low-cost fees of an index fund. 

So no, we can't guarantee that index funds will continue to make 10% year over year. But because of the randomness of the stock market, they're the best way to invest in it if you're going to invest at all.",,

What's Tether?

USDT is a ""stablecoin"" -- a cryptocurrency whose price is supposed to be pegged to the US dollar -- managed by a company called tether.

Initially tether said they enforced the peg by having each USDT be backed by a USD in a bank account. Then tether ran into all sorts of hilarious hijinks over the years, many of which we only found out because they [were made public in NYAG litigation](https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2021.02.17_-_settlement_agreement_-_execution_version.b-t_signed-c2_oag_signed.pdf), including:

* Having all of tether's money in their lawyer's personal bank account (May 2017)
* Not having any bank account anywhere in the world for 6 monthsto receive money in. Yet still emitting $400m new tethers in that period. Their lawyer's personal account had, at most, $60m at any point. Bitfinex had two institutional deposits in that whole period, neither of whom purchased USDT.
* Failing to complete an audit and settling on an attestation (An audit verifies where money comes from. An attestation is just an accoutnant saying ""there was money in a bank account on that date"") for ""transparency"". The morning of the attestation, tether moved $380m from sister company bitfinex into a bank account the morning of the day of the attestation.
* Losing $900M to their money launderer, and covering those losses by commingling bitfinex customer funds with tether reserve funds (2018)
* Finding the last bank on earth, [Deltec Bank from Bahamas](https://www.deltecbank.com/) willing to do business with them after Wells Fargo and HSBC fired them as clients. Remember HSBC has the kind of risk tolerance leaving them to [willingly deals with drug cartels](https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/hsbc-moved-vast-sums-of-dirty-money-after-paying-record-laundering-fine/). No bank wants tether as a client.

Just read section 2 and 3 of the NYAG settlement. It's a blast. The best recap on the tether saga is by [Amy Castor](https://amycastor.com/2019/01/17/the-curious-case-of-tether-a-complete-timeline-of-events/), but [Patrick McKenzie](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2019/10/28/tether-and-bitfinex/) also has a good write up. Note that Patrick's piece is quaint now -- it was written back in 2019 when tether's balance sheet was $2B. Tether now has over [$58B on their balance sheet](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-18-at-11.28.53-PM-1024x585.png)

As far as we know, there was no point in history at which USDT in circulation were backed 1-to-1 by USD in a bank account. At this point, they stopped even pretending -- each tether in circulation is backed by... [tether's ""reserves"".](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/reserves.gif)

The ""Reserves""

For a long time, tether's ""reserves"" were a mystery. As found in the NYAG investigation, tether likely never had a dollar in a bank account for each USDT, at any point, ever. They're now forced to reveal the makeup in May 2021 as per the NYAG settlement. Tether found a 5-person accounting firm in the Cayman islands willing to do an [attestation](https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/tether-assurance-feb-2021.pdf), which states they have 0.36% more assets than liabilities.

In anticipation for their forced public disclosure, tether recently posted this [glorious pie chart](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/glorious_pie_chart-1024x769.png)

Which [has](https://protos.com/tether-pie-chart-usdt-dollar-pegged-crypto-stablecoin-dollar-value/) [prompted](https://bennettftomlin.com/2021/05/13/for-every-1-of-tether-there-are-0-03-in-cash/) [many](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tether-first-breakdown-shows-token-120000439.html) [more](https://www.ft.com/content/529eb4e6-796a-4e81-8064-5967bbe3b4d9) [questions](https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2021/05/13/tether-publishes-two-pie-charts-of-its-reserves/). First, we can view the actual debt in this form, as [broken Intel Jackal](https://twitter.com/intel_jakal) ([image](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/piechart.png))

Almost all of the reserves are in some form of loan to a commercial company (corporate bonds, commercial paper, secured loans). Only around 5% are in assets whose value we know (cash, T-Bills).

Inconsistencies

Tether's general counsel, Stuart Hoegner, posted a [highly unusual blog post](https://stuarthoegner.medium.com/tether-is-setting-a-new-standard-for-transparency-and-responding-to-criticism-that-is-fc130e08319b) in which he claims this is good debt by any standard. This raises many inconsistencies, which are easy to see given the magnitude of the numbers at hand.

* Stuart claims they don't hold Treasury Bills because the interest rate is close to 0%. If they hold this risky debt as reserves because it pays higher interest, **why does tether only have 0.36% more assets than liabilities?** Either thether's management is looting the interest rates on the assets and leaving USDT holders with the debt's risk, or we're being lied to.
* With $20B in commercial paper at the time of the attestation, and 50% more USDT on the market since, tether presumably has **$30B in commercial paper** at time of writing. The [entire commercial paper market](https://sec.gov/files/primer-money-market-funds-commercial-paper-market.pdf) in the US is around $1T per year.

We're supposed to believe that **tether somehow holds 3% of the US commercial paper market** at time of writing, and that they *apparently bought 1% of the entire market in the last month alone*.

* The asset allocation strategy in the reserves seems to be [copied from](https://twitter.com/intel_jakal/status/1394562510070583296) an investment fund at tether's bank, Deltec. This investment fund apparently manages $425M, rather than $60B.
* If the reserves are such regular financial assets, how come respectable accounting firms won't even touch it for a simple attestation?

We know that some of the money used for USDT come from Chinese money laundering because a tether shareholder [was recently charged](https://protos.com/china-crypto-otc-king-zhao-dong-criminal-charges-court-docs-show/). But we see no mention of frozen accounts in the reserves. Moreover, this amounts to less than $0.5B, and the perpetrator was nicknamed the ""Chinese OTC King"" -- so even in the charitable case where USDT are fully backed by money laundering, this raises inconsistencies.

Reminder: non-USD reserves for a stablecoin are a problem

As noted by [Frances Coppola](https://www.coppolacomment.com/2021/05/tethers-smoke-and-mirrors.html), it's dangerous to guarantee to clients that something is worth $1 when your assets backing it are not dollars. The value of the USD changes very little. The value of crypto changes a lot.

If you want to enforce a market price of $1 for something backed by not-dollars, then the quantity of reserves needs to go up and down with the asset price changes. Otherwise, you'll eventually become insolvent, when asset prices become lower than what you bought them for.

Who are these loan to?

Tether has lost the privilege of the benefit of doubt a long time ago. Here is how tether's Ponzi scheme likely works:

* All their commercial debt is to the related exchanges (Binance, FTX, Bitfinex - see below) or their affiliated shell companies.
* Tether make new USDT out of thin air and send them against a dollar-denominated loan to these affiliates
* The affiliates use the new USDT to put market buy-orders for crypto, putting them on the new USDT on market
* Crypto goes up in value becaue of the new demand pressure. This overcollateralizes the affiliated loans, justifying more loans.
* Rinse, repeat.

We can track who new USDT go to directly by looking at their [TRON](https://tronscan.org/#/address/TKHuVq1oKVruCGLvqVexFs6dawKv6fQgFs/transfers), [ethereum](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5754284f345afc66a98fbb0a0afe71e0f007b949#tokentxns), [OMNI](https://omniexplorer.info/address/1NTMakcgVwQpMdGxRQnFKyb3G1FAJysSfz) and [Solana](https://explorer.solana.com/address/Q6XprfkF8RQQKoQVG33xT88H7wi8Uk1B1CC7YAs69Gi) blockchain addresses. By matching the blockchain addresses new USDT are sent to to known parties, we can track who are the ones sending [new USDT on the market:](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tether-to-exchanges-1024x530.png)

The counterparties are largely Binance, FTX, Bitfinex, and other exchanges. The commercial paper is presumably to affiliated shell companies. I wouldn't put those companies debt at a dollar-to-dollar valuation; for instance [Binance is currently under investigation by the DOJ and IRS](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-13/binance-probed-by-u-s-as-money-laundering-tax-sleuths-bore-in).

But how does the $1 peg hold?

This is an easy one. [FTX happily admits to enforcing the dollar peg](https://twitter.com/AlamedaTrabucco/status/1348773044873949185) ([image](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-18-at-11.12.17-PM-861x1024.png))

You can easily enforce the dollar peg by wash-trading around the $1 price and arbitraging on exchanges who don't.

FTX don't even need to be complicit to the scheme for this to make financial sense: if FTX can get new USDT for $1 on an infinite loan margin from tether, it's perfectly sensible to buy USDT when it's below $1 and shortsell USDT when it's above.

The Mississippi bubble, 2021 style

The cryptocurrency ecosystem is conceptually simple. Money comes in from new investors buying, and the same money comes out to pay those cashing out. It would be a zero-sum ecosystem, except for the fact that miners have to pay their [bills in dollars](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/crypto_is_simple.png)

This is why ""bitcoin investors"" feel an immediate urge to tell everyone else to invest in bitcoin -- if no new money comes in, the financial structure eventually collapses under the miner's sell pressure.

Note how this is different than buying a company's stock. People buy and sell stocks on a stock exchange, but the companies independently have money coming in (from their clients). The stock of a profitable company is a positive-sum ecosystem. If somehow no one wants to buy the stock, a profitable company will be happy to buy it back itself.

When tether comes in with their scheme, they put demand pressure on BTC then add a supply constraint on BTC (also driving up the price!) by reducing the total supply of BTC to [hoard in their reserves](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/crypto_is_usdt.png)

Notice that even though bitcoin prices are higher, **no additional money entered the ecosystem** in the tether pump. Like a Ponzi scheme, we *cannot pay everyone off at the inflated price* using the pool of money that's in the crypto ecosystem (More specifically, the pool of money in the crypto exchange's customer fund bank accounts) When enough money starts looking for the exit door, a $60B hole gets torn into the ecosystem, and [someone has to pay for it.](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/masterpiece.gif)

The danger zone happens when BTC drops below $18,500

Assuming that each new USDT is used to instantly buy BTC at market prices (This is a lower bound estimate, since USDT are issued on the market between mint periods, where price is increasing), we can track where the BTC ""price of no return"" is -- where reserve BTC were paid for [more overall than they're now worth.](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tether_insolvency_point.png)

We can play around with parameters (they might buy ETH or Dogecoin rather than BTC, etc.) but most calculations land the death zone in the $17k-$20k range -- prices we were at around December 2020.

The scheme can easily collapse above this point. Bernie Madoff's customer deposits was around $18B against a $65B promised liabilities, but his scheme collapsed way before $40B in funds were withdrawn, because fraudsters tend to mismanage and embezzle some of the money for themselves.

Notice that the last point in time where BTC price went significantly below the death zone is the March 2020 COVID price crash -- which is also the point where USDT were started to be minted at a parabolic rate.

The DeFi boom started with the USDT flood

This is a sidenote to this story, but the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) boom started because of USDT flooding the market. DeFi is not a new invention: it's existed since the 2017 bubble. No one picked it up because it's a fairly useless idea: lock up more collateral for a crypto loan than the loan's value and use the loan.

DeFi is exclusively used to leverage trading - eg. lock up BTC, keep the BTC exposure, and use the loan to buy more BTC. You can't buy a house or start a business on a DeFi loan -- the point of normal loans is to use personal creditworthiness and **under**collateralization to move future cashflows into the present. For these reasons, [no one picked it up for years](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-18-at-11.16.05-PM-1024x497.png)

But notice something happened around the same time as USDT exploded. We can track what happened to DeFi by getting historical borrowing rates and matching them to total money in DeFi (TVL), USDT in [DeFi and total USDT](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/defirates-1024x512.png)

A clear story emerges:

No one used DeFi until tether joined the Ethereum blockchain in April 2019. Then a ton of new tethers, with no particular place to go, found themselves emitting DeFi loans. This floored the borrowing rates for DeFi, especially so in April 2020, after tether started printing themselves out of insolvency.

Once borrowing rates were appealing, DeFi started taking off.

Eventually, the DeFi ecosystem tried to distance itself from USDT, but the coin is still around 45% of the entire space.

USDT DeFi loans are generally USDT-denominated. If the USDT peg breaks significantly, these USDT DeFi loans will go into margin call one way or another.

The noose is tightening

At the time of writing, BTC crashed from a high of $64k to around $41k (now 38k). But more importantly, for the first time in months, we're starting to see **significant backflows** into tether addresses, largely from Binance. Here are the outflows and inflows (excluding newly minted USDT) into the tether address [on Tron, for example](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/death-1024x567.png)

The orange lines are USDT coming out onto market. The blue lines are USDT coming back into tether's blockchain address.

This is means people are recently withdrawing, a lot. The music could stop at any moment now. It could take hours, or it could take months.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Not from the copy paste: I want to add to this, on the day of Elon's initial tweet about Tesla not accepting bitcoin, there was a drastic spike of bitcoin coming into exchanges JUST PRIOR to the tweet. Was this Elon, someone he told, or just a lucky trade? Who knows. However, after the tweet there was a sudden move of 650 million tether (so $650m)  onto exchanges to BUY bitcoin as the price was collapsing and this stabilized the price. In my opinion tether is being used to inflate BTC but unlike the federal reserve tether cannot print $$$$. **Oh, and tether clearly states they do NOT guarantee any redemption of dollars to holders of tether.** IE they are not assured you can trade a tether for a dollar like other stable coins

&#x200B;

I would recommend avoiding BTC until tether is fully audited and we know what companies that commercial paper is from.",ng3im3,The truth about tether and crypto prices

>When stocks crash, people move temporarily to bonds. That’s a no brainer.

What you are saying here really is that bond prices have an inverse correlation to equity prices, so when equity prices fall, people sell equities and buy bonds for the safe haven, rallying prices, and forcing yields lower.  This is somewhat true, but in reality, its complex that then, i plotted a rolling 1Y correlation between 10s and SPX.  In times of distress (2007-2009) there is a strong negative correl like youd expect (peaking at -80%). however in 2010, there was a strong positive r\^2 of almost 60% (meaning people were buying both stocks and bonds). if you were to plot the running 1Y correl overtime, you will see its actually quite cyclical, isolating between +60% and -60% on a somewhat regular basis.  sometimes people are buying both stocks and bonds (forcing yields lower) and sometimes people are selling equities and selling bonds.  Its not a no brainer by any stretch, as recently as last year, 10y/spxt had a positive 1y r\^2 of 54%

>you also see bonds crashing since then because the Fed crashed interest rates to nothing.

the fed doesnt ""crash"" interest rates, and only controls the most short term 3month rate (and the interest on excess reserves (IOER rate) it lows the rates in an orderly way at the FMOC meetings.  Also incorrect is that when the fed lowers rates that means prices \*rise\* not fall, so there is no crash, but also its incorrect that the entire curve of maturities 2y, 5y, 10y, 20y, 30y falls in the exact same manner as the way the fed moves the short dated rate.  if the fed lowers the fed funds rate by 25bps, that doesnt mean the 10y yield falls by 25bps.  the long end of the curve trades much more on future inflation expectations, and not short term economic trends.

>Stretch it back to 2009 and up see the exact same thing, bonds didn’t recover until interest rates floated up after years, 2014/2015.

I'm not sure which ""bonds"" you're referring to here, but if you look at 10y returns from 2009-2020 you will find that 10y rallied almost every year:

&#x200B;

|2010|\+10.08%||
|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|\+15.46%||
|2012|\+3.92%||
|2013|\-4.42%||
|2014|\+6.46%||
|2015|\+1.26%||
|2016|\+0.45%||
|2017|\+0.89%||
|2018|\-0.73%||
|2019|\+4.12%||
|2020|\+8.30%||

so 10Y notes have had an awesome bull run, despite fed fund rate being more or less pinned to the 25bps lower zero bond.

&#x200B;

hope that helps fix some of your misconceptions!",,

If you think that 15 years from now the US will be a failed state like Venezuela, then don't buy the S&P500, just keep in mind for you to be right, long term, it probably means China becoming the dominant superpower in the world and US intellectual property being a distance second, our military losing dominance, and 99.9% of Americans having a greatly diminished standard of living.",,

This is based ONLY on my ETF's so I will hopefully have a lot of wiggle room to get to this point and stay there or grow before accounting for my stocks, crypto, and 401k.

I used investor.gov compound interest calculator. Assuming I put $27,000 in with monthly contributions of $1500 (should be possible) at an interest rate of 7-9% for 27-32 years, at 50-55 years old I will have ~$2,125,000.

Most of world is still garbage. Including China

One way to go around this, is invest in competitive industries abroad, where Americans lost edge. 

For example semiconductors in Taiwan and Korea. They profit from China growth, yet is a industry which Chinese will not control in next decade or two. However I wouldn't be comfortable buying whole market index there. Anyway both governments (Korean and Taiwanese) heavily subsidies semiconductors. So bet on whole semiconductor industry, is actually bet on their government too. Their currencies, especially TWD is super stable (look Taiwan forex reserve). 

When bet on Japan, i would go for dividend stock index in Japan. Many great, big stable companies with 4 % dividend

And I would consider betting on index in India, cause whole market will raise up crazy in next 30 year.

I still work up my portfolio but roughly idea is:
 
- 50% american stocks (market ETF) 
- 15% Taiwanese and Korean semiconductors (ETD for semiconductor) 
- 15 % India (market ETF) 
- 10 % EU (Just 2 companies Airbus, Volkswagen. Again bet on them is betting on EU) 
10 % Japan (either dividend index or I would pick 5 dividend stocks) 

So I am covered for currencies risk, plus betting on India. As well having mix of ETF and few stocks i personally pick up. And in Japan I cover dividend stocks",,

Answering these questions will help to set you up for eventual success and develop your individual asset allocation strategy accordingly.

Let’s get to the facts: actively trading stocks, and timing market entries and exits come with inherent risks. Missing the best 10 days in the market between 2010 and 2020 would mean an overall decline of 33% (see [*Bank of America chart*](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/this-chart-shows-why-investors-should-never-try-to-time-the-stock-market.html) below). Moreover, it is unlikely you sell your assets right before a crash and buy back at the bottom. In most cases, the worst days are followed by the best days which would put you back on square one holding your cash waiting for the crash.

### Strategies to Pick Stocks

Although stock-picking follows a more active approach, long-term investing means being active 1% of the time while leaving your portfolio alone for the other 99%. It is important to keep in mind that less than 10% of all public companies drive 100% of long-term stock-market returns. Therefore your mission is to find the 10% and patiently ride the wave.

Some hands-on advice:

* **Limited diversification**, as you cannot continuously research each company you are invested in on a regular basis. The range of 10-15 stocks is healthy, otherwise, go back to the previous section and consider passive investing.
* **Flexible & innovative companies** can adapt their business model and expand their market potential. The companies with today’s highest market caps all have this trait in common.
* **Don’t ignore what is familiar**, in 1966 Walt Disney was valued at $80 million and they just produced Mary Poppins turning over $30 million alone on that movie. The company was well-known and anyone could have picked up a few shares. $1000 invested back then would average you over $4 million today.
* **Know your strengths** and profit from them. If you are mathematically gifted then focus on the fundamentals. If you work in the industry and know the competitive landscape and product lineup, do that. Find your own style of investing.
* **Google is your friend**, look up the approval rate of the CEO on Glassdoor, read job reviews, check the company’s premises on Google street view and go on the investor relations site of the company. You need to do your own due diligence because nobody physically audits the business you invest in.
* **Leadership and the CEO** are decisive for the long-term success of a company. If the leader of a company is also its founder and owns lots of stock in it, the interests are aligned with the other shareholders and hence money is invested more efficiently.
* **Human** **resource management** such as low employee turnover, revenue per employee, diversity, inclusion, and so forth.
* **Deep dive into the company**: How does it create revenue? What is its market potential? Market growth versus the overall market potential of S&P500? What are the competitive advantages? Cashflow structure? Insider selling? Check on earnings calls, shareholder letters, and sweat the fundamentals a little bit.
* **Impact**: Does this company contribute to a better future?
* **Don’t overpay** because even great companies can be too expensive when too much of their future earnings potential is already priced in. Microsoft’s revenue was 3x higher in 2009 than in 1999 and still, the stock had lost 50% of its value in that timeframe.
* **Avoid** owning a stock you can’t explain or you lack conviction in.
* **Double down** on companies that you are convinced are great investments for the long run even if you already own shares. If the business proves viable and returns are increasing, then it is likely to follow that trajectory in the near future.
* **Hold & wait**: trade as little as possible to avoid taxes and to enjoy the runups. The shorter you hold an asset the greater the chance that you have to close the position at a loss. The magic of compound interest will do the rest for you.
* **“Don’t lose money”** – Warren Buffett & treat every dollar as an investment.

I believe that beating the market is possible if you are patient and willing to invest time. After all, the business world is like a car race. In the last quarter of the race, it becomes more evident who might win, and your odds can be calculated with minimized risk exposure. Then you invest in the top-performing racers and still reap much of the benefits.

Keep in mind that most stocks underperform the market. The outsized gains of a few winners are pushing your portfolio higher and make up for any losses on the way.

## Cash

Oh, sweet cash sitting ducks in my account, what am I going to do with you? At current rates of around 1% (if even) it would take 70 years to double my money. By that time it is more likely that I am buried 6 feet underground. I wouldn't even get to experience my slim gains.

Yet there is some upside to holding a percentage of your overall portfolio in cash. Besides, you can’t pay your expenses off by handing out your stocks. Holding some cash is in both active and passive investing approaches detrimental. I advise holding approximately 5-15% of cash as it allows you to:

* Leave your portfolio in peace
* Remain calm during market volatility
* Jump in when prices are low and be opportunistic in the markets

Buying stocks in times of recession has historically brought about outsized gains for investors. It is worth remembering, the more it hurts holding some cash in market booms the more likely you will profit from a swift down-market. The best time to hold cash is when it really hurts to do so. Holding cash allows you to be prepared, and you don’t have to worry about timing the market.
