**DD and back story -**

**The Good**

We'll get to that part in a bit

**The bad**

The history: GE was a massive company, has been around forever and was known as one of the quintessential American companies. They became this massive conglomerate that bought up companies left and right leading up to the mortgage backed securities bonanza in the mid 2000's. Not sure I'll need to remind everyone what happened at the end of that (Rhymed with Semen Mothers) but GE took it particularly bad. See after the 2008 / 2009 meltdown it turned out that not only had they lost a ton of money on derivatives and other financial products but (as would become public later) they lied to investors about it on disclosures and jumped through hoops to keep investors from finding out just how bad the situation was. Add to that some really badly timed all cash acquisitions that worked out terribly and the company was about ready to go belly up.

**The Ugly**

There is a reason that while the whole world got its act back together after 2009, GE continued to play act a paraplegic thrown in the deep end of a pool. The stock took beating after beating as news kept coming out about acquisitions that went bad (massive write downs), accounting fraud and various other losses. After getting rid of their CEO they brought in someone else to try and turn things around, then after a very short run they replaced that guy with the current CEO Larry Culp. They basically had to bribe / beg him to take the job, getting him to leave a cushy gig at Harvard where he was basically in working retirement after having earned a reputation as a corporate turn around guru.

**Making our way back to the good**

While GE's stock continued to flounder Culp got busy and started to shake things up. First he started selling divisions and companies. Some of them had been with GE forever, like the lightbulb divisions, others were acquisitions (some of which only a few years old) that were sold off. This wasn't about profiting by spinning something off - it was about cutting losses and making sense out of a massive company that didn't have a functioning balance sheet. Some of the chunks that were sold were profitable and many were not. The net effect was that he cut operating expenses more than he cut operating revenue, moving free cash flow (FCF) in the right direction (albeit still negative at this point) and raising cash from the sales.

They slashed the dividend to 1 penny. People were clutching their pearls and screaming! I mean... It was GE for Pete's sake. They've had a good dividend forEVER! This dragged the stock down more. But it shoved FCF in the right direction.

Between significantly improved FCF and money raised from selling off divisions and assets GE managed to cut its TOTAL debt from $130 BILLION to $71 BILLION (which is about where it is right now, although they do have more than $25 billion cash on hand). Oh yeah they also own 25% of Baker Hughes (valued at about $6.5 billion, that is after they sold $1 billion worth of it recently), they are also selling GECAS (airline leasing company that owned airliners and rented them out to airlines and other companies) to the global leader in the space. In return for shedding this division, which due to structural issues and insufficient scale to create real efficiencies, was losing GE $700 million a year in FCF, GE is getting $24 billion in cash, $1 billion in cash equivalents and $6 billion worth of a company (45% of the company's stock) that happens to be beaten up at the moment but is the world's largest airline leasing company and is about to have a gang buster year as airlines struggle to find planes. Could easily see the value of that swelling and then them dumping it to pay down even more debt.

**The Good - you may have to squint but it is there. I swear**

GE is now a rather lean company, especially compared to the mess that existed 5 years ago. I've given you the current cash / debt position. From that alone, doesn't seem great but I do ask that you keep in mind the trend line, from $130BB to $71BB over 5 years.

Today GE is made up of 4 divisions (they no longer make home appliances, it isn't one of the divisions. yes I know, they still are on the market but the stuff sold under the GE name in home appliances is by actually made by the Haier conglomerate and.... never mind):

**HealthCare** \- Not sure if any of you have had an MRI but if you had you may have had the same weird experience I did. Walking into the room, kind of nervous to get this big medical test to find out what is wrong with my ::Insert body party here:: and being confronted with the biggest GE logo I have EVER seen. Embossed into the side of this MRI machine. Anyway, whether you were aware of it or not GE makes a lot of tech for healthcare. from MRI machines to ultrasounds and tons of other stuff. It is a growing business that is consistently profitable and ***something*** *:: cough cough COVID knocked us on our butt and hospitals need to retool and get better::* tells me that healthcare spending is going to be rising a lot this year and next year.

**Energy -** Basically this is about steam turbines used for 20th century electricity generation (and storage in some cases). Talking huge turbines used in natural gas, oil, coal, nuclear and geothermal power plants (I think GE itself may consider Hydro power plant turbines part of this sector but I'm listing them below because that makes more sense). While not very forward looking this business has the potential to generate significant FCF over the next few years maybe even a decade or more. While some of these power sources are on their way out others (like natural gas) have seen a surge in utilization and some (nuclear) seem to be about to make a comeback. This chunk of GE is usually profitable, although not hugely so. That being said, between what happened in Texas which will require several power plants to be overhauled or replaced, existing service and new equipment contracts and the potential to grow, I think this is a worthwhile business unit to keep around.

**Renewable Energy -** Some solar, a decent amount of hydro power, a growing pumped storage segment and WIND TURBINES. These electrical generators (and in the case of pumped storage - mechanical batteries) are one of the most exciting areas for me personally when looking at the GE story. GE briefly snagged the title as producing the world's largest wind turbine (14 MW) and it is the largest one that many countries have certified for use. This thing is bonkers, every rotation of the blades produces enough electricity to power roughly 4,000 homes for a DAY. It is a monster and it has been selected for use in the next phase of the world's largest offshore wind farm and the first phase of the US' first large offshore windfarm. GE also makes onshore wind turbines, they make the truly massive turbines used in huge hydro electric damns and they also make turbines for use in pumped storage\*. This segment has up till now been generation negative FCF (losing money) however it is growing by leaps and bounds and seems poised to start adding to positive FCF a little this year or next and then growing exponentially.

\*Pumped storage is really cool. Basically you create a large body of water (like a lake) by using excess electricity made by solar and wind when it is available to pump water up hill. Then, when you need more electricity because it is night time or the wind isn't blowing you throw the turbine in reverse and it acts as a hydro electric damn.

**Aviation** \- This is the crown jewel of GE although in a weird twist of fait it delivered a kick to the nuts just as things started turning around. Needless to go into much detail as to why a business that makes its money building and servicing jet engines might be negatively effected when air travel takes a year and a half pause. That being said GE's newest engines are showing a great track record of winning orders. Doing this DD I found out that apparently when you buy commercial airliners you get to pick what engines you want (if there are more than one option) kind of like when you buy a car and pick whether you want the in dash CD player or not. GE's engines are proving to be more efficient, more reliable and cheaper to operate than their main competitor Pratt and Whitney. That means that as everyone gets waxed and vaxed in preparation for the horney party boom we are about to witness airlines have started ordering planes again and in a big way. You see, during the covid crisis airlines didn't have many customers and what most of them did was they identified their oldest and/or most problematic aircraft and sold them off various other companies in other industries or to companies that lease aircraft to airlines when they need a few to fill a gap. Now that things are coming back online airlines are ordering more planes. As other parts of the world start to open up over time this should create sustained tail winds for this division.

Oh yeah and one thing that often seems to be overlooked is that while yes, the aviation division has been beat up, management has used this as an opportunity to streamline and improve operations. Both sales and maintenance saw significant drops in revenue however the drop in FCF was smaller than would be expected because the whole time GE was improving its margins. Now as their order book starts filling up the aviation division is significantly leaner and more optimized which should mean that when the FCF starts up again this fall or this winter it should turn into a firehose.

**Other points of interest**

GE has announced a 1 for 8 stock split (that is a reverse split, for every 8 shares you own you will end up with 1 share that is worth 8X the pre split value). This makes sense for a few reasons.

1. GE has a massive number of shares outstanding and doing this reverse split will bring its stock price (adjusted for market cap) within line with its piers and should put it in a position to re-enter the DOW. Doing so will create demand for the shares as it is added to funds that track that index.
2. Once GE reinstates its dividend (which will be another catalyst for the stock to continue upwards) the lower share count means a slower drain on FCF since I imagine they will incrementally increase the dividend. It seems silly because it doesn't really matter how many shares except when you consider that they have so many that if you decide to go from a dividend of $0.01 to $0.10 the difference in share float would be hundreds of millions annualized in FCF. Obviously the target yield wouldn't be impacted but even this small thing can have a real impact in speeding up the debt reduction.
3. I fully expect that as the stock price increases and then the reverse split happens GE will do a share issuance to raise a few billion to pay down the debt. I view that as a buying opportunity as any drop in share price should be short lived and I expect the resulting reduction in debt will mean net / net share prices will increase due to the issuance.

On that note GE has committed to a stated target of 2.5 times EBITDA (which is the cutoff for investment grade securities) from the current 6 times EBITDA. Getting to investment grade will create increased upside pressure, that is why I'm saying the stock will go up when they issue more shares (even though there will likely be a temporary dip at that time).",nmkhyz,GE - a bull Thesis (F off haters - Imma go 🚀🚀🚀🚀 to the MOON)

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote...

and balking at even a penny of additional liquidity. How the Fed will continue to monetize debt then, when the repo system is now out of collateral, is anyone's guess.

By mid-July, we’ll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase higher yields in the FX swap market amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative

Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks.

Consider this also . Annual mining output is roughly 800-1000 million ounces of silver a year. They use around those numbers as well 900M a year. It's a very tight market. 330 million americans. Say 10% of americans buy 100oz physical. 28usd x 100 = 2800USD quite affordable.. 10% of 330 million = 33 million 33 million x 100oz  330 million ounces off the market. That is a big supply shortage not counting in the domino effect.........


Silver rose 35 x in the 1970s,Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. When inflation hit 3.5 silver hit 50 in 2011 . Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms.

As a ticket here I prefer PSLV, but all ETFs essentially share the same traits in that you can invest extremely large sums of money with them and it is highly liquid to get in and out of. Only the whale investors can actually take physical out, but if they are taking it out, it’s not to bring home 1,000 oz bars to use as doorstops, but probably to transfer to a vault of their choosing. These will generally move with the price of the underlying metal. Some of these ETFs  like slv  you can buy call options with, which can provide you some upside leverage. However, the idea here is to park large sums of money through your brokerage with them to realize gains over a long term. The one major downside most of these have is you are giving your money to the trust, and the trust owns the metal not you and mostly those trusts are not favored to metal price spike .",nmkmcq,"Rrp explosion , inflation spike and results for precious metal"

so a bit of a preface, i'm pretty new to investing, but one thing i do know is science, so hear me out.

Tesla is known as a good long term investment because of the fact that eventually we are all going to need electric cars in hope to reduce our carbon emissions as low as possible, meaning the abandonment of the internal combustion engine... or does it? recently in the past few years there have been a lot of study's released proving that synthetic fuel or fuel basically made of of hydrogen with renewable energy like wind power is actually as carbon neutral as electric engines, i think this is dooming to tesla for a few reasons.

1. synthetic fuel is MUCH more convenient then electric. synthetic fuel is able to work in the internal combustion engine which means that people wouldn't have to replace their cars. the base model of the cheapest tesla is 35,000 dollars USD which a lot of family's(including mine) can't afford to spend on a new car, especially if our current one is working. so that's thousands of cars being left in the dust while they can be used and have a neutral carbon footprint.
2. tesla problems. from what i have heard tesla's are built like sh#t, low quality and poor assembly make them prone to needing repairs, which normal car mechanics are not equipped or trained to deal with because of the obvious. also tesla's are extremely heavy, i don't really care about that but apparently that's a huge turn off for others.
3. other industry's. so tesla and other electric car company's make electric cars, not planes or boats, so that means that those to major contributors are left out to still release a lot of co2. with synthetic fuel they can switch alongside cars making it better in that sense.
4. car fans. so i know a lot of car enthusiasts who, all hate tesla's and wouldn't buy one if they had to. they would much rather stick to their cars like Lamborghini's and other old cars that would get left out with electric cars but would still be as usable synthetic, and considering the amount of car enthusiasts in the world and how much they affect the auto market i don't see it panning out there.
5. timing. so no matter what number you agree on for how long it's going to take to switch completely electric it's stupid. so like i said earlier the majority of family's can't just drop thirty five k on a new car meaning it would take awhile to be able to get everyone electric plus the time and money it would take to build up the infrastructure to switch electric but considering that synthetic fuel uses the same stuff as petrol it would be much easier to keep going synthetic.
6. back on the subject of time, i saw a study saying we could switch completely synthetic by 2024 if we tried. whomever if you look at electric you see company's like GM saying they will have 50 new electric MODELS by 2050, do we really have that time? science say's no.

so if you take these reasons ( and they are not all, i have a few more ) into consideration tesla now might be a good stock with nice returns but now that synthetics are becoming more and more possible i am starting to think they might actually be our future. like i said I'm pretty new and relatively dumb on the mentality of other investors please leave your opinion below.",nml65m,Tesla might be a bad future investment.

See you at the top boys.

Palantir will MOON soon. Get on board before we take off.

1. The company itself, Palantir; one of the only 2 **unicorn** startups to emerge from the defense sector, focused on national security, alongside SpaceX.

A real company that has built its product for **18 years**, & **PROVEN** its products on national level (UK Vaccination), US ARMY , NAVY and soon AIRFORCE, (BP) OIL&GAS Sector, Law Agency, Mining sector (rio tinto), IBM cloud, etc.

2) There were news of Palantir's Enterprise Resource Planning system with Amazon's cloud service platform Amazon Web Services, making it available to all AWS customers. AND PROVEN to be so value-adding, BP used it and saved 50 million in working capital within 2 weeks of installation, with the potential to do more if applied across their worldwide supply chain. The ERP suite can be deployed within days for all AWS customer. This is HUGE , and DOWNPLAYED last friday because of all the market shits that have been going on.

3) I would also say a lot other recent PLTR news have been downplayed, and PLTR always doesn't make a huge marketing about their announcements, like Karp has said, they believe in the long term, the value of PLTR would reveal itself.

4) The insider selloff has made the company undervalued. Remember when insiders were selling their 20% shares in direct listing at $7.50? How undervalued they were before people including Cathie Wood/ArkInvest started to realize and it rose to $27 within a month? You can take advantage of the insiders' selloffs of their long term held shares, infact, i think they are done (a lot were sold initially, but no selloff for last week) and we are going to the fking moon.

5) All the paperhands' shares and insiders' shares are going to diamond hands like Cathie Wood, who are going to hold for years. I see Cathie Wood buying PLTR like TSLA, don't forget Cathie Wood bought TSLA in 2018 (that's some insane gains), and she is the god among all fund managers when it comes to spotting a disruptive/growth stock, she literally does this for a living and got famed as the best investor now at the age of 65.

6) Cathie Wood just keep buying PLTR with 2 ARK funds, owns over 1% of Palantir, and she's not done yet. She bought at $30, $25, every $23.You are literally getting an insurance that Cathie wood would save your ass IF the stock goes under.

7) It's literally inevitable for PLTR to get more contracts and increase its revenue and growth... also not forgetting the stickiness of the contracts and business, it's hard to forgo the product after u have integrated it into your business.

8) In this Era of Big Data, PLTR is literally the leader in the dominating industry of the near future, which company/service is not going to use the best Data Analytics software in the future or even now?

9) Proven Track Record of HUGE Growth and credibility , proven 42% revenue growth YoY, expected 45% for next quarter, AT LEAST 30% for next 5 years, words of Karp. Last Year, Karp said at least 30% for YoY and he did 42% YoY like a boss.

10) Don't forget we got a $34 Price Target from Goldman Sachs after the earnings

11) If investors are justifying growth stocks' value with growth, I see Palantir time and time proven overperformed growth rate as the most bullish factor. Also, its cost is going to drive down because the main costs are from employee stock options now, which will expire in the future. And the accumulation of sticky contracts, it's also easier to maintain/update software installation than installing the software initially in new companies. It also has a huge monopoly in the fast growing industry. (added point from replying a comment)

12) It's ok that the some retards don't join us now, because they will eventually join us in the future, they always join after the rocket is halfway to the moon, they always do. And when that happens, we will still welcome them.",nmlb2d,Palantir Options - DIRT CHEAP

I still think they are going to have a huge share buyback of over 14m shares (their buyback program was increased from 75m to 475m) in stock and add to the insider owned shares which is now at 54.80% over the week it has gone up about 2%. Which is a bullish signal. If 14m shares were bought that would leave about 51m shares to be traded publicly and the insider owned share percentage would go to about 62% which would be a large driving factor in the price going up due to scarcity. Also the buyback would be large enough to trigger a massive buy and I would jizz my pants.",nmnbfw,*UPDATE* Why I still Think EXPI Is Going To $60 In 4-6 Weeks (up 10.59% this week)

[When we last left our hero,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrly28/the_legend_of_utheemperorofjenks_aka_ornamental/) he had just lost all of his rent money and what he could advance from credit cards on a failed Super Bowl bet, and a YOLO on “Rhodium” that he ordered from a sketchy Slovakian Wish.com ripoff. Alas, it was, of course, fake, and he was broke and depressed. It might have been the first fatal case of autism. He thought to himself “Am I really that retarded?” Then, he realized “No, it must be Oklahoma that’s retarded!”

So, [after a brief case of violent diarrhea from Oklahoma Grocery Store sushi](https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/lrslbb/psa_do_not_eat_grocery_store_sushi_right_now/), he was ready to hatch his plan! Uruguay! Yes, Uruguay. [He was going to move to Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lh5igx/c%C3%B3mo_se_puede_llegar_a_melo_desde_montevideo_sin/)

His plans for this move could’ve been anyone’s guess. One possibility he inquired about was [how to be a Tea Blendmaster.](https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/lfga0m/how_does_one_become_a_blendmaster/) [Another was him possibly reconnecting with God.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/lsij6j/agnostic_jew_seeking_faith_in_god/) Yet, he seemed to be asking questions about another topic more often than the others...

[Bees.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lxcnt1/c%C3%B3mo_es_la_legalidad_de_la_apicultura_informal/)

Specifically, beekeeping, a topic he admitted he had no experience in, [as evident from him looking for any book on the subject as an introduction months before.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/)

What he planned on doing with the bees was anyone’s guess, and I doubt he thought it through that much either. One post **AFTER** he took possession of 200,000 bees (we’ll get to that later,) was [asking Americans if there was a demand for mead in the states.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/) So, was he thinking of importing Uruguayan honey to the US to be made into mead? Was he going to make it himself? Did he move to another continent for no reason? Let’s all find out!

A little more than 2 months ago, he finally did it. [He moved to Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/m9ejpn/la_paloma/) And about a week after that, [he was driving a truck filled with 200k bees across his new country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/) Based on replies in that thread, he was aiming to have [a monopoly on beekeeping in the country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/gt48gke/) 

And for a while, things were kind ok for our young Autist. [He picked up his hives without complication.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mtkkf3/about_to_upsize_my_apiary_whats_the_best_layout/) [And then he settled into Melo, Uruguay, and set up his apiary ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/n1jnte/my_humble_apiary_near_melo_uruguay/). Life was good.

But, trouble was afoot. According to a reply, [the species he was planning on keeping had literally never been kept by keepers in Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mtkkf3/about_to_upsize_my_apiary_whats_the_best_layout/gv0viej/) And then, disaster struck. [He went to TIFU to post his tale of spreading an invasive species in an industry he knew nothing about.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/nmd69k/tifu_by_importing_bees_to_uruguay/)

Indeed, he had no idea even what a bee was until he stumbled his way through a book, and then decided to YOLO into honey in Uruguay. He somehow got in touch with an ecology professor in Montevideo that would help him set things up in exchange for grad students fucking with them every now and again. Oh, and the bees were from fucking Myanmar. Handshake agreement, of course. Total Chad move.

And like I said before, the rest went without incident for a while. It would take the bees “a year” to make honey, so he just kinda hung out, stayed busy, and tried to find part time work in a foreign country he arrived in 2.5 months earlier.

And then, the professor ghosted him. Just disappeared. Shortly thereafter, government agents come out about this kid from Oklahoma illegally importing a non-native bee to their country. Apparently his bees had been fucking with other apiaries. So, he did probably the smartest thing he’s ever done.

He ran.

He fucking ran from the Uruguayan government, took a plane to LAX, and arrived with $14 to his name. His friend sent him $100, which wasn’t enough to go back to Oklahoma, so he took a $75 flight to Seattle, where he is also not from.

His last post is from a train out of the airport, with $39 to his name. I don’t know what is in store for him, but I know that $39 is as good as spent on urchin futures or whatever market he’s going to crash up there.

183,,2021-05-28 03:12:37,t3_nmofz4,,wallstreetbets,"This started as a comment reply but I thought maybe people would like reading it. I've been researching Palantir since literally late November 2020 and I have nearly my entire portfolio in LEAPS expiring January 2023. So I have continually done more research on them this is just the basics to clear up confusion and help people who don't understand it because it's hard to hear all the hype and stuff. Also AMC to the moon tomorrow for my FDs I bought!! Don't judge me it's just fun to be in on the action on weeks like this.


So you should think of palantir as basically three companies and they actually are very far from unprofitable. 

They developed the really massive government software (gotham) specifically as a result of an interaction that happened to Peter Thiel while he was at paypal. They were losing millions to foreign scammers at paypal and the solution ended up being a high quality algorithm that flagged the most likely scam transactions and then allowed analysts to efficiently double check and verify the real scam transactions.

 It essentially was using what computers are efficient at (sorting through massive amounts of data) and then combining that with what humans are good at (looking at the more complex nuances that at least at that point computer algorithms were incapable of doing) and augmenting the humans ability to make complex decisions by rapidly sorting through the incoming data and bringing everything good to their attention.

They fixed paypals using this method and literally made the company profitable overnight because of fixing how much they were losing in the scam transactions. The FBI contacted PayPal and Thiel about using that initial software. That was literally his inspiration for what would become Palantir. He goes over it in huge detail in his book zero to one. If you make an audible account you can read it for free and find the chapter I'm talking about.

Then for 15 years they perfected the government software into the absolute nearly monopoly it is now in government intelligence augmentation software. The whole time though they reinvested almost everything for the last 10 years into building the commercial software (Foundry). That side of the business has only been live for a VERY short time and initially they literally didn't spend a single dollar on marketing their first commercial clients sought THEM out because of their insane reputation with the government. Foundry helps with supply chains and all kinds of other important data  insights. But if you want a recent example the NIH and the NHS both used Foundry to figure out how to best distribute the vaccine and vaccine distribution in the US and Britain has far outpaced expectations. You think commercial companies aren't going to be interested in using the software that was literally proven on a level like that?

 They're only just now adding huge amounts of people to their sales teams literally in the last six months which if you read Peter thiels book is insane for the stock because they have this crazy long term plan and he literally talks about how when they get to a certain point and start adding sales as a full sector of the company it means that is the company the company plans to BEGIN scaling. Meaning they're this big and they literally only just started on the scaling part. Which they've also said in tons of interviews if you're a die hard Palantirian like me. 



They actually also have the third side of the  business which is their actual like full AI for weaponization and war and defense for the government. Gotham is like helping analysts and commanders lead and even helping police or agents figure out what's going on. This other software is different. It's called Apollo and its only at the beginning too. It's like pure AI machine learning AI handles everything stuff. Go find a video called pentagon head of NSC briefs public on AI I think it's on the PBS channel on YouTube or some shit. Or you can listen to Joe Biden talk about how we're going to double our percentage of gdp spending on AI. The amount of government money that's going to go into AI as a weapon to compete with China DWARFS peoples expectations of how much large the market for the kind of software palantir makes is. 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201001005334/en/U.S.-Army-Research-Lab-Selects-Palantir-Technologies-Inc.-for-91M-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-Development

This is literally the backbone of everything AI that the government is about to invest in. Sure they're going to experiment with other research but if you do research you'll also find Palantir is the ONLY company that does anything remotely like this software that has anywhere near the kind of clearances like what is required for these contracts. They are currently a clearance level 5 and about to be the highest 6. The closest competitors are almost all a 3 or lower I'm not even sure if there's more than a single 4 and that stuff is crazy hard to get. 

But like again I'm an obsessive. I realize why people get so excited about the commercial side scaling and how it's very possible and can make them huge and it will. But I'm actually pretty sure the reason people like Cathy Wood has such a huge boner for them is that she realizes how MASSIVELY. And I mean MASSIVELY underestimated the amount of government revenue they will get from all this AI investing the United States and NATO are about to do. It's literally the next Manhattan project and they're absolutely going to be one of the biggest players developing it if not the biggest. I think it's funny because most people are pretty disinterested in the government stuff for Palantir but i really think the weaponized AI apollo stuff may be as big as anything could ever be. 




Also people got the insider selling stuff very very wrong. Tom Nash (love him or hate him I don't care) has a few really good recent videos where he explains it in basically full detail what was happening. The selling panicked a lot of retail investors during a time when the buying for growth markets had really slowed because of rate hike due to inflation scares and a ton of retail holders got scared and caused more selling and more people got scared because of that and sold and it really just was mass psychology in effect and a LOT of FUD and confusion. 

Basically a few executives karp in particular got billions of dollars worth of options that vest but literally expire so you have to exercise them which means you buy shares of the company at a strike price. Well because it's the company granting shares the strike price is literally 10 cents or something and these automatically have to vest at quarterly increments. So everytime karp was exercising he's actually buying shares. Like over 150 million in total maybe a lot more million SHARES not dollars. shares. And even those when he exercising he's buying shares technically from the company it ALL counts as profit on taxes and ITS NOT LONG TERM CAP GAINS ELIGIBLE. So over the last year plus this year he's essentially getting shares but the literal dollar value of those shares to the government counts as pure profit. So his total income which he's getting taxed at 40% of is in the BILLIONS yes billions. Because that's a lot to handle people that work for them actually automatically schedule sells of shares to cover the taxes so that there's no issue it's not even like him saying sell today and they do this.... TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INSIDER SELLING TO THE SEC. That's why it's automatically happening so no one can ever claim he's timing it. 

So listen cause here's where it gets important. The exercising of the shares counts as almost pure profits but remember he's receiving SHARES not dollars he doesn't actually get billions of dollars. So has to then sell SOME of the shares so he can pays taxes on that. Then when he sells the shares to pay the taxes for exercising he actually owes even more money if they went up from when he exercised. So everytime he's selling low its actually good for him because it's less ADDITIONAL PROFIT that he would owe taxes on.

 If he wasn't selling its because he thought it would go down even further and then he would actually owe less taxes overall. So if he thought it was going to tank he'd wait and actually get a nice fat discount on his taxes. 

I know this seems really crazy but I promise that's how it works you can look it up in detail but yeah shocking that mainstream media and redditors/youtubers who barely do research and have no real understanding of how these billion dollar compensations work would get it wrong. Unbelievable I know. If he had actually sold the massive overall percentage of his shares that some people claim he did the company would be at like $3-6 dollars not low 20s. Retail got confused because of market pressured due to interest rate fears from inflation and sold low (like retail always does) to institutions.",nmofz4,"Palantir DD if you want to understand company and it's history better (also insider ""selling"" explained in detail)"

What is Blue Apron?


Blue Apron (NYSE: APRN) was the forgotten step child, bad luck Brian, IPO of summer 2017 that priced below range and had the misfortune of debuting after Amazon bought Whole Foods. Since it’s debut, the stock has suffered dropping from nearly $150 per share (adjusted for a 2019 reverse-split necessitated to stay listed) to as low as approximately $2.00!


Why the Drop?


Management. Fucking. Sucked. The prior executive team essentially handed Chad Hello Fresh the keys to the kingdom, when they made the fatal error of betting that the “high affinity core users” would be enough to sustain the business. For this reason, they cut marketing to nearly nothing and attempted to realize operating leverage by shrinking the customer base only to its most prolific buyers.

This was stupid. HelloFresh did the opposite, essentially giving away meals, and they used it to stockpile market share. Put a chart up of HelloFresh customers against Blue Apron. You’ll see the two lines converge and a clear indication that HelloFresh stole most of their business. HelloFresh was one of the best trades of the past 5 years.

Blue Apron Might Go Under....


Today the company is in a dire place. Languishing away in Micro Cap hell at an $80M market cap, no one on Wall Street wants to cover these guys. Only their bankers, CG and MS, write them research and neither are overly optimistic. They’re in a shit spot with a credit line that mandates they keep $15M cash at all times, and they keep their customer base above 300K (thus far, they’ve struggled). They’re sitting on $29M and burn enough cash per Q that they might go below that $15M level (wouldn’t be a first). All signs are negative...


But I Think They Might Win


Blue Apron is under new management. Linda Kozlowski, is the former COO of ETSY and an ex-strategist at Alibaba. She believes HelloFresh did things right and she wants to right the ship. Her ballsy-ass plan is to ride the line on cash and go all in on customer growth. She realizes those customers are worth a lot more than income on the P&L, and that she needs to make the pot as big as she can. Thus far, it’s worked. Customers are up over 20% in the past two periods and retention rates are rising. We are seeing signs of operating leverage, and it opens a big possibility.


My Prediction

Management is buying shares. They know the company is not healthy. The only logic is that they have a plan that’s working. You can’t sell a dying business with a shrinking share, but you can certainly sell a growing community, that could be an accretive asset to a better capitalized entity. I think Linda is going either get the business in a position where it can refinance for better terms, or where it can be sold to create shareholder value via a strategic alternative.

If that happen, given this is priced for bankruptcy and ignored by the Street, the returns could easily reach the triple digits. I’m long and I plan to add on additional weakness.

Disclosure- I’m buying a stock that might go under. This is not advice! I’m stupid.",nmoit0,Blue Apron: Hero or Zero

Everyone is talking about how the squeeze didn't even happen and the shorts didn't cover yet. What I don't understand is why wouldn't that be possible? If short interest is 17%, so let's round up to about 100M shares. Today the volume traded was 700M shares. Couldn't 100M of those 700M have been the shorts covering? And if they didn't cover, today alone 700M shares were traded, why would 100M shares bought by shorts cause a squeeze if today 700M were traded?

I have been having this question for awhile, since I noticed the same with GME. In the days preceding January 28th (when GME reached its peak), the combined volume was several times the amount of float. How come the squeeze happened and why did it happen? If the volume was so high, couldn't the shorts have covered in the days preceding that?

I hope this makes sense and I really hope someone will be kind enough to explain a fellow retard who only knows about crayons what this all means.

Everything looked to have gone off successfully. We are now waiting on the data and craft to be analysed and inspected. This will take a few weeks according to Michael Colglazier.
That being said he had already outlined the test schedule in the earnings zoom call.

1st test flight - may 
2nd crewed flight - June 
3rd flight with R Branson on board late June/July 

4th flight this will be taking the Italian airforce on a training mission (600k a seat) late July


On the run in to the first test flight some possible maintenance issues appeared with the carrier plane White knight 2…. 
This indeed could have gone either way , after 2 weeks inspections it was decided that WK2 did not need to delay testing no maintenance was needed at this point. Scheduled Maintenance will commence in the fall after all tests have been completed.
Upon this news it is my opinion that the testing programme will go ahead as planned.

The market has responded accordingly and the stock is now up from $17-€31

With all these catalysts lined up before the end of the year and commercial operations looming for early 2022 things are looking up for Virgin Galactic.The success of the last test flight the company have now proven tech and concept.

220,,2021-05-28 09:17:32,t3_nmtt43,,wallstreetbets,"Trainline has taken a huge dip since the UK government's announcement of the plan to nationalise the railway network. The plan includes creating an online ticketing platform by Great British Railways which might have a huge blow on Trainline revenue. However, this platform does not yet exist and will probably take a couple of years to develop. Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed.

In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales.  Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%.  

I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time  for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

I am too lazy to type a full-on DD. If this gets enough traction then I will do it with numbers. Basically, this is the best ganja plant company on planet Earth and is undervalued af trading at 1.4x consensus rates compared to a trash peer group trading at 8x that on average. They are projected to have 115 stores EOY in Canada. They bought out FABCBD in the US and operate the largest E-Commerce platforms for cannabis in the world. Many of you have probably heard of GrassCity, CBDCity, and Smoke Cartel (they own these). They have celebrity licensing with Snoop and others and thousands of SKUs. They have a super clean balance sheet and positive adjusted EBITDA. They are cash positive and vertically integrated and scaling massively YOY with a dynamic team in place. They have plans to expand world-wide and make great deals and acquisitions monthly. This is truly the best weed play on the entire market with tremendous upside. They just got approved to trade on the NASDAQ as well. It is currently trading at around $8. Personal PT EOY is $50. I can easily see this at $500 in 6 years or so.

Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling variants so as time goes on,and variants get worse and other vaccines get more ineffective ...protein vaccines will be the most in demand. So far and back is the only protein vaccine, it's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines so other protein competitors will be far behind and they will have an a moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing they teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now second phase at 77% efficacy. Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine. It will be combining flu and covid vaccine by 2025.

This follows a day of gains for the Dow and S&P, while the Nasdaq was flat. The Russell 2000 rallied 1% yesterday.

Those gains don’t tell the whole story however, as this week has seen a marked reversal in risk appetite. The Nasdaq is up 2% for the week, with the S&P up about 1%. Companies like Boeing, Ford, Roblox, AMC, and GameStop have seen dramatic rallies.

We have a couple of economic reports today that could shed more light on consumer spending and inflation. The Personal Income and consumer spending reports and PCE Core Price Index, the Fed’s preferred gauge for inflation, are out at 0830. Expectations on the PCE are for a 2.9% year-over-year print for April.

We also have Chicago PMIs out at 0945. Last month saw a record (I think) 72.1 reading. Expectations for this month are for 68. Obviously both of these readings are well above the 50 level separating expansion from contraction.

Happy early Memorial Day! Forecasts are for a huge surge in travel this weekend. (60% YoY increase, according to AAA). This means two things: 1) If you haven’t left by now you will hit traffic. Put that in the books And 2) The pandemic appears to be well and truly over and reopening in full effect. So it makes sense for risk assets to be pushing higher again.",,

In my bull case the price shoots up to PLN 400 over the next 4 years and in the worst case it goes down to PLN 100 (+100% vs -41%). High risk, high reward suitable for my own risk tolerance.

There are a couple of catalyst this year that will help this stock:  
\- Next gen release of the Witcher 3 to PS5 / Series X / PC  
\- Next gen release of Cyberpunk 2077 to PS5 and Series X

And they are currently transforming CDPR to develop The Witcher 4 and Cyberpunk 2077 sequel at the same time. So they will be able to launch titles in shorter timeframes.  
The Development team of CD Projekt RED is extremely passionate about creating games and you can follow the stream from Pawel Sasko every sunday where he goes to the development process of Cyberpunk 2077.

  
We are at a point in the gaming industry where the publishers are trying to maximize profits by overmonetizing games and focussing on mobile games.  
And that true triple A development is becoming less lucrative.  
The big dogs that understand Triple A development are buying the gaming studio's dedicated at creating these titles looking at you Sony, Microsoft (if you want to be safe, invest here).   
And the big publishers are starting to dissappear from this space except for the ones that are playing close attention to providing value at consumers, looking at you Capcom.  


Capcom is focussed on deliverying value to the customer after playing around with overmonetizing DLC etc.. This is noticeable in their huge succes from the latest years (resident evil 8 launch, Final Fantasy remake etc.) and their stock is being rewarded for this.  
As a small cap gaming studio: CDPR that is focussed on providing value to the customer with a passionate development time behind this, I am confident in placing a long term bet here.",,

I'll be trying to get out of the June $20 without a loss sometime in the next week or two. Other June and the July stuff I'm gonna ride for a bit and try and get some money. On the following pull back / consolidation phase I'll buy calls for the next leg.

**DD and back story -**

**The Good**

We'll get to that part in a bit

**The bad**

The history: GE was a massive company, has been around forever and was known as one of the quintessential American companies. They became this massive conglomerate that bought up companies left and right leading up to the mortgage backed securities bonanza in the mid 2000's. Not sure I'll need to remind everyone what happened at the end of that (Rhymed with Semen Mothers) but GE took it particularly bad. See after the 2008 / 2009 meltdown it turned out that not only had they lost a ton of money on derivatives and other financial products but (as would become public later) they lied to investors about it on disclosures and jumped through hoops to keep investors from finding out just how bad the situation was. Add to that some really badly timed all cash acquisitions that worked out terribly and the company was about ready to go belly up.

**The Ugly**

There is a reason that while the whole world got its act back together after 2009, GE continued to play act a paraplegic thrown in the deep end of a pool. The stock took beating after beating as news kept coming out about acquisitions that went bad (massive write downs), accounting fraud and various other losses. After getting rid of their CEO they brought in someone else to try and turn things around, then after a very short run they replaced that guy with the current CEO Larry Culp. They basically had to bribe / beg him to take the job, getting him to leave a cushy gig at Harvard where he was basically in working retirement after having earned a reputation as a corporate turn around guru.

**Making our way back to the good**

While GE's stock continued to flounder Culp got busy and started to shake things up. First he started selling divisions and companies. Some of them had been with GE forever, like the lightbulb divisions, others were acquisitions (some of which only a few years old) that were sold off. This wasn't about profiting by spinning something off - it was about cutting losses and making sense out of a massive company that didn't have a functioning balance sheet. Some of the chunks that were sold were profitable and many were not. The net effect was that he cut operating expenses more than he cut operating revenue, moving free cash flow (FCF) in the right direction (albeit still negative at this point) and raising cash from the sales.

They slashed the dividend to 1 penny. People were clutching their pearls and screaming! I mean... It was GE for Pete's sake. They've had a good dividend forEVER! This dragged the stock down more. But it shoved FCF in the right direction.

Between significantly improved FCF and money raised from selling off divisions and assets GE managed to cut its TOTAL debt from $130 BILLION to $71 BILLION (which is about where it is right now, although they do have more than $25 billion cash on hand). Oh yeah they also own 25% of Baker Hughes (valued at about $6.5 billion, that is after they sold $1 billion worth of it recently), they are also selling GECAS (airline leasing company that owned airliners and rented them out to airlines and other companies) to the global leader in the space. In return for shedding this division, which due to structural issues and insufficient scale to create real efficiencies, was losing GE $700 million a year in FCF, GE is getting $24 billion in cash, $1 billion in cash equivalents and $6 billion worth of a company (45% of the company's stock) that happens to be beaten up at the moment but is the world's largest airline leasing company and is about to have a gang buster year as airlines struggle to find planes. Could easily see the value of that swelling and then them dumping it to pay down even more debt.

**The Good - you may have to squint but it is there. I swear**

GE is now a rather lean company, especially compared to the mess that existed 5 years ago. I've given you the current cash / debt position. From that alone, doesn't seem great but I do ask that you keep in mind the trend line, from $130BB to $71BB over 5 years.

Today GE is made up of 4 divisions (they no longer make home appliances, it isn't one of the divisions. yes I know, they still are on the market but the stuff sold under the GE name in home appliances is by actually made by the Haier conglomerate and.... never mind):

**HealthCare** \- Not sure if any of you have had an MRI but if you had you may have had the same weird experience I did. Walking into the room, kind of nervous to get this big medical test to find out what is wrong with my ::Insert body party here:: and being confronted with the biggest GE logo I have EVER seen. Embossed into the side of this MRI machine. Anyway, whether you were aware of it or not GE makes a lot of tech for healthcare. from MRI machines to ultrasounds and tons of other stuff. It is a growing business that is consistently profitable and ***something*** *:: cough cough COVID knocked us on our butt and hospitals need to retool and get better::* tells me that healthcare spending is going to be rising a lot this year and next year.

**Energy -** Basically this is about steam turbines used for 20th century electricity generation (and storage in some cases). Talking huge turbines used in natural gas, oil, coal, nuclear and geothermal power plants (I think GE itself may consider Hydro power plant turbines part of this sector but I'm listing them below because that makes more sense). While not very forward looking this business has the potential to generate significant FCF over the next few years maybe even a decade or more. While some of these power sources are on their way out others (like natural gas) have seen a surge in utilization and some (nuclear) seem to be about to make a comeback. This chunk of GE is usually profitable, although not hugely so. That being said, between what happened in Texas which will require several power plants to be overhauled or replaced, existing service and new equipment contracts and the potential to grow, I think this is a worthwhile business unit to keep around.

**Renewable Energy -** Some solar, a decent amount of hydro power, a growing pumped storage segment and WIND TURBINES. These electrical generators (and in the case of pumped storage - mechanical batteries) are one of the most exciting areas for me personally when looking at the GE story. GE briefly snagged the title as producing the world's largest wind turbine (14 MW) and it is the largest one that many countries have certified for use. This thing is bonkers, every rotation of the blades produces enough electricity to power roughly 4,000 homes for a DAY. It is a monster and it has been selected for use in the next phase of the world's largest offshore wind farm and the first phase of the US' first large offshore windfarm. GE also makes onshore wind turbines, they make the truly massive turbines used in huge hydro electric damns and they also make turbines for use in pumped storage\*. This segment has up till now been generation negative FCF (losing money) however it is growing by leaps and bounds and seems poised to start adding to positive FCF a little this year or next and then growing exponentially.

\*Pumped storage is really cool. Basically you create a large body of water (like a lake) by using excess electricity made by solar and wind when it is available to pump water up hill. Then, when you need more electricity because it is night time or the wind isn't blowing you throw the turbine in reverse and it acts as a hydro electric damn.

**Aviation** \- This is the crown jewel of GE although in a weird twist of fait it delivered a kick to the nuts just as things started turning around. Needless to go into much detail as to why a business that makes its money building and servicing jet engines might be negatively effected when air travel takes a year and a half pause. That being said GE's newest engines are showing a great track record of winning orders. Doing this DD I found out that apparently when you buy commercial airliners you get to pick what engines you want (if there are more than one option) kind of like when you buy a car and pick whether you want the in dash CD player or not. GE's engines are proving to be more efficient, more reliable and cheaper to operate than their main competitor Pratt and Whitney. That means that as everyone gets waxed and vaxed in preparation for the horney party boom we are about to witness airlines have started ordering planes again and in a big way. You see, during the covid crisis airlines didn't have many customers and what most of them did was they identified their oldest and/or most problematic aircraft and sold them off various other companies in other industries or to companies that lease aircraft to airlines when they need a few to fill a gap. Now that things are coming back online airlines are ordering more planes. As other parts of the world start to open up over time this should create sustained tail winds for this division.

Oh yeah and one thing that often seems to be overlooked is that while yes, the aviation division has been beat up, management has used this as an opportunity to streamline and improve operations. Both sales and maintenance saw significant drops in revenue however the drop in FCF was smaller than would be expected because the whole time GE was improving its margins. Now as their order book starts filling up the aviation division is significantly leaner and more optimized which should mean that when the FCF starts up again this fall or this winter it should turn into a firehose.

**Other points of interest**

GE has announced a 1 for 8 stock split (that is a reverse split, for every 8 shares you own you will end up with 1 share that is worth 8X the pre split value). This makes sense for a few reasons.

1. GE has a massive number of shares outstanding and doing this reverse split will bring its stock price (adjusted for market cap) within line with its piers and should put it in a position to re-enter the DOW. Doing so will create demand for the shares as it is added to funds that track that index.
2. Once GE reinstates its dividend (which will be another catalyst for the stock to continue upwards) the lower share count means a slower drain on FCF since I imagine they will incrementally increase the dividend. It seems silly because it doesn't really matter how many shares except when you consider that they have so many that if you decide to go from a dividend of $0.01 to $0.10 the difference in share float would be hundreds of millions annualized in FCF. Obviously the target yield wouldn't be impacted but even this small thing can have a real impact in speeding up the debt reduction.
3. I fully expect that as the stock price increases and then the reverse split happens GE will do a share issuance to raise a few billion to pay down the debt. I view that as a buying opportunity as any drop in share price should be short lived and I expect the resulting reduction in debt will mean net / net share prices will increase due to the issuance.

On that note GE has committed to a stated target of 2.5 times EBITDA (which is the cutoff for investment grade securities) from the current 6 times EBITDA. Getting to investment grade will create increased upside pressure, that is why I'm saying the stock will go up when they issue more shares (even though there will likely be a temporary dip at that time).",nmkhyz,GE - a bull Thesis (F off haters - Imma go 🚀🚀🚀🚀 to the MOON)

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote...

and balking at even a penny of additional liquidity. How the Fed will continue to monetize debt then, when the repo system is now out of collateral, is anyone's guess.

By mid-July, we’ll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase higher yields in the FX swap market amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative

Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks.

Consider this also . Annual mining output is roughly 800-1000 million ounces of silver a year. They use around those numbers as well 900M a year. It's a very tight market. 330 million americans. Say 10% of americans buy 100oz physical. 28usd x 100 = 2800USD quite affordable.. 10% of 330 million = 33 million 33 million x 100oz  330 million ounces off the market. That is a big supply shortage not counting in the domino effect.........


Silver rose 35 x in the 1970s,Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. When inflation hit 3.5 silver hit 50 in 2011 . Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms.

As a ticket here I prefer PSLV, but all ETFs essentially share the same traits in that you can invest extremely large sums of money with them and it is highly liquid to get in and out of. Only the whale investors can actually take physical out, but if they are taking it out, it’s not to bring home 1,000 oz bars to use as doorstops, but probably to transfer to a vault of their choosing. These will generally move with the price of the underlying metal. Some of these ETFs  like slv  you can buy call options with, which can provide you some upside leverage. However, the idea here is to park large sums of money through your brokerage with them to realize gains over a long term. The one major downside most of these have is you are giving your money to the trust, and the trust owns the metal not you and mostly those trusts are not favored to metal price spike .",nmkmcq,"Rrp explosion , inflation spike and results for precious metal"

so a bit of a preface, i'm pretty new to investing, but one thing i do know is science, so hear me out.

Tesla is known as a good long term investment because of the fact that eventually we are all going to need electric cars in hope to reduce our carbon emissions as low as possible, meaning the abandonment of the internal combustion engine... or does it? recently in the past few years there have been a lot of study's released proving that synthetic fuel or fuel basically made of of hydrogen with renewable energy like wind power is actually as carbon neutral as electric engines, i think this is dooming to tesla for a few reasons.

1. synthetic fuel is MUCH more convenient then electric. synthetic fuel is able to work in the internal combustion engine which means that people wouldn't have to replace their cars. the base model of the cheapest tesla is 35,000 dollars USD which a lot of family's(including mine) can't afford to spend on a new car, especially if our current one is working. so that's thousands of cars being left in the dust while they can be used and have a neutral carbon footprint.
2. tesla problems. from what i have heard tesla's are built like sh#t, low quality and poor assembly make them prone to needing repairs, which normal car mechanics are not equipped or trained to deal with because of the obvious. also tesla's are extremely heavy, i don't really care about that but apparently that's a huge turn off for others.
3. other industry's. so tesla and other electric car company's make electric cars, not planes or boats, so that means that those to major contributors are left out to still release a lot of co2. with synthetic fuel they can switch alongside cars making it better in that sense.
4. car fans. so i know a lot of car enthusiasts who, all hate tesla's and wouldn't buy one if they had to. they would much rather stick to their cars like Lamborghini's and other old cars that would get left out with electric cars but would still be as usable synthetic, and considering the amount of car enthusiasts in the world and how much they affect the auto market i don't see it panning out there.
5. timing. so no matter what number you agree on for how long it's going to take to switch completely electric it's stupid. so like i said earlier the majority of family's can't just drop thirty five k on a new car meaning it would take awhile to be able to get everyone electric plus the time and money it would take to build up the infrastructure to switch electric but considering that synthetic fuel uses the same stuff as petrol it would be much easier to keep going synthetic.
6. back on the subject of time, i saw a study saying we could switch completely synthetic by 2024 if we tried. whomever if you look at electric you see company's like GM saying they will have 50 new electric MODELS by 2050, do we really have that time? science say's no.

so if you take these reasons ( and they are not all, i have a few more ) into consideration tesla now might be a good stock with nice returns but now that synthetics are becoming more and more possible i am starting to think they might actually be our future. like i said I'm pretty new and relatively dumb on the mentality of other investors please leave your opinion below.",nml65m,Tesla might be a bad future investment.

Palantir Options are dirt cheap and there is a lot of eyes on it now. Call options with 100+ day expiry and within $1 of strike are selling for less than $2 per contract. Lots of analysts very bullish on this stock. As always do your own DD.

See you at the top boys.

Position: $40c June 17 '22

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Palantir will MOON soon. Get on board before we take off.

1. The company itself, Palantir; one of the only 2 **unicorn** startups to emerge from the defense sector, focused on national security, alongside SpaceX.

A real company that has built its product for **18 years**, & **PROVEN** its products on national level (UK Vaccination), US ARMY , NAVY and soon AIRFORCE, (BP) OIL&GAS Sector, Law Agency, Mining sector (rio tinto), IBM cloud, etc.

2) There were news of Palantir's Enterprise Resource Planning system with Amazon's cloud service platform Amazon Web Services, making it available to all AWS customers. AND PROVEN to be so value-adding, BP used it and saved 50 million in working capital within 2 weeks of installation, with the potential to do more if applied across their worldwide supply chain. The ERP suite can be deployed within days for all AWS customer. This is HUGE , and DOWNPLAYED last friday because of all the market shits that have been going on.

3) I would also say a lot other recent PLTR news have been downplayed, and PLTR always doesn't make a huge marketing about their announcements, like Karp has said, they believe in the long term, the value of PLTR would reveal itself.

4) The insider selloff has made the company undervalued. Remember when insiders were selling their 20% shares in direct listing at $7.50? How undervalued they were before people including Cathie Wood/ArkInvest started to realize and it rose to $27 within a month? You can take advantage of the insiders' selloffs of their long term held shares, infact, i think they are done (a lot were sold initially, but no selloff for last week) and we are going to the fking moon.

5) All the paperhands' shares and insiders' shares are going to diamond hands like Cathie Wood, who are going to hold for years. I see Cathie Wood buying PLTR like TSLA, don't forget Cathie Wood bought TSLA in 2018 (that's some insane gains), and she is the god among all fund managers when it comes to spotting a disruptive/growth stock, she literally does this for a living and got famed as the best investor now at the age of 65.

6) Cathie Wood just keep buying PLTR with 2 ARK funds, owns over 1% of Palantir, and she's not done yet. She bought at $30, $25, every $23.You are literally getting an insurance that Cathie wood would save your ass IF the stock goes under.

7) It's literally inevitable for PLTR to get more contracts and increase its revenue and growth... also not forgetting the stickiness of the contracts and business, it's hard to forgo the product after u have integrated it into your business.

8) In this Era of Big Data, PLTR is literally the leader in the dominating industry of the near future, which company/service is not going to use the best Data Analytics software in the future or even now?

9) Proven Track Record of HUGE Growth and credibility , proven 42% revenue growth YoY, expected 45% for next quarter, AT LEAST 30% for next 5 years, words of Karp. Last Year, Karp said at least 30% for YoY and he did 42% YoY like a boss.

10) Don't forget we got a $34 Price Target from Goldman Sachs after the earnings

11) If investors are justifying growth stocks' value with growth, I see Palantir time and time proven overperformed growth rate as the most bullish factor. Also, its cost is going to drive down because the main costs are from employee stock options now, which will expire in the future. And the accumulation of sticky contracts, it's also easier to maintain/update software installation than installing the software initially in new companies. It also has a huge monopoly in the fast growing industry. (added point from replying a comment)

12) It's ok that the some retards don't join us now, because they will eventually join us in the future, they always join after the rocket is halfway to the moon, they always do. And when that happens, we will still welcome them.",nmlb2d,Palantir Options - DIRT CHEAP

The above link is what I said 2 days ago. At the time EXPI was hovering around $28.50 and since then it has shot up to about $32.27 on what appears to be about average volume for the stock. 

I still think they are going to have a huge share buyback of over 14m shares (their buyback program was increased from 75m to 475m) in stock and add to the insider owned shares which is now at 54.80% over the week it has gone up about 2%. Which is a bullish signal. If 14m shares were bought that would leave about 51m shares to be traded publicly and the insider owned share percentage would go to about 62% which would be a large driving factor in the price going up due to scarcity. Also the buyback would be large enough to trigger a massive buy and I would jizz my pants.",nmnbfw,*UPDATE* Why I still Think EXPI Is Going To $60 In 4-6 Weeks (up 10.59% this week)

[When we last left our hero,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrly28/the_legend_of_utheemperorofjenks_aka_ornamental/) he had just lost all of his rent money and what he could advance from credit cards on a failed Super Bowl bet, and a YOLO on “Rhodium” that he ordered from a sketchy Slovakian Wish.com ripoff. Alas, it was, of course, fake, and he was broke and depressed. It might have been the first fatal case of autism. He thought to himself “Am I really that retarded?” Then, he realized “No, it must be Oklahoma that’s retarded!”

So, [after a brief case of violent diarrhea from Oklahoma Grocery Store sushi](https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/lrslbb/psa_do_not_eat_grocery_store_sushi_right_now/), he was ready to hatch his plan! Uruguay! Yes, Uruguay. [He was going to move to Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lh5igx/c%C3%B3mo_se_puede_llegar_a_melo_desde_montevideo_sin/)

His plans for this move could’ve been anyone’s guess. One possibility he inquired about was [how to be a Tea Blendmaster.](https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/lfga0m/how_does_one_become_a_blendmaster/) [Another was him possibly reconnecting with God.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/lsij6j/agnostic_jew_seeking_faith_in_god/) Yet, he seemed to be asking questions about another topic more often than the others...

[Bees.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lxcnt1/c%C3%B3mo_es_la_legalidad_de_la_apicultura_informal/)

Specifically, beekeeping, a topic he admitted he had no experience in, [as evident from him looking for any book on the subject as an introduction months before.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/)

What he planned on doing with the bees was anyone’s guess, and I doubt he thought it through that much either. One post **AFTER** he took possession of 200,000 bees (we’ll get to that later,) was [asking Americans if there was a demand for mead in the states.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/) So, was he thinking of importing Uruguayan honey to the US to be made into mead? Was he going to make it himself? Did he move to another continent for no reason? Let’s all find out!

A little more than 2 months ago, he finally did it. [He moved to Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/m9ejpn/la_paloma/) And about a week after that, [he was driving a truck filled with 200k bees across his new country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/) Based on replies in that thread, he was aiming to have [a monopoly on beekeeping in the country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/gt48gke/) 

And for a while, things were kind ok for our young Autist. [He picked up his hives without complication.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mtkkf3/about_to_upsize_my_apiary_whats_the_best_layout/) [And then he settled into Melo, Uruguay, and set up his apiary ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/n1jnte/my_humble_apiary_near_melo_uruguay/). Life was good.

But, trouble was afoot. According to a reply, [the species he was planning on keeping had literally never been kept by keepers in Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mtkkf3/about_to_upsize_my_apiary_whats_the_best_layout/gv0viej/) And then, disaster struck. [He went to TIFU to post his tale of spreading an invasive species in an industry he knew nothing about.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/nmd69k/tifu_by_importing_bees_to_uruguay/)

Indeed, he had no idea even what a bee was until he stumbled his way through a book, and then decided to YOLO into honey in Uruguay. He somehow got in touch with an ecology professor in Montevideo that would help him set things up in exchange for grad students fucking with them every now and again. Oh, and the bees were from fucking Myanmar. Handshake agreement, of course. Total Chad move.

And like I said before, the rest went without incident for a while. It would take the bees “a year” to make honey, so he just kinda hung out, stayed busy, and tried to find part time work in a foreign country he arrived in 2.5 months earlier.

And then, the professor ghosted him. Just disappeared. Shortly thereafter, government agents come out about this kid from Oklahoma illegally importing a non-native bee to their country. Apparently his bees had been fucking with other apiaries. So, he did probably the smartest thing he’s ever done.

He ran.

He fucking ran from the Uruguayan government, took a plane to LAX, and arrived with $14 to his name. His friend sent him $100, which wasn’t enough to go back to Oklahoma, so he took a $75 flight to Seattle, where he is also not from.

His last post is from a train out of the airport, with $39 to his name. I don’t know what is in store for him, but I know that $39 is as good as spent on urchin futures or whatever market he’s going to crash up there.

721,,2021-05-28 03:12:37,t3_nmofz4,,wallstreetbets,"This started as a comment reply but I thought maybe people would like reading it. I've been researching Palantir since literally late November 2020 and I have nearly my entire portfolio in LEAPS expiring January 2023. So I have continually done more research on them this is just the basics to clear up confusion and help people who don't understand it because it's hard to hear all the hype and stuff. Also AMC to the moon tomorrow for my FDs I bought!! Don't judge me it's just fun to be in on the action on weeks like this.


So you should think of palantir as basically three companies and they actually are very far from unprofitable. 

They developed the really massive government software (gotham) specifically as a result of an interaction that happened to Peter Thiel while he was at paypal. They were losing millions to foreign scammers at paypal and the solution ended up being a high quality algorithm that flagged the most likely scam transactions and then allowed analysts to efficiently double check and verify the real scam transactions.

 It essentially was using what computers are efficient at (sorting through massive amounts of data) and then combining that with what humans are good at (looking at the more complex nuances that at least at that point computer algorithms were incapable of doing) and augmenting the humans ability to make complex decisions by rapidly sorting through the incoming data and bringing everything good to their attention.

They fixed paypals using this method and literally made the company profitable overnight because of fixing how much they were losing in the scam transactions. The FBI contacted PayPal and Thiel about using that initial software. That was literally his inspiration for what would become Palantir. He goes over it in huge detail in his book zero to one. If you make an audible account you can read it for free and find the chapter I'm talking about.

Then for 15 years they perfected the government software into the absolute nearly monopoly it is now in government intelligence augmentation software. The whole time though they reinvested almost everything for the last 10 years into building the commercial software (Foundry). That side of the business has only been live for a VERY short time and initially they literally didn't spend a single dollar on marketing their first commercial clients sought THEM out because of their insane reputation with the government. Foundry helps with supply chains and all kinds of other important data  insights. But if you want a recent example the NIH and the NHS both used Foundry to figure out how to best distribute the vaccine and vaccine distribution in the US and Britain has far outpaced expectations. You think commercial companies aren't going to be interested in using the software that was literally proven on a level like that?

 They're only just now adding huge amounts of people to their sales teams literally in the last six months which if you read Peter thiels book is insane for the stock because they have this crazy long term plan and he literally talks about how when they get to a certain point and start adding sales as a full sector of the company it means that is the company the company plans to BEGIN scaling. Meaning they're this big and they literally only just started on the scaling part. Which they've also said in tons of interviews if you're a die hard Palantirian like me. 



They actually also have the third side of the  business which is their actual like full AI for weaponization and war and defense for the government. Gotham is like helping analysts and commanders lead and even helping police or agents figure out what's going on. This other software is different. It's called Apollo and its only at the beginning too. It's like pure AI machine learning AI handles everything stuff. Go find a video called pentagon head of NSC briefs public on AI I think it's on the PBS channel on YouTube or some shit. Or you can listen to Joe Biden talk about how we're going to double our percentage of gdp spending on AI. The amount of government money that's going to go into AI as a weapon to compete with China DWARFS peoples expectations of how much large the market for the kind of software palantir makes is. 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201001005334/en/U.S.-Army-Research-Lab-Selects-Palantir-Technologies-Inc.-for-91M-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-Development

This is literally the backbone of everything AI that the government is about to invest in. Sure they're going to experiment with other research but if you do research you'll also find Palantir is the ONLY company that does anything remotely like this software that has anywhere near the kind of clearances like what is required for these contracts. They are currently a clearance level 5 and about to be the highest 6. The closest competitors are almost all a 3 or lower I'm not even sure if there's more than a single 4 and that stuff is crazy hard to get. 

But like again I'm an obsessive. I realize why people get so excited about the commercial side scaling and how it's very possible and can make them huge and it will. But I'm actually pretty sure the reason people like Cathy Wood has such a huge boner for them is that she realizes how MASSIVELY. And I mean MASSIVELY underestimated the amount of government revenue they will get from all this AI investing the United States and NATO are about to do. It's literally the next Manhattan project and they're absolutely going to be one of the biggest players developing it if not the biggest. I think it's funny because most people are pretty disinterested in the government stuff for Palantir but i really think the weaponized AI apollo stuff may be as big as anything could ever be. 




Also people got the insider selling stuff very very wrong. Tom Nash (love him or hate him I don't care) has a few really good recent videos where he explains it in basically full detail what was happening. The selling panicked a lot of retail investors during a time when the buying for growth markets had really slowed because of rate hike due to inflation scares and a ton of retail holders got scared and caused more selling and more people got scared because of that and sold and it really just was mass psychology in effect and a LOT of FUD and confusion. 

Basically a few executives karp in particular got billions of dollars worth of options that vest but literally expire so you have to exercise them which means you buy shares of the company at a strike price. Well because it's the company granting shares the strike price is literally 10 cents or something and these automatically have to vest at quarterly increments. So everytime karp was exercising he's actually buying shares. Like over 150 million in total maybe a lot more million SHARES not dollars. shares. And even those when he exercising he's buying shares technically from the company it ALL counts as profit on taxes and ITS NOT LONG TERM CAP GAINS ELIGIBLE. So over the last year plus this year he's essentially getting shares but the literal dollar value of those shares to the government counts as pure profit. So his total income which he's getting taxed at 40% of is in the BILLIONS yes billions. Because that's a lot to handle people that work for them actually automatically schedule sells of shares to cover the taxes so that there's no issue it's not even like him saying sell today and they do this.... TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INSIDER SELLING TO THE SEC. That's why it's automatically happening so no one can ever claim he's timing it. 

So listen cause here's where it gets important. The exercising of the shares counts as almost pure profits but remember he's receiving SHARES not dollars he doesn't actually get billions of dollars. So has to then sell SOME of the shares so he can pays taxes on that. Then when he sells the shares to pay the taxes for exercising he actually owes even more money if they went up from when he exercised. So everytime he's selling low its actually good for him because it's less ADDITIONAL PROFIT that he would owe taxes on.

 If he wasn't selling its because he thought it would go down even further and then he would actually owe less taxes overall. So if he thought it was going to tank he'd wait and actually get a nice fat discount on his taxes. 

I know this seems really crazy but I promise that's how it works you can look it up in detail but yeah shocking that mainstream media and redditors/youtubers who barely do research and have no real understanding of how these billion dollar compensations work would get it wrong. Unbelievable I know. If he had actually sold the massive overall percentage of his shares that some people claim he did the company would be at like $3-6 dollars not low 20s. Retail got confused because of market pressured due to interest rate fears from inflation and sold low (like retail always does) to institutions.",nmofz4,"Palantir DD if you want to understand company and it's history better (also insider ""selling"" explained in detail)"

What is Blue Apron?


Blue Apron (NYSE: APRN) was the forgotten step child, bad luck Brian, IPO of summer 2017 that priced below range and had the misfortune of debuting after Amazon bought Whole Foods. Since it’s debut, the stock has suffered dropping from nearly $150 per share (adjusted for a 2019 reverse-split necessitated to stay listed) to as low as approximately $2.00!


Why the Drop?


Management. Fucking. Sucked. The prior executive team essentially handed Chad Hello Fresh the keys to the kingdom, when they made the fatal error of betting that the “high affinity core users” would be enough to sustain the business. For this reason, they cut marketing to nearly nothing and attempted to realize operating leverage by shrinking the customer base only to its most prolific buyers.

This was stupid. HelloFresh did the opposite, essentially giving away meals, and they used it to stockpile market share. Put a chart up of HelloFresh customers against Blue Apron. You’ll see the two lines converge and a clear indication that HelloFresh stole most of their business. HelloFresh was one of the best trades of the past 5 years. Look at the chart, look at the sales, and look at the margins. They have managed to achieve operating leverage by employing affordable pricing and emphasizing retention.


Blue Apron Might Go Under....


Today the company is in a dire place. Languishing away in Micro Cap hell at an $80M market cap, no one on Wall Street wants to cover these guys. Only their bankers, CG and MS, write them research and neither are overly optimistic. They’re in a shit spot with a credit line that mandates they keep $15M cash at all times, and they keep their customer base above 300K (thus far, they’ve struggled). They’re sitting on $29M and burn enough cash per Q that they might go below that $15M level (wouldn’t be a first). All signs are negative...


But I Think They Might Win


Blue Apron is under new management. Linda Kozlowski, is the former COO of ETSY and an ex-strategist at Alibaba. She believes HelloFresh did things right and she wants to right the ship. Her ballsy-ass plan is to ride the line on cash and go all in on customer growth. She realizes those customers are worth a lot more than income on the P&L, and that she needs to make the pot as big as she can. Thus far, it’s worked. Customers are up over 20% in the past two periods and retention rates are rising. We are seeing signs of operating leverage, and it opens a big possibility.


My Prediction

Management is buying shares. They know the company is not healthy. The only logic is that they have a plan that’s working. You can’t sell a dying business with a shrinking share, but you can certainly sell a growing community, that could be an accretive asset to a better capitalized entity. I think Linda is going either get the business in a position where it can refinance for better terms, or where it can be sold to create shareholder value via a strategic alternative.

If that happen, given this is priced for bankruptcy and ignored by the Street, the returns could easily reach the triple digits. I’m long and I plan to add on additional weakness.

Everyone is talking about how the squeeze didn't even happen and the shorts didn't cover yet. What I don't understand is why wouldn't that be possible? If short interest is 17%, so let's round up to about 100M shares. Today the volume traded was 700M shares. Couldn't 100M of those 700M have been the shorts covering? And if they didn't cover, today alone 700M shares were traded, why would 100M shares bought by shorts cause a squeeze if today 700M were traded?

I have been having this question for awhile, since I noticed the same with GME. In the days preceding January 28th (when GME reached its peak), the combined volume was several times the amount of float. How come the squeeze happened and why did it happen? If the volume was so high, couldn't the shorts have covered in the days preceding that?

With all these catalysts lined up before the end of the year and commercial operations looming for early 2022 things are looking up for Virgin Galactic.The success of the last test flight the company have now proven tech and concept. 
Also with revenue now coming in Nasa who are conducting micro gravity analysis.
Also international training for military pilots and astronauts.
Commercial flights look imminent.
Space ports planned for around the globe and intercontinental travel looming.

I had a look at $BB and assume that we finally formed the bottom. In the last few days we saw a sharp rise which might continue in the next weeks. If we can break the 12$ resistance, the next targets would be aroung 25-28$. 

Using Elliot wave theory we are probably at the end of the correction wave 4 and now began with the bullish wave 5.

Price targets:

\#1 12$

\#2 25$

\#3 48$

The risk/reward is worth entering a trade here. I bought yesterday aroung 10$. My stop loss is below 8$.

758,,2021-05-28 09:17:32,t3_nmtt43,,wallstreetbets,"Trainline has taken a huge dip since the UK government's announcement of the plan to nationalise the railway network. The plan includes creating an online ticketing platform by Great British Railways which might have a huge blow on Trainline revenue. However, this platform does not yet exist and will probably take a couple of years to develop. Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed.

In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales.  Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%.  

I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time  for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

They have a super clean balance sheet and positive adjusted EBITDA. They are cash positive and vertically integrated and scaling massively YOY with a dynamic team in place. They have plans to expand world-wide and make great deals and acquisitions monthly. This is truly the best weed play on the entire market with tremendous upside. They just got approved to trade on the NASDAQ as well. It is currently trading at around $8. Personal PT EOY is $50. I can easily see this at $500 in 6 years or so.

It could run up at the last minute or sell off, who fucking knows. If it were me I would let it ride till like an hour before market close and see where it's at, but understand it can go to zero.

1759,gzqv5e5,2021-05-28 11:13:25,t1_gzqv5e5,t1_gzpz0ic,wallstreetbets,"I’ve read all of their 8Ks, listened to their past several earnings calls, and I keep a model. I typed this on my phone so unfortunately so I didn’t get to be as detailed as I wanted.

They previously had EBITDA covenants which they breached. I believe they refinanced last year for this very reason. In fact, they’ve already breached their current covenants by going under $20M during 1Q. That’s why it’s been revised down to $15M.

The company enjoyed a pretty strong pull-forward in demand last year, but it wasn’t positioned to capitalized on it. They were already in a state of making the business lean and they didn’t have the resources to drive improvements in retention, rates. They were also hit by labor shortages, which caused increases in opex and further prevented the realization of operating leverage.

I don’t view dilution here as a major negative. When you bet on micro caps, you’re essentially betting a person is going to drive a turnaround in a broken business, and that’s what this is. We need flexibility to be able to focus on the growth initiative without being saddled by that debt. Oh, and before you waste time on the 8K, it’s $15M at all times and over 320K customers. There are also a bunch of warrants associated with the offering (dilutive), at $0.01 per share. Again, bad signs.

Look at HelloFresh. It started smaller than Blue Apron and it’s now a $15B company with high top-line growth rates. The negative risk factors for blue apron, low competitive moat, low switching cost, etc extend to them, so a campaign focused on low margin customer acquisition would be effective.

Regarding timing, I’ll save you some extra effort, as it’ll also have to be soon. They’re within the danger zone assuming their current cash burn remains constant. They’ve resolved many of their labor cost issues that drove expenses last year, so they estimate $2M at least will drop off the burn, but we’ll see what actual impact it had in August. Anyway, they’re coming up on headwinds from reopening reducing demand with more people wanting to travel and they’re also facing the worst seasonality for margins given the challenges of shipping perishable goods across the nation during the warmest months of the year.

This isn’t a “wait and see what happens” deal, it’s a near-term event where it’s either going under, or they’re going to find a way to continue on. I think it’s likely that, if they can continue to grow the customer base, they’re able to successfully execute on a strategic alternative. The fact is, I don’t think they’re going to be able to refi the debt or issue enough equity as the current conditions stand. Maybe they can find someone to do a PIPE offering, or ATM, but I think they’re going to be in a position where they sell to a better capitalized business. A big reason I believe this is that they’re so close to that cash covenant (again), but they’re still full throttle on growth. Usually a company in this stage would be aggressively trimming costs down to the bone, unless there was a reason not to be concerned. If you see any off-cycle sell-side research from Maria or Brian (or better yet a new analyst) that’s also a good clue that banking activity is up.

IMO- you can’t use traditional fundamentals to judge a micro cap stock. That’s how it got here. At this point it’s more prudent to use mosaic theory and anecdotal evidence as to how it can come back and what form that would take. The fundamentals totally point to bankruptcy, you’re right, but look at their announcement in Feb 2020 and compare it to their actions today. You’ll see the prior reflects a company preparing to die and the more recent implies something different.",,

What we need to expose the amount of illegal synthetics they own!! They want to show us some green. Not too much, just enough to get paper hands selling. If they can succeed in getting us to sell they will have more legitimate shares they can provide when the share count happens. We want them to get cuaght red handed, pants down. The more they can buy back before Friday the better they look. We want their heads on spikes. For the sake of all Apes. Resist the urge to surrender your legitimate shares.

They will be providing 1.1 billion doses to Covax an international effort to get vaccines across the world to mid to low income countries. Along with that they have a lot of contracts with higher end countries a contract with the EU is expected for 200 million doses. Right now their market cap is going to be what their revenue is going to be next year.

It has been proven with AMC and GME that the big boys will test these stop losses and whenever the real squeeze happens, you’ll see massive drops to attempt to trigger these sell orders. They play with $millions just to try and scare us and create fear selling with the stop losses. 
With enough people using them, the squeeze doesn’t happen and stocks continue status quo for hedge funds and retail(you and I) gets screwed yet again.

Then we see more pictures of the elites sipping champagne and laughing at us from their balconies, this time wiping fake tears with $100 bills. They will have won forever since regulations are being put into place to prevent large squeezes like this ever again.

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote...

and balking at even a penny of additional liquidity. How the Fed will continue to monetize debt then, when the repo system is now out of collateral, is anyone's guess.

By mid-July, we’ll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase higher yields in the FX swap market amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative

Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks.

Consider this also . Annual mining output is roughly 800-1000 million ounces of silver a year. They use around those numbers as well 900M a year. It's a very tight market. 330 million americans. Say 10% of americans buy 100oz physical. 28usd x 100 = 2800USD quite affordable.. 10% of 330 million = 33 million 33 million x 100oz  330 million ounces off the market. That is a big supply shortage not counting in the domino effect.........


Silver rose 35 x in the 1970s,Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. When inflation hit 3.5 silver hit 50 in 2011 . Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms.

As a ticket here I prefer PSLV, but all ETFs essentially share the same traits in that you can invest extremely large sums of money with them and it is highly liquid to get in and out of. Only the whale investors can actually take physical out, but if they are taking it out, it’s not to bring home 1,000 oz bars to use as doorstops, but probably to transfer to a vault of their choosing. These will generally move with the price of the underlying metal. Some of these ETFs  like slv  you can buy call options with, which can provide you some upside leverage. However, the idea here is to park large sums of money through your brokerage with them to realize gains over a long term. The one major downside most of these have is you are giving your money to the trust, and the trust owns the metal not you and mostly those trusts are not favored to metal price spike .",nmkmcq,"Rrp explosion , inflation spike and results for precious metal"

so a bit of a preface, i'm pretty new to investing, but one thing i do know is science, so hear me out.

Tesla is known as a good long term investment because of the fact that eventually we are all going to need electric cars in hope to reduce our carbon emissions as low as possible, meaning the abandonment of the internal combustion engine... or does it? recently in the past few years there have been a lot of study's released proving that synthetic fuel or fuel basically made of of hydrogen with renewable energy like wind power is actually as carbon neutral as electric engines, i think this is dooming to tesla for a few reasons.

1. synthetic fuel is MUCH more convenient then electric. synthetic fuel is able to work in the internal combustion engine which means that people wouldn't have to replace their cars. the base model of the cheapest tesla is 35,000 dollars USD which a lot of family's(including mine) can't afford to spend on a new car, especially if our current one is working. so that's thousands of cars being left in the dust while they can be used and have a neutral carbon footprint.
2. tesla problems. from what i have heard tesla's are built like sh#t, low quality and poor assembly make them prone to needing repairs, which normal car mechanics are not equipped or trained to deal with because of the obvious. also tesla's are extremely heavy, i don't really care about that but apparently that's a huge turn off for others.
3. other industry's. so tesla and other electric car company's make electric cars, not planes or boats, so that means that those to major contributors are left out to still release a lot of co2. with synthetic fuel they can switch alongside cars making it better in that sense.
4. car fans. so i know a lot of car enthusiasts who, all hate tesla's and wouldn't buy one if they had to. they would much rather stick to their cars like Lamborghini's and other old cars that would get left out with electric cars but would still be as usable synthetic, and considering the amount of car enthusiasts in the world and how much they affect the auto market i don't see it panning out there.
5. timing. so no matter what number you agree on for how long it's going to take to switch completely electric it's stupid. so like i said earlier the majority of family's can't just drop thirty five k on a new car meaning it would take awhile to be able to get everyone electric plus the time and money it would take to build up the infrastructure to switch electric but considering that synthetic fuel uses the same stuff as petrol it would be much easier to keep going synthetic.
6. back on the subject of time, i saw a study saying we could switch completely synthetic by 2024 if we tried. whomever if you look at electric you see company's like GM saying they will have 50 new electric MODELS by 2050, do we really have that time? science say's no.

so if you take these reasons ( and they are not all, i have a few more ) into consideration tesla now might be a good stock with nice returns but now that synthetics are becoming more and more possible i am starting to think they might actually be our future. like i said I'm pretty new and relatively dumb on the mentality of other investors please leave your opinion below.",nml65m,Tesla might be a bad future investment.

3198,,2021-05-28 00:11:27,t3_nmlb2d,,wallstreetbets,"TLDR: Just loaded up on some Palantir Options with my sweet tax refund thanks to Uncle Sam <3.

Palantir Options are dirt cheap and there is a lot of eyes on it now. Call options with 100+ day expiry and within $1 of strike are selling for less than $2 per contract. Lots of analysts very bullish on this stock. As always do your own DD.

See you at the top boys.

Position: $40c June 17 '22

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Palantir will MOON soon. Get on board before we take off.

1. The company itself, Palantir; one of the only 2 **unicorn** startups to emerge from the defense sector, focused on national security, alongside SpaceX.

A real company that has built its product for **18 years**, & **PROVEN** its products on national level (UK Vaccination), US ARMY , NAVY and soon AIRFORCE, (BP) OIL&GAS Sector, Law Agency, Mining sector (rio tinto), IBM cloud, etc.

2) There were news of Palantir's Enterprise Resource Planning system with Amazon's cloud service platform Amazon Web Services, making it available to all AWS customers. AND PROVEN to be so value-adding, BP used it and saved 50 million in working capital within 2 weeks of installation, with the potential to do more if applied across their worldwide supply chain. The ERP suite can be deployed within days for all AWS customer. This is HUGE , and DOWNPLAYED last friday because of all the market shits that have been going on.

3) I would also say a lot other recent PLTR news have been downplayed, and PLTR always doesn't make a huge marketing about their announcements, like Karp has said, they believe in the long term, the value of PLTR would reveal itself.

4) The insider selloff has made the company undervalued. Remember when insiders were selling their 20% shares in direct listing at $7.50? How undervalued they were before people including Cathie Wood/ArkInvest started to realize and it rose to $27 within a month? You can take advantage of the insiders' selloffs of their long term held shares, infact, i think they are done (a lot were sold initially, but no selloff for last week) and we are going to the fking moon.

5) All the paperhands' shares and insiders' shares are going to diamond hands like Cathie Wood, who are going to hold for years. I see Cathie Wood buying PLTR like TSLA, don't forget Cathie Wood bought TSLA in 2018 (that's some insane gains), and she is the god among all fund managers when it comes to spotting a disruptive/growth stock, she literally does this for a living and got famed as the best investor now at the age of 65.

6) Cathie Wood just keep buying PLTR with 2 ARK funds, owns over 1% of Palantir, and she's not done yet. She bought at $30, $25, every $23.You are literally getting an insurance that Cathie wood would save your ass IF the stock goes under.

7) It's literally inevitable for PLTR to get more contracts and increase its revenue and growth... also not forgetting the stickiness of the contracts and business, it's hard to forgo the product after u have integrated it into your business.

8) In this Era of Big Data, PLTR is literally the leader in the dominating industry of the near future, which company/service is not going to use the best Data Analytics software in the future or even now?

9) Proven Track Record of HUGE Growth and credibility , proven 42% revenue growth YoY, expected 45% for next quarter, AT LEAST 30% for next 5 years, words of Karp. Last Year, Karp said at least 30% for YoY and he did 42% YoY like a boss.

10) Don't forget we got a $34 Price Target from Goldman Sachs after the earnings

11) If investors are justifying growth stocks' value with growth, I see Palantir time and time proven overperformed growth rate as the most bullish factor. Also, its cost is going to drive down because the main costs are from employee stock options now, which will expire in the future. And the accumulation of sticky contracts, it's also easier to maintain/update software installation than installing the software initially in new companies. It also has a huge monopoly in the fast growing industry. (added point from replying a comment)

12) It's ok that the some retards don't join us now, because they will eventually join us in the future, they always join after the rocket is halfway to the moon, they always do. And when that happens, we will still welcome them.",nmlb2d,Palantir Options - DIRT CHEAP

The above link is what I said 2 days ago. At the time EXPI was hovering around $28.50 and since then it has shot up to about $32.27 on what appears to be about average volume for the stock. 

I still think they are going to have a huge share buyback of over 14m shares (their buyback program was increased from 75m to 475m) in stock and add to the insider owned shares which is now at 54.80% over the week it has gone up about 2%. Which is a bullish signal. If 14m shares were bought that would leave about 51m shares to be traded publicly and the insider owned share percentage would go to about 62% which would be a large driving factor in the price going up due to scarcity. Also the buyback would be large enough to trigger a massive buy and I would jizz my pants.",nmnbfw,*UPDATE* Why I still Think EXPI Is Going To $60 In 4-6 Weeks (up 10.59% this week)

Alas, it was, of course, fake, and he was broke and depressed. It might have been the first fatal case of autism.

What he planned on doing with the bees was anyone’s guess, and I doubt he thought it through that much either.

Oh, and the bees were from fucking Myanmar. Handshake agreement, of course. Total Chad move.

And like I said before, the rest went without incident for a while. It would take the bees “a year” to make honey, so he just kinda hung out, stayed busy, and tried to find part time work in a foreign country he arrived in 2.5 months earlier.

And then, the professor ghosted him. Just disappeared. Shortly thereafter, government agents come out about this kid from Oklahoma illegally importing a non-native bee to their country. Apparently his bees had been fucking with other apiaries. So, he did probably the smartest thing he’s ever done.

He ran.

He fucking ran from the Uruguayan government, took a plane to LAX, and arrived with $14 to his name. His friend sent him $100, which wasn’t enough to go back to Oklahoma, so he took a $75 flight to Seattle, where he is also not from.

His last post is from a train out of the airport, with $39 to his name. I don’t know what is in store for him, but I know that $39 is as good as spent on urchin futures or whatever market he’s going to crash up there.

3229,,2021-05-28 03:12:37,t3_nmofz4,,wallstreetbets,"This started as a comment reply but I thought maybe people would like reading it. I've been researching Palantir since literally late November 2020 and I have nearly my entire portfolio in LEAPS expiring January 2023. So I have continually done more research on them this is just the basics to clear up confusion and help people who don't understand it because it's hard to hear all the hype and stuff. Also AMC to the moon tomorrow for my FDs I bought!! Don't judge me it's just fun to be in on the action on weeks like this.


So you should think of palantir as basically three companies and they actually are very far from unprofitable. 

They developed the really massive government software (gotham) specifically as a result of an interaction that happened to Peter Thiel while he was at paypal. They were losing millions to foreign scammers at paypal and the solution ended up being a high quality algorithm that flagged the most likely scam transactions and then allowed analysts to efficiently double check and verify the real scam transactions.

 It essentially was using what computers are efficient at (sorting through massive amounts of data) and then combining that with what humans are good at (looking at the more complex nuances that at least at that point computer algorithms were incapable of doing) and augmenting the humans ability to make complex decisions by rapidly sorting through the incoming data and bringing everything good to their attention.

They fixed paypals using this method and literally made the company profitable overnight because of fixing how much they were losing in the scam transactions. The FBI contacted PayPal and Thiel about using that initial software. That was literally his inspiration for what would become Palantir. He goes over it in huge detail in his book zero to one. If you make an audible account you can read it for free and find the chapter I'm talking about.

Then for 15 years they perfected the government software into the absolute nearly monopoly it is now in government intelligence augmentation software. The whole time though they reinvested almost everything for the last 10 years into building the commercial software (Foundry). That side of the business has only been live for a VERY short time and initially they literally didn't spend a single dollar on marketing their first commercial clients sought THEM out because of their insane reputation with the government. Foundry helps with supply chains and all kinds of other important data  insights. But if you want a recent example the NIH and the NHS both used Foundry to figure out how to best distribute the vaccine and vaccine distribution in the US and Britain has far outpaced expectations. You think commercial companies aren't going to be interested in using the software that was literally proven on a level like that?

 They're only just now adding huge amounts of people to their sales teams literally in the last six months which if you read Peter thiels book is insane for the stock because they have this crazy long term plan and he literally talks about how when they get to a certain point and start adding sales as a full sector of the company it means that is the company the company plans to BEGIN scaling. Meaning they're this big and they literally only just started on the scaling part. Which they've also said in tons of interviews if you're a die hard Palantirian like me. 



They actually also have the third side of the  business which is their actual like full AI for weaponization and war and defense for the government. Gotham is like helping analysts and commanders lead and even helping police or agents figure out what's going on. This other software is different. It's called Apollo and its only at the beginning too. It's like pure AI machine learning AI handles everything stuff. Go find a video called pentagon head of NSC briefs public on AI I think it's on the PBS channel on YouTube or some shit. Or you can listen to Joe Biden talk about how we're going to double our percentage of gdp spending on AI. The amount of government money that's going to go into AI as a weapon to compete with China DWARFS peoples expectations of how much large the market for the kind of software palantir makes is. 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201001005334/en/U.S.-Army-Research-Lab-Selects-Palantir-Technologies-Inc.-for-91M-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-Development

This is literally the backbone of everything AI that the government is about to invest in. Sure they're going to experiment with other research but if you do research you'll also find Palantir is the ONLY company that does anything remotely like this software that has anywhere near the kind of clearances like what is required for these contracts. They are currently a clearance level 5 and about to be the highest 6. The closest competitors are almost all a 3 or lower I'm not even sure if there's more than a single 4 and that stuff is crazy hard to get. 

But like again I'm an obsessive. I realize why people get so excited about the commercial side scaling and how it's very possible and can make them huge and it will. But I'm actually pretty sure the reason people like Cathy Wood has such a huge boner for them is that she realizes how MASSIVELY. And I mean MASSIVELY underestimated the amount of government revenue they will get from all this AI investing the United States and NATO are about to do. It's literally the next Manhattan project and they're absolutely going to be one of the biggest players developing it if not the biggest. I think it's funny because most people are pretty disinterested in the government stuff for Palantir but i really think the weaponized AI apollo stuff may be as big as anything could ever be. 




Also people got the insider selling stuff very very wrong. Tom Nash (love him or hate him I don't care) has a few really good recent videos where he explains it in basically full detail what was happening. The selling panicked a lot of retail investors during a time when the buying for growth markets had really slowed because of rate hike due to inflation scares and a ton of retail holders got scared and caused more selling and more people got scared because of that and sold and it really just was mass psychology in effect and a LOT of FUD and confusion. 

Basically a few executives karp in particular got billions of dollars worth of options that vest but literally expire so you have to exercise them which means you buy shares of the company at a strike price. Well because it's the company granting shares the strike price is literally 10 cents or something and these automatically have to vest at quarterly increments. So everytime karp was exercising he's actually buying shares. Like over 150 million in total maybe a lot more million SHARES not dollars. shares. And even those when he exercising he's buying shares technically from the company it ALL counts as profit on taxes and ITS NOT LONG TERM CAP GAINS ELIGIBLE. So over the last year plus this year he's essentially getting shares but the literal dollar value of those shares to the government counts as pure profit. So his total income which he's getting taxed at 40% of is in the BILLIONS yes billions. Because that's a lot to handle people that work for them actually automatically schedule sells of shares to cover the taxes so that there's no issue it's not even like him saying sell today and they do this.... TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INSIDER SELLING TO THE SEC. That's why it's automatically happening so no one can ever claim he's timing it. 

So listen cause here's where it gets important. The exercising of the shares counts as almost pure profits but remember he's receiving SHARES not dollars he doesn't actually get billions of dollars. So has to then sell SOME of the shares so he can pays taxes on that. Then when he sells the shares to pay the taxes for exercising he actually owes even more money if they went up from when he exercised. So everytime he's selling low its actually good for him because it's less ADDITIONAL PROFIT that he would owe taxes on.

 If he wasn't selling its because he thought it would go down even further and then he would actually owe less taxes overall. So if he thought it was going to tank he'd wait and actually get a nice fat discount on his taxes. 

I know this seems really crazy but I promise that's how it works you can look it up in detail but yeah shocking that mainstream media and redditors/youtubers who barely do research and have no real understanding of how these billion dollar compensations work would get it wrong. Unbelievable I know. If he had actually sold the massive overall percentage of his shares that some people claim he did the company would be at like $3-6 dollars not low 20s. Retail got confused because of market pressured due to interest rate fears from inflation and sold low (like retail always does) to institutions.",nmofz4,"Palantir DD if you want to understand company and it's history better (also insider ""selling"" explained in detail)"

What is Blue Apron?


Blue Apron (NYSE: APRN) was the forgotten step child, bad luck Brian, IPO of summer 2017 that priced below range and had the misfortune of debuting after Amazon bought Whole Foods. Since it’s debut, the stock has suffered dropping from nearly $150 per share (adjusted for a 2019 reverse-split necessitated to stay listed) to as low as approximately $2.00!


Why the Drop?


Management. Fucking. Sucked. The prior executive team essentially handed Chad Hello Fresh the keys to the kingdom, when they made the fatal error of betting that the “high affinity core users” would be enough to sustain the business. For this reason, they cut marketing to nearly nothing and attempted to realize operating leverage by shrinking the customer base only to its most prolific buyers.

This was stupid. HelloFresh did the opposite, essentially giving away meals, and they used it to stockpile market share. Put a chart up of HelloFresh customers against Blue Apron. You’ll see the two lines converge and a clear indication that HelloFresh stole most of their business. HelloFresh was one of the best trades of the past 5 years. Look at the chart, look at the sales, and look at the margins. They have managed to achieve operating leverage by employing affordable pricing and emphasizing retention.


Blue Apron Might Go Under....


Today the company is in a dire place. Languishing away in Micro Cap hell at an $80M market cap, no one on Wall Street wants to cover these guys. Only their bankers, CG and MS, write them research and neither are overly optimistic. They’re in a shit spot with a credit line that mandates they keep $15M cash at all times, and they keep their customer base above 300K (thus far, they’ve struggled). They’re sitting on $29M and burn enough cash per Q that they might go below that $15M level (wouldn’t be a first). All signs are negative...


But I Think They Might Win


Blue Apron is under new management. Linda Kozlowski, is the former COO of ETSY and an ex-strategist at Alibaba. She believes HelloFresh did things right and she wants to right the ship. Her ballsy-ass plan is to ride the line on cash and go all in on customer growth. She realizes those customers are worth a lot more than income on the P&L, and that she needs to make the pot as big as she can. Thus far, it’s worked. Customers are up over 20% in the past two periods and retention rates are rising. We are seeing signs of operating leverage, and it opens a big possibility.


My Prediction

Management is buying shares. They know the company is not healthy. The only logic is that they have a plan that’s working. You can’t sell a dying business with a shrinking share, but you can certainly sell a growing community, that could be an accretive asset to a better capitalized entity. I think Linda is going either get the business in a position where it can refinance for better terms, or where it can be sold to create shareholder value via a strategic alternative.

If that happen, given this is priced for bankruptcy and ignored by the Street, the returns could easily reach the triple digits. I’m long and I plan to add on additional weakness.

Disclosure- I’m buying a stock that might go under. This is not advice! I’m stupid.",nmoit0,Blue Apron: Hero or Zero

Everyone is talking about how the squeeze didn't even happen and the shorts didn't cover yet. What I don't understand is why wouldn't that be possible? If short interest is 17%, so let's round up to about 100M shares. Today the volume traded was 700M shares. Couldn't 100M of those 700M have been the shorts covering? And if they didn't cover, today alone 700M shares were traded, why would 100M shares bought by shorts cause a squeeze if today 700M were traded?

I have been having this question for awhile, since I noticed the same with GME. In the days preceding January 28th (when GME reached its peak), the combined volume was several times the amount of float. How come the squeeze happened and why did it happen? If the volume was so high, couldn't the shorts have covered in the days preceding that?

Everything looked to have gone off successfully. We are now waiting on the data and craft to be analysed and inspected. This will take a few weeks according to Michael Colglazier.

1st test flight - may 
2nd crewed flight - June 
3rd flight with R Branson on board late June/July 

4th flight this will be taking the Italian airforce on a training mission (600k a seat) late July


On the run in to the first test flight some possible maintenance issues appeared with the carrier plane White knight 2…. 
This indeed could have gone either way , after 2 weeks inspections it was decided that WK2 did not need to delay testing no maintenance was needed at this point. Scheduled Maintenance will commence in the fall after all tests have been completed.
Upon this news it is my opinion that the testing programme will go ahead as planned.

The market has responded accordingly and the stock is now up from $17-€31

The plan includes creating an online ticketing platform by Great British Railways which might have a huge blow on Trainline revenue. However, this platform does not yet exist and will probably take a couple of years to develop. Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed.

In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales.  Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%.  

I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time  for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

Basically, this is the best ganja plant company on planet Earth and is undervalued af trading at 1.4x consensus rates compared to a trash peer group trading at 8x that on average. They are projected to have 115 stores EOY in Canada. They bought out FABCBD in the US and operate the largest E-Commerce platforms for cannabis in the world. Many of you have probably heard of GrassCity, CBDCity, and Smoke Cartel (they own these). They have celebrity licensing with Snoop and others and thousands of SKUs. They have a super clean balance sheet and positive adjusted EBITDA. They are cash positive and vertically integrated and scaling massively YOY with a dynamic team in place. They have plans to expand world-wide and make great deals and acquisitions monthly. This is truly the best weed play on the entire market with tremendous upside. They just got approved to trade on the NASDAQ as well. It is currently trading at around $8. Personal PT EOY is $50. I can easily see this at $500 in 6 years or so. You have no idea what is happening with this company. Do your research as I am not a financial advisor. I own 420 shares. I will answer any and all questions my fellow apes have.

3272,,2021-05-28 10:41:01,t3_nmuzzi,,wallstreetbets,"Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent of Moderna which their market cap which will put share price at $800 to $1000. Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variants so as time goes on,and variants get worse and other vaccines get more ineffective ...protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length Spike protein versus a piece of the spike protein. This allows for the body to remember a larger picture of the virus therefore recognize other forms of variants easier. It's the most effective type of vaccine for covid. 

So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines so other protein competitors will be far behind and they will have an a moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing they teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine. They will be combining flu and covid vaccine by 2025 for possibly double the price of current covid vaccine.

 They are pretty much de-risked at this point. Yes you could buy other  biotechs that can go up 20x but are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that has all successful trials done so far successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development. They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment to where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place there are no more glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""

They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio. Yesterday at close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close representing about 80% of the trading volume in 5 minutes. Hedges are repositioning towards long and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

Chart on DD is in link below in another message. It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $600 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip the in mid June when P3 results come out and anticipation grows for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot securing you a decent profit on options. 

I own 138 $250 July calls along with about 1k shares. I'm all in baby. LFG I expect to turn 200k into over a million on a year's time via shares and options",nmuzzi,"Nvax DD (low float, hight short ratio, 7x future returns along with 6 -10+ billion in revanie for 2022)"

3281,,2021-05-28 11:40:22,t3_nmvyvq,,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been in AMC since January and WSB since February along with GME so here’s some advice for the newbies and people who believed the FUD that “meme stocks” will never rise again, short interest is only 20%, AMC will never hit $20, $30, etc. GME is only worth $20, the squeeze already happened, etc....

The squeeze started before today. It’s already been “squeezing” for a bit. This squeeze is a bit more controlled than January, but it’s still overall following the same trend. 

Hedge funds were playing a game of chicken to see who bails first. Some bailed, others doubled down on shorts (as late as yesterday) because they believed their own FUD that these stocks can never rise again. Others, just didn’t want to lose to the poor or disadvantaged or people shoving crayons and bananas in their orifices. Look up glacier capitals shareholder letter for a good look at the mindset of these hedge funds (it personally made me more bullish Wednesday and I’m glad someone posted it in a different sub). 

They increased their shorts, long story, short earlier this week. 

So, what does this mean? No one really knows what they are talking about. I certainly don’t know. No one here can predict the future, or really know what’s going on behind the scenes... It’s all guesses. BUT, we can make bets on possible outcomes. It bothered me how people pushed their opinions as facts, so I am not going to do the same. I don’t know what the future holds either. I’m just guessing based off what is happening now. Honestly, ignore those who think they “know” the answers. If they did, they would be rich already. Don’t take financial advice from people who are as poor as you, or poorer. I made 45k$ with 5 calls and $5k during the March squeeze. I am not rich and I don’t know what I’m doing, but I believe the gamma squeeze is imminent. If you want to believe with me, go ahead. Let’s get these tendies together. If you don’t know the ceiling or are afraid to take that leap, buy puts once it hits that all time high that those banana and crayon loving apes have been waiting for. I’m personally doing both. 

Also, please, prepare for the January bullsh!+

Stock freezes, trading halts, blocked access to buying and selling more shares, constant FUD spam, banning of live updates on gme. It’s all designed to cause a panic and stop the gamma. It worked last time, so if it ain’t broke don’t fix it. This scenario will play out for certain if we see a $100-$200 jump on gme in a single day. All “meme stocks” will be frozen or halted too. If it remains a controlled squeeze this will be postponed till next week or a later date. Still, be armed and ready because anything is possible. 

Tl;dr 

Is it too late to get in? Not really

Gme or amc? If you can afford it; both. Low budget? AMC. Higher budget; GME. 

AMC will pop first maybe so you could jump in on that if want tendies now though. 

Options or shares: Depends on budget. Ideally both. Sell calls buy shares. Buy puts when it falls back to earth. 

How far can it go? No one really knows. When the trading freezes start and panic sets in, anything can happen. Just keep calm and remember this is still only part 2 of the gamma. Part 3 will be the most epic spectacle in history :)

What is your play? I’m selling my calls before 2 pm and spreading my gains out into calls for next week and end of July. I’m buying puts as well when I identify the “limit” of high these stocks will go today. If this really is a controlled squeeze, it will continue into next week and push even higher. I’m just waiting for the moment the panic selling starts really. 

Who are you? Just a guy who learned options 2 months ago and wants to be a billionaire for personal reasons. 

Is any of this true? It’s just an opinion and advice. 

Will you help me learn this stuff? I don’t have the time. I wish I could but I have other businesses to run. Just try to learn something from this post and ask around. There are other apes who would be happy to help.

This is just an opinion, not financial advice. 

I wish you all the best of luck. It’s going to be a war zone in Season 2",nmvyvq,Just some advice

GME is transitioning from retail to e-commerce and theyve just announced a NFT based project that's likely going to be used to enable transferring ownership of digital games, opening a new market!

GME on fundamentals alone has the chance to go to $750 a share (or 50 bil valuation).

GME has a higher short interest, an all-star team board of directors, a bright future, the saga of DFV, Ryan Cohen.

Citadel is long on AMC

GME is debt free, and has close to 750 million cash whereas AMC is heavily in debt

AMCs CEO is heavily connected to Wallstreet

AMC has diluted their shares heavily.

They want to hit people’s sell limits and cause a snowball effect of limits hitting causing new/lower sell limits to be reached.

Bet on server (preferably the better player, but if they’re evenly matched it has a high success rate too) to win the first point and double/triple down until he wins a point.

If the server is -190 or stronger odds, it requires a triple down to profit. If they are under -150 double down usually is fine

GME is transitioning from retail to e-commerce and theyve just announced a NFT based project that's likely going to be used to enable transferring ownership of digital games, opening a new market!

GME on fundamentals alone has the chance to go to $750 a share (or 50 bil valuation).

GME has a higher short interest, an all-star team board of directors, a bright future, the saga of DFV, Ryan Cohen.

Citadel is long on AMC

GME is debt free, and has close to 750 million cash whereas AMC is heavily in debt

AMCs CEO is heavily connected to Wallstreet

AMC has diluted their shares heavily.

Shorting I do believe is ultimately driving down the price of a stock often using borrowed shares and FUD allowing you to profit with puts (another options strategy). 

Calls are bets that the stock will hit your strike price, giving you the option to buy 100 shares at your strike price. 

Example: I bought gme 200$ strike calls and gme is trading at 260 and climbing. I have the right to buy 100 shares of gme at $200 each, giving me a profit of $6000 and climbing. Options expire as well while shares don’t so it’s risky but the rewards are higher. Honestly if you can buy a lot of shares, do that. If you are poor like me options are a great way to get similar gains as you. You do run the risk of losing what you put in though.",,

Their pipeline has shown tremendous potential in combination therapies for a variety of cancers including breast and fatal skin cancers for people with MDS.

This is all after a Guggenheimer analyst recently upgraded from .61c to $4.00 was overshadowed by a 1:15 reverse split to maintain exchange compliance rules. Stock plummeted afterwards and short interest is holding small dedicated folks who believe in the company holding the bag.

Updated analyst targets after the split put the stock between $31.50 and $60.

In 18 months they'll creep back up (3-4-5%) and not only will nobody be refinancing, people will be chained to their houses with golden, unassumable mortgages. If you bought a $300k house at 2.5% and you decide you need something different but the rates have moved up to 5%, you'd have to find a house worth $220k or less in order to have the same payment. 

Once this boom is over, I think we're going to see most of the US housing prices roll over into a 5-15% recessed value with a very flat valuation for 6-10 years. You'll be able to move, but it will cost you a lot more every month so there will be fewer people ""moving up"". The prices won't appreciate nearly as fast, so your equity will stagnate. It won't be enough to break the banks - the people they're lending to can cover the payments - and nobody is going to panic sell or default so the lending insurance market will chug along (and possibly do better as more people will be stuck with PMI for longer). But the whole loan side of the industry is going to be in a malaise until 2028-2030.",,

https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/maintain-short-position-delisted-stock/
A company doesn’t go bankrupt JUST because of short selling, but short sellers(large firms not everyday retail) have a damn good reason to make shareholders continue to sell off, ultimately hurting the company via stock price. Then the short sellers have no shares to buy back. Free money basically. 
As seen with GME and AMC, shareholders investing in a company can bring them out of debt and completely turn a business around. Now the massive firms betting on their demise have become opposite bag holders and want this stock to fail. 

How’s that for a brain dead take?

Regulations are being put into place as we speak by officials. You think I, a nobody, have any say in a financial system that has been taking advantage of stocks for decades? Firms have been fined millions of dollars and it’s nothing compared to the billions they make. 
And I am doing what I can by holding these stocks and helping my new found friends fight back. 

I’d say anyone taking the time to discuss their opinion on an open forum cares enough to be heard. I’m listening, and I’d love to hear a real reason as to why you oppose this. If millions of people lose money, what’s it to you? People, collectively, lost more than that last year.",,

Everybody starts somewhere. The stars look good. Just remember that you have to sell that call or have the $3000 to exercise it and buy the stock at the end of the day (and you need to tell your broker to do so). 

Me? If I had a $30c? I'd ride that SOB as hard as possible today and then cash it out mid-afternoon and buy a 7/2 put with half the winnings at about $5-7 below the current strike, or wherever the gamma tails off. 

Note: I will be downvoted for cutting against the surge, but this will be a bubble and it will pop. That's not saying AMC isn't a good play long term (tho I'm not a theater fan, personally), but in 24 months I would expect the value to be in the $20-24 range, tops, unless there's a substantial shift in their business model.

The EMA (European FDA) is briefing today at 9am EST, but not sure if deal will be announced today. There's a steady steady stream of catalysts coming, and 48 new tuties opens positions this last 3 weeks. A lot going on for this stock. 

Approval getting pushed back 6 weeks if not a big deal theres too much demand for the next 4 years for covid vaccines. Either way they're still producing vaccines as we speak versus Pfizer and moderna that started producing after they got approval and it took him awhile to get stockpile ready before they could give out vaccines so regardless time wise it's going to be basically the same in that regard because their stockpiling before approval so when approval comes they can hit the ground running versus when your competitors got approved they start to stumbling out the gate with manufacturing huge difference

I'll be trying to get out of the June $20 without a loss sometime in the next week or two. Other June and the July stuff I'm gonna ride for a bit and try and get some money. On the following pull back / consolidation phase I'll buy calls for the next leg.

**DD and back story -**

**The Good**

We'll get to that part in a bit

**The bad**

The history: GE was a massive company, has been around forever and was known as one of the quintessential American companies. They became this massive conglomerate that bought up companies left and right leading up to the mortgage backed securities bonanza in the mid 2000's. Not sure I'll need to remind everyone what happened at the end of that (Rhymed with Semen Mothers) but GE took it particularly bad. See after the 2008 / 2009 meltdown it turned out that not only had they lost a ton of money on derivatives and other financial products but (as would become public later) they lied to investors about it on disclosures and jumped through hoops to keep investors from finding out just how bad the situation was. Add to that some really badly timed all cash acquisitions that worked out terribly and the company was about ready to go belly up.

**The Ugly**

There is a reason that while the whole world got its act back together after 2009, GE continued to play act a paraplegic thrown in the deep end of a pool. The stock took beating after beating as news kept coming out about acquisitions that went bad (massive write downs), accounting fraud and various other losses. After getting rid of their CEO they brought in someone else to try and turn things around, then after a very short run they replaced that guy with the current CEO Larry Culp. They basically had to bribe / beg him to take the job, getting him to leave a cushy gig at Harvard where he was basically in working retirement after having earned a reputation as a corporate turn around guru.

**Making our way back to the good**

While GE's stock continued to flounder Culp got busy and started to shake things up. First he started selling divisions and companies. Some of them had been with GE forever, like the lightbulb divisions, others were acquisitions (some of which only a few years old) that were sold off. This wasn't about profiting by spinning something off - it was about cutting losses and making sense out of a massive company that didn't have a functioning balance sheet. Some of the chunks that were sold were profitable and many were not. The net effect was that he cut operating expenses more than he cut operating revenue, moving free cash flow (FCF) in the right direction (albeit still negative at this point) and raising cash from the sales.

They slashed the dividend to 1 penny. People were clutching their pearls and screaming! I mean... It was GE for Pete's sake. They've had a good dividend forEVER! This dragged the stock down more. But it shoved FCF in the right direction.

Between significantly improved FCF and money raised from selling off divisions and assets GE managed to cut its TOTAL debt from $130 BILLION to $71 BILLION (which is about where it is right now, although they do have more than $25 billion cash on hand). Oh yeah they also own 25% of Baker Hughes (valued at about $6.5 billion, that is after they sold $1 billion worth of it recently), they are also selling GECAS (airline leasing company that owned airliners and rented them out to airlines and other companies) to the global leader in the space. In return for shedding this division, which due to structural issues and insufficient scale to create real efficiencies, was losing GE $700 million a year in FCF, GE is getting $24 billion in cash, $1 billion in cash equivalents and $6 billion worth of a company (45% of the company's stock) that happens to be beaten up at the moment but is the world's largest airline leasing company and is about to have a gang buster year as airlines struggle to find planes. Could easily see the value of that swelling and then them dumping it to pay down even more debt.

**The Good - you may have to squint but it is there. I swear**

GE is now a rather lean company, especially compared to the mess that existed 5 years ago. I've given you the current cash / debt position. From that alone, doesn't seem great but I do ask that you keep in mind the trend line, from $130BB to $71BB over 5 years.

Today GE is made up of 4 divisions (they no longer make home appliances, it isn't one of the divisions. yes I know, they still are on the market but the stuff sold under the GE name in home appliances is by actually made by the Haier conglomerate and.... never mind):

**HealthCare** \- Not sure if any of you have had an MRI but if you had you may have had the same weird experience I did. Walking into the room, kind of nervous to get this big medical test to find out what is wrong with my ::Insert body party here:: and being confronted with the biggest GE logo I have EVER seen. Embossed into the side of this MRI machine. Anyway, whether you were aware of it or not GE makes a lot of tech for healthcare. from MRI machines to ultrasounds and tons of other stuff. It is a growing business that is consistently profitable and ***something*** *:: cough cough COVID knocked us on our butt and hospitals need to retool and get better::* tells me that healthcare spending is going to be rising a lot this year and next year.

**Energy -** Basically this is about steam turbines used for 20th century electricity generation (and storage in some cases). Talking huge turbines used in natural gas, oil, coal, nuclear and geothermal power plants (I think GE itself may consider Hydro power plant turbines part of this sector but I'm listing them below because that makes more sense). While not very forward looking this business has the potential to generate significant FCF over the next few years maybe even a decade or more. While some of these power sources are on their way out others (like natural gas) have seen a surge in utilization and some (nuclear) seem to be about to make a comeback. This chunk of GE is usually profitable, although not hugely so. That being said, between what happened in Texas which will require several power plants to be overhauled or replaced, existing service and new equipment contracts and the potential to grow, I think this is a worthwhile business unit to keep around.

**Renewable Energy -** Some solar, a decent amount of hydro power, a growing pumped storage segment and WIND TURBINES. These electrical generators (and in the case of pumped storage - mechanical batteries) are one of the most exciting areas for me personally when looking at the GE story. GE briefly snagged the title as producing the world's largest wind turbine (14 MW) and it is the largest one that many countries have certified for use. This thing is bonkers, every rotation of the blades produces enough electricity to power roughly 4,000 homes for a DAY. It is a monster and it has been selected for use in the next phase of the world's largest offshore wind farm and the first phase of the US' first large offshore windfarm. GE also makes onshore wind turbines, they make the truly massive turbines used in huge hydro electric damns and they also make turbines for use in pumped storage\*. This segment has up till now been generation negative FCF (losing money) however it is growing by leaps and bounds and seems poised to start adding to positive FCF a little this year or next and then growing exponentially.

\*Pumped storage is really cool. Basically you create a large body of water (like a lake) by using excess electricity made by solar and wind when it is available to pump water up hill. Then, when you need more electricity because it is night time or the wind isn't blowing you throw the turbine in reverse and it acts as a hydro electric damn.

**Aviation** \- This is the crown jewel of GE although in a weird twist of fait it delivered a kick to the nuts just as things started turning around. Needless to go into much detail as to why a business that makes its money building and servicing jet engines might be negatively effected when air travel takes a year and a half pause. That being said GE's newest engines are showing a great track record of winning orders. Doing this DD I found out that apparently when you buy commercial airliners you get to pick what engines you want (if there are more than one option) kind of like when you buy a car and pick whether you want the in dash CD player or not. GE's engines are proving to be more efficient, more reliable and cheaper to operate than their main competitor Pratt and Whitney. That means that as everyone gets waxed and vaxed in preparation for the horney party boom we are about to witness airlines have started ordering planes again and in a big way. You see, during the covid crisis airlines didn't have many customers and what most of them did was they identified their oldest and/or most problematic aircraft and sold them off various other companies in other industries or to companies that lease aircraft to airlines when they need a few to fill a gap. Now that things are coming back online airlines are ordering more planes. As other parts of the world start to open up over time this should create sustained tail winds for this division.

Oh yeah and one thing that often seems to be overlooked is that while yes, the aviation division has been beat up, management has used this as an opportunity to streamline and improve operations. Both sales and maintenance saw significant drops in revenue however the drop in FCF was smaller than would be expected because the whole time GE was improving its margins. Now as their order book starts filling up the aviation division is significantly leaner and more optimized which should mean that when the FCF starts up again this fall or this winter it should turn into a firehose.

**Other points of interest**

GE has announced a 1 for 8 stock split (that is a reverse split, for every 8 shares you own you will end up with 1 share that is worth 8X the pre split value). This makes sense for a few reasons.

1. GE has a massive number of shares outstanding and doing this reverse split will bring its stock price (adjusted for market cap) within line with its piers and should put it in a position to re-enter the DOW. Doing so will create demand for the shares as it is added to funds that track that index.
2. Once GE reinstates its dividend (which will be another catalyst for the stock to continue upwards) the lower share count means a slower drain on FCF since I imagine they will incrementally increase the dividend. It seems silly because it doesn't really matter how many shares except when you consider that they have so many that if you decide to go from a dividend of $0.01 to $0.10 the difference in share float would be hundreds of millions annualized in FCF. Obviously the target yield wouldn't be impacted but even this small thing can have a real impact in speeding up the debt reduction.
3. I fully expect that as the stock price increases and then the reverse split happens GE will do a share issuance to raise a few billion to pay down the debt. I view that as a buying opportunity as any drop in share price should be short lived and I expect the resulting reduction in debt will mean net / net share prices will increase due to the issuance.

On that note GE has committed to a stated target of 2.5 times EBITDA (which is the cutoff for investment grade securities) from the current 6 times EBITDA. Getting to investment grade will create increased upside pressure, that is why I'm saying the stock will go up when they issue more shares (even though there will likely be a temporary dip at that time).",nmkhyz,GE - a bull Thesis (F off haters - Imma go 🚀🚀🚀🚀 to the MOON)

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote...

and balking at even a penny of additional liquidity. How the Fed will continue to monetize debt then, when the repo system is now out of collateral, is anyone's guess.

By mid-July, we’ll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase higher yields in the FX swap market amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative

Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks.

Consider this also . Annual mining output is roughly 800-1000 million ounces of silver a year. They use around those numbers as well 900M a year. It's a very tight market. 330 million americans. Say 10% of americans buy 100oz physical. 28usd x 100 = 2800USD quite affordable.. 10% of 330 million = 33 million 33 million x 100oz  330 million ounces off the market. That is a big supply shortage not counting in the domino effect.........


Silver rose 35 x in the 1970s,Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. When inflation hit 3.5 silver hit 50 in 2011 . Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms.

As a ticket here I prefer PSLV, but all ETFs essentially share the same traits in that you can invest extremely large sums of money with them and it is highly liquid to get in and out of. Only the whale investors can actually take physical out, but if they are taking it out, it’s not to bring home 1,000 oz bars to use as doorstops, but probably to transfer to a vault of their choosing. These will generally move with the price of the underlying metal. Some of these ETFs  like slv  you can buy call options with, which can provide you some upside leverage. However, the idea here is to park large sums of money through your brokerage with them to realize gains over a long term. The one major downside most of these have is you are giving your money to the trust, and the trust owns the metal not you and mostly those trusts are not favored to metal price spike .",nmkmcq,"Rrp explosion , inflation spike and results for precious metal"

so a bit of a preface, i'm pretty new to investing, but one thing i do know is science, so hear me out.

Tesla is known as a good long term investment because of the fact that eventually we are all going to need electric cars in hope to reduce our carbon emissions as low as possible, meaning the abandonment of the internal combustion engine... or does it? recently in the past few years there have been a lot of study's released proving that synthetic fuel or fuel basically made of of hydrogen with renewable energy like wind power is actually as carbon neutral as electric engines, i think this is dooming to tesla for a few reasons.

1. synthetic fuel is MUCH more convenient then electric. synthetic fuel is able to work in the internal combustion engine which means that people wouldn't have to replace their cars. the base model of the cheapest tesla is 35,000 dollars USD which a lot of family's(including mine) can't afford to spend on a new car, especially if our current one is working. so that's thousands of cars being left in the dust while they can be used and have a neutral carbon footprint.
2. tesla problems. from what i have heard tesla's are built like sh#t, low quality and poor assembly make them prone to needing repairs, which normal car mechanics are not equipped or trained to deal with because of the obvious. also tesla's are extremely heavy, i don't really care about that but apparently that's a huge turn off for others.
3. other industry's. so tesla and other electric car company's make electric cars, not planes or boats, so that means that those to major contributors are left out to still release a lot of co2. with synthetic fuel they can switch alongside cars making it better in that sense.
4. car fans. so i know a lot of car enthusiasts who, all hate tesla's and wouldn't buy one if they had to. they would much rather stick to their cars like Lamborghini's and other old cars that would get left out with electric cars but would still be as usable synthetic, and considering the amount of car enthusiasts in the world and how much they affect the auto market i don't see it panning out there.
5. timing. so no matter what number you agree on for how long it's going to take to switch completely electric it's stupid. so like i said earlier the majority of family's can't just drop thirty five k on a new car meaning it would take awhile to be able to get everyone electric plus the time and money it would take to build up the infrastructure to switch electric but considering that synthetic fuel uses the same stuff as petrol it would be much easier to keep going synthetic.
6. back on the subject of time, i saw a study saying we could switch completely synthetic by 2024 if we tried. whomever if you look at electric you see company's like GM saying they will have 50 new electric MODELS by 2050, do we really have that time? science say's no.

so if you take these reasons ( and they are not all, i have a few more ) into consideration tesla now might be a good stock with nice returns but now that synthetics are becoming more and more possible i am starting to think they might actually be our future. like i said I'm pretty new and relatively dumb on the mentality of other investors please leave your opinion below.",nml65m,Tesla might be a bad future investment.

Palantir Options are dirt cheap and there is a lot of eyes on it now. Call options with 100+ day expiry and within $1 of strike are selling for less than $2 per contract. Lots of analysts very bullish on this stock. As always do your own DD.

See you at the top boys.

Position: $40c June 17 '22

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Palantir will MOON soon. Get on board before we take off.

1. The company itself, Palantir; one of the only 2 **unicorn** startups to emerge from the defense sector, focused on national security, alongside SpaceX.

A real company that has built its product for **18 years**, & **PROVEN** its products on national level (UK Vaccination), US ARMY , NAVY and soon AIRFORCE, (BP) OIL&GAS Sector, Law Agency, Mining sector (rio tinto), IBM cloud, etc.

2) There were news of Palantir's Enterprise Resource Planning system with Amazon's cloud service platform Amazon Web Services, making it available to all AWS customers. AND PROVEN to be so value-adding, BP used it and saved 50 million in working capital within 2 weeks of installation, with the potential to do more if applied across their worldwide supply chain. The ERP suite can be deployed within days for all AWS customer. This is HUGE , and DOWNPLAYED last friday because of all the market shits that have been going on.

3) I would also say a lot other recent PLTR news have been downplayed, and PLTR always doesn't make a huge marketing about their announcements, like Karp has said, they believe in the long term, the value of PLTR would reveal itself.

4) The insider selloff has made the company undervalued. Remember when insiders were selling their 20% shares in direct listing at $7.50? How undervalued they were before people including Cathie Wood/ArkInvest started to realize and it rose to $27 within a month? You can take advantage of the insiders' selloffs of their long term held shares, infact, i think they are done (a lot were sold initially, but no selloff for last week) and we are going to the fking moon.

5) All the paperhands' shares and insiders' shares are going to diamond hands like Cathie Wood, who are going to hold for years. I see Cathie Wood buying PLTR like TSLA, don't forget Cathie Wood bought TSLA in 2018 (that's some insane gains), and she is the god among all fund managers when it comes to spotting a disruptive/growth stock, she literally does this for a living and got famed as the best investor now at the age of 65.

6) Cathie Wood just keep buying PLTR with 2 ARK funds, owns over 1% of Palantir, and she's not done yet. She bought at $30, $25, every $23.You are literally getting an insurance that Cathie wood would save your ass IF the stock goes under.

7) It's literally inevitable for PLTR to get more contracts and increase its revenue and growth... also not forgetting the stickiness of the contracts and business, it's hard to forgo the product after u have integrated it into your business.

8) In this Era of Big Data, PLTR is literally the leader in the dominating industry of the near future, which company/service is not going to use the best Data Analytics software in the future or even now?

9) Proven Track Record of HUGE Growth and credibility , proven 42% revenue growth YoY, expected 45% for next quarter, AT LEAST 30% for next 5 years, words of Karp. Last Year, Karp said at least 30% for YoY and he did 42% YoY like a boss.

10) Don't forget we got a $34 Price Target from Goldman Sachs after the earnings

11) If investors are justifying growth stocks' value with growth, I see Palantir time and time proven overperformed growth rate as the most bullish factor. Also, its cost is going to drive down because the main costs are from employee stock options now, which will expire in the future. And the accumulation of sticky contracts, it's also easier to maintain/update software installation than installing the software initially in new companies. It also has a huge monopoly in the fast growing industry. (added point from replying a comment)

12) It's ok that the some retards don't join us now, because they will eventually join us in the future, they always join after the rocket is halfway to the moon, they always do. And when that happens, we will still welcome them.",nmlb2d,Palantir Options - DIRT CHEAP

If 14m shares were bought that would leave about 51m shares to be traded publicly and the insider owned share percentage would go to about 62% which would be a large driving factor in the price going up due to scarcity.

[When we last left our hero,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrly28/the_legend_of_utheemperorofjenks_aka_ornamental/) he had just lost all of his rent money and what he could advance from credit cards on a failed Super Bowl bet, and a YOLO on “Rhodium” that he ordered from a sketchy Slovakian Wish.com ripoff. Alas, it was, of course, fake, and he was broke and depressed. It might have been the first fatal case of autism. He thought to himself “Am I really that retarded?” Then, he realized “No, it must be Oklahoma that’s retarded!”

So, [after a brief case of violent diarrhea from Oklahoma Grocery Store sushi](https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/lrslbb/psa_do_not_eat_grocery_store_sushi_right_now/), he was ready to hatch his plan! Uruguay! Yes, Uruguay. [He was going to move to Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lh5igx/c%C3%B3mo_se_puede_llegar_a_melo_desde_montevideo_sin/)

His plans for this move could’ve been anyone’s guess. One possibility he inquired about was [how to be a Tea Blendmaster.](https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/lfga0m/how_does_one_become_a_blendmaster/) [Another was him possibly reconnecting with God.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/lsij6j/agnostic_jew_seeking_faith_in_god/) Yet, he seemed to be asking questions about another topic more often than the others...

[Bees.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lxcnt1/c%C3%B3mo_es_la_legalidad_de_la_apicultura_informal/)

Specifically, beekeeping, a topic he admitted he had no experience in, [as evident from him looking for any book on the subject as an introduction months before.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/)

What he planned on doing with the bees was anyone’s guess, and I doubt he thought it through that much either. One post **AFTER** he took possession of 200,000 bees (we’ll get to that later,) was [asking Americans if there was a demand for mead in the states.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/) So, was he thinking of importing Uruguayan honey to the US to be made into mead? Was he going to make it himself? Did he move to another continent for no reason? Let’s all find out!

A little more than 2 months ago, he finally did it. [He moved to Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/m9ejpn/la_paloma/) And about a week after that, [he was driving a truck filled with 200k bees across his new country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/) Based on replies in that thread, he was aiming to have [a monopoly on beekeeping in the country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/gt48gke/) 

And for a while, things were kind ok for our young Autist. [He picked up his hives without complication.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mtkkf3/about_to_upsize_my_apiary_whats_the_best_layout/) [And then he settled into Melo, Uruguay, and set up his apiary ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/n1jnte/my_humble_apiary_near_melo_uruguay/). Life was good.

But, trouble was afoot. According to a reply, [the species he was planning on keeping had literally never been kept by keepers in Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mtkkf3/about_to_upsize_my_apiary_whats_the_best_layout/gv0viej/) And then, disaster struck. [He went to TIFU to post his tale of spreading an invasive species in an industry he knew nothing about.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/nmd69k/tifu_by_importing_bees_to_uruguay/)

Indeed, he had no idea even what a bee was until he stumbled his way through a book, and then decided to YOLO into honey in Uruguay. He somehow got in touch with an ecology professor in Montevideo that would help him set things up in exchange for grad students fucking with them every now and again. Oh, and the bees were from fucking Myanmar. Handshake agreement, of course. Total Chad move.

And like I said before, the rest went without incident for a while. It would take the bees “a year” to make honey, so he just kinda hung out, stayed busy, and tried to find part time work in a foreign country he arrived in 2.5 months earlier.

And then, the professor ghosted him. Just disappeared. Shortly thereafter, government agents come out about this kid from Oklahoma illegally importing a non-native bee to their country. Apparently his bees had been fucking with other apiaries. So, he did probably the smartest thing he’s ever done.

He ran.

He fucking ran from the Uruguayan government, took a plane to LAX, and arrived with $14 to his name. His friend sent him $100, which wasn’t enough to go back to Oklahoma, so he took a $75 flight to Seattle, where he is also not from.

His last post is from a train out of the airport, with $39 to his name. I don’t know what is in store for him, but I know that $39 is as good as spent on urchin futures or whatever market he’s going to crash up there.

5765,,2021-05-28 03:12:37,t3_nmofz4,,wallstreetbets,"This started as a comment reply but I thought maybe people would like reading it. I've been researching Palantir since literally late November 2020 and I have nearly my entire portfolio in LEAPS expiring January 2023. So I have continually done more research on them this is just the basics to clear up confusion and help people who don't understand it because it's hard to hear all the hype and stuff. Also AMC to the moon tomorrow for my FDs I bought!! Don't judge me it's just fun to be in on the action on weeks like this.


So you should think of palantir as basically three companies and they actually are very far from unprofitable. 

They developed the really massive government software (gotham) specifically as a result of an interaction that happened to Peter Thiel while he was at paypal. They were losing millions to foreign scammers at paypal and the solution ended up being a high quality algorithm that flagged the most likely scam transactions and then allowed analysts to efficiently double check and verify the real scam transactions.

 It essentially was using what computers are efficient at (sorting through massive amounts of data) and then combining that with what humans are good at (looking at the more complex nuances that at least at that point computer algorithms were incapable of doing) and augmenting the humans ability to make complex decisions by rapidly sorting through the incoming data and bringing everything good to their attention.

They fixed paypals using this method and literally made the company profitable overnight because of fixing how much they were losing in the scam transactions. The FBI contacted PayPal and Thiel about using that initial software. That was literally his inspiration for what would become Palantir. He goes over it in huge detail in his book zero to one. If you make an audible account you can read it for free and find the chapter I'm talking about.

Then for 15 years they perfected the government software into the absolute nearly monopoly it is now in government intelligence augmentation software. The whole time though they reinvested almost everything for the last 10 years into building the commercial software (Foundry). That side of the business has only been live for a VERY short time and initially they literally didn't spend a single dollar on marketing their first commercial clients sought THEM out because of their insane reputation with the government. Foundry helps with supply chains and all kinds of other important data  insights. But if you want a recent example the NIH and the NHS both used Foundry to figure out how to best distribute the vaccine and vaccine distribution in the US and Britain has far outpaced expectations. You think commercial companies aren't going to be interested in using the software that was literally proven on a level like that?

 They're only just now adding huge amounts of people to their sales teams literally in the last six months which if you read Peter thiels book is insane for the stock because they have this crazy long term plan and he literally talks about how when they get to a certain point and start adding sales as a full sector of the company it means that is the company the company plans to BEGIN scaling. Meaning they're this big and they literally only just started on the scaling part. Which they've also said in tons of interviews if you're a die hard Palantirian like me. 



They actually also have the third side of the  business which is their actual like full AI for weaponization and war and defense for the government. Gotham is like helping analysts and commanders lead and even helping police or agents figure out what's going on. This other software is different. It's called Apollo and its only at the beginning too. It's like pure AI machine learning AI handles everything stuff. Go find a video called pentagon head of NSC briefs public on AI I think it's on the PBS channel on YouTube or some shit. Or you can listen to Joe Biden talk about how we're going to double our percentage of gdp spending on AI. The amount of government money that's going to go into AI as a weapon to compete with China DWARFS peoples expectations of how much large the market for the kind of software palantir makes is. 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201001005334/en/U.S.-Army-Research-Lab-Selects-Palantir-Technologies-Inc.-for-91M-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-Development

This is literally the backbone of everything AI that the government is about to invest in. Sure they're going to experiment with other research but if you do research you'll also find Palantir is the ONLY company that does anything remotely like this software that has anywhere near the kind of clearances like what is required for these contracts. They are currently a clearance level 5 and about to be the highest 6. The closest competitors are almost all a 3 or lower I'm not even sure if there's more than a single 4 and that stuff is crazy hard to get. 

But like again I'm an obsessive. I realize why people get so excited about the commercial side scaling and how it's very possible and can make them huge and it will. But I'm actually pretty sure the reason people like Cathy Wood has such a huge boner for them is that she realizes how MASSIVELY. And I mean MASSIVELY underestimated the amount of government revenue they will get from all this AI investing the United States and NATO are about to do. It's literally the next Manhattan project and they're absolutely going to be one of the biggest players developing it if not the biggest. I think it's funny because most people are pretty disinterested in the government stuff for Palantir but i really think the weaponized AI apollo stuff may be as big as anything could ever be. 




Also people got the insider selling stuff very very wrong. Tom Nash (love him or hate him I don't care) has a few really good recent videos where he explains it in basically full detail what was happening. The selling panicked a lot of retail investors during a time when the buying for growth markets had really slowed because of rate hike due to inflation scares and a ton of retail holders got scared and caused more selling and more people got scared because of that and sold and it really just was mass psychology in effect and a LOT of FUD and confusion. 

Basically a few executives karp in particular got billions of dollars worth of options that vest but literally expire so you have to exercise them which means you buy shares of the company at a strike price. Well because it's the company granting shares the strike price is literally 10 cents or something and these automatically have to vest at quarterly increments. So everytime karp was exercising he's actually buying shares. Like over 150 million in total maybe a lot more million SHARES not dollars. shares. And even those when he exercising he's buying shares technically from the company it ALL counts as profit on taxes and ITS NOT LONG TERM CAP GAINS ELIGIBLE. So over the last year plus this year he's essentially getting shares but the literal dollar value of those shares to the government counts as pure profit. So his total income which he's getting taxed at 40% of is in the BILLIONS yes billions. Because that's a lot to handle people that work for them actually automatically schedule sells of shares to cover the taxes so that there's no issue it's not even like him saying sell today and they do this.... TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INSIDER SELLING TO THE SEC. That's why it's automatically happening so no one can ever claim he's timing it. 

So listen cause here's where it gets important. The exercising of the shares counts as almost pure profits but remember he's receiving SHARES not dollars he doesn't actually get billions of dollars. So has to then sell SOME of the shares so he can pays taxes on that. Then when he sells the shares to pay the taxes for exercising he actually owes even more money if they went up from when he exercised. So everytime he's selling low its actually good for him because it's less ADDITIONAL PROFIT that he would owe taxes on.

 If he wasn't selling its because he thought it would go down even further and then he would actually owe less taxes overall. So if he thought it was going to tank he'd wait and actually get a nice fat discount on his taxes. 

I know this seems really crazy but I promise that's how it works you can look it up in detail but yeah shocking that mainstream media and redditors/youtubers who barely do research and have no real understanding of how these billion dollar compensations work would get it wrong. Unbelievable I know. If he had actually sold the massive overall percentage of his shares that some people claim he did the company would be at like $3-6 dollars not low 20s. Retail got confused because of market pressured due to interest rate fears from inflation and sold low (like retail always does) to institutions.",nmofz4,"Palantir DD if you want to understand company and it's history better (also insider ""selling"" explained in detail)"
5766,,2021-05-28 03:17:26,t3_nmoit0,,wallstreetbets,"This isn’t what you think. I’m not going to pitch a shit short interest play or prattle on about some pipe dream. No. I’m going to introduce you to an ultra-high-risk micro-cap play that, very well might be on the precipice of greatness.


What is Blue Apron?


Blue Apron (NYSE: APRN) was the forgotten step child, bad luck Brian, IPO of summer 2017 that priced below range and had the misfortune of debuting after Amazon bought Whole Foods. Since it’s debut, the stock has suffered dropping from nearly $150 per share (adjusted for a 2019 reverse-split necessitated to stay listed) to as low as approximately $2.00!


Why the Drop?


Management. Fucking. Sucked. The prior executive team essentially handed Chad Hello Fresh the keys to the kingdom, when they made the fatal error of betting that the “high affinity core users” would be enough to sustain the business. For this reason, they cut marketing to nearly nothing and attempted to realize operating leverage by shrinking the customer base only to its most prolific buyers.

This was stupid. HelloFresh did the opposite, essentially giving away meals, and they used it to stockpile market share. Put a chart up of HelloFresh customers against Blue Apron. You’ll see the two lines converge and a clear indication that HelloFresh stole most of their business. HelloFresh was one of the best trades of the past 5 years. Look at the chart, look at the sales, and look at the margins. They have managed to achieve operating leverage by employing affordable pricing and emphasizing retention.


Blue Apron Might Go Under....


Today the company is in a dire place. Languishing away in Micro Cap hell at an $80M market cap, no one on Wall Street wants to cover these guys. Only their bankers, CG and MS, write them research and neither are overly optimistic. They’re in a shit spot with a credit line that mandates they keep $15M cash at all times, and they keep their customer base above 300K (thus far, they’ve struggled). They’re sitting on $29M and burn enough cash per Q that they might go below that $15M level (wouldn’t be a first). All signs are negative...


But I Think They Might Win


Blue Apron is under new management. Linda Kozlowski, is the former COO of ETSY and an ex-strategist at Alibaba. She believes HelloFresh did things right and she wants to right the ship. Her ballsy-ass plan is to ride the line on cash and go all in on customer growth. She realizes those customers are worth a lot more than income on the P&L, and that she needs to make the pot as big as she can. Thus far, it’s worked. Customers are up over 20% in the past two periods and retention rates are rising. We are seeing signs of operating leverage, and it opens a big possibility.


My Prediction

Management is buying shares. They know the company is not healthy. The only logic is that they have a plan that’s working. You can’t sell a dying business with a shrinking share, but you can certainly sell a growing community, that could be an accretive asset to a better capitalized entity. I think Linda is going either get the business in a position where it can refinance for better terms, or where it can be sold to create shareholder value via a strategic alternative.

If that happen, given this is priced for bankruptcy and ignored by the Street, the returns could easily reach the triple digits. I’m long and I plan to add on additional weakness.

Everyone is talking about how the squeeze didn't even happen and the shorts didn't cover yet. What I don't understand is why wouldn't that be possible? If short interest is 17%, so let's round up to about 100M shares. Today the volume traded was 700M shares. Couldn't 100M of those 700M have been the shorts covering? And if they didn't cover, today alone 700M shares were traded, why would 100M shares bought by shorts cause a squeeze if today 700M were traded?

I have been having this question for awhile, since I noticed the same with GME. In the days preceding January 28th (when GME reached its peak), the combined volume was several times the amount of float. How come the squeeze happened and why did it happen? If the volume was so high, couldn't the shorts have covered in the days preceding that?

This indeed could have gone either way , after 2 weeks inspections it was decided that WK2 did not need to delay testing no maintenance was needed at this point. Scheduled Maintenance will commence in the fall after all tests have been completed.

The plan includes creating an online ticketing platform by Great British Railways which might have a huge blow on Trainline revenue. However, this platform does not yet exist and will probably take a couple of years to develop. Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed.

In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales.  Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%.  

I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time  for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

5797,,2021-05-28 10:41:01,t3_nmuzzi,,wallstreetbets,"Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent of Moderna which their market cap which will put share price at $800 to $1000. Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variants so as time goes on,and variants get worse and other vaccines get more ineffective ...protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length Spike protein versus a piece of the spike protein. This allows for the body to remember a larger picture of the virus therefore recognize other forms of variants easier. It's the most effective type of vaccine for covid. 

So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines so other protein competitors will be far behind and they will have an a moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing they teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine. They will be combining flu and covid vaccine by 2025 for possibly double the price of current covid vaccine.

 They are pretty much de-risked at this point. Yes you could buy other  biotechs that can go up 20x but are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that has all successful trials done so far successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development. They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment to where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place there are no more glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""

They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio. Yesterday at close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close representing about 80% of the trading volume in 5 minutes. Hedges are repositioning towards long and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

Chart on DD is in link below in another message. It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $600 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip the in mid June when P3 results come out and anticipation grows for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot securing you a decent profit on options. 

I own 138 $250 July calls along with about 1k shares. I'm all in baby. LFG I expect to turn 200k into over a million on a year's time via shares and options",nmuzzi,"Nvax DD (low float, hight short ratio, 7x future returns along with 6 -10+ billion in revanie for 2022)"

5803,,2021-05-28 11:40:22,t3_nmvyvq,,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been in AMC since January and WSB since February along with GME so here’s some advice for the newbies and people who believed the FUD that “meme stocks” will never rise again, short interest is only 20%, AMC will never hit $20, $30, etc. GME is only worth $20, the squeeze already happened, etc....

The squeeze started before today. It’s already been “squeezing” for a bit. This squeeze is a bit more controlled than January, but it’s still overall following the same trend. 

Hedge funds were playing a game of chicken to see who bails first. Some bailed, others doubled down on shorts (as late as yesterday) because they believed their own FUD that these stocks can never rise again. Others, just didn’t want to lose to the poor or disadvantaged or people shoving crayons and bananas in their orifices. Look up glacier capitals shareholder letter for a good look at the mindset of these hedge funds (it personally made me more bullish Wednesday and I’m glad someone posted it in a different sub). 

They increased their shorts, long story, short earlier this week. 

So, what does this mean? No one really knows what they are talking about. I certainly don’t know. No one here can predict the future, or really know what’s going on behind the scenes... It’s all guesses. BUT, we can make bets on possible outcomes. It bothered me how people pushed their opinions as facts, so I am not going to do the same. I don’t know what the future holds either. I’m just guessing based off what is happening now. Honestly, ignore those who think they “know” the answers. If they did, they would be rich already. Don’t take financial advice from people who are as poor as you, or poorer. I made 45k$ with 5 calls and $5k during the March squeeze. I am not rich and I don’t know what I’m doing, but I believe the gamma squeeze is imminent. If you want to believe with me, go ahead. Let’s get these tendies together. If you don’t know the ceiling or are afraid to take that leap, buy puts once it hits that all time high that those banana and crayon loving apes have been waiting for. I’m personally doing both. 

Also, please, prepare for the January bullsh!+

Stock freezes, trading halts, blocked access to buying and selling more shares, constant FUD spam, banning of live updates on gme. It’s all designed to cause a panic and stop the gamma. It worked last time, so if it ain’t broke don’t fix it. This scenario will play out for certain if we see a $100-$200 jump on gme in a single day. All “meme stocks” will be frozen or halted too. If it remains a controlled squeeze this will be postponed till next week or a later date. Still, be armed and ready because anything is possible. 

Tl;dr 

Is it too late to get in? Not really

Gme or amc? If you can afford it; both. Low budget? AMC. Higher budget; GME. 

AMC will pop first maybe so you could jump in on that if want tendies now though. 

Options or shares: Depends on budget. Ideally both. Sell calls buy shares. Buy puts when it falls back to earth. 

How far can it go? No one really knows. When the trading freezes start and panic sets in, anything can happen. Just keep calm and remember this is still only part 2 of the gamma. Part 3 will be the most epic spectacle in history :)

What is your play? I’m selling my calls before 2 pm and spreading my gains out into calls for next week and end of July. I’m buying puts as well when I identify the “limit” of high these stocks will go today. If this really is a controlled squeeze, it will continue into next week and push even higher. I’m just waiting for the moment the panic selling starts really. 

Who are you? Just a guy who learned options 2 months ago and wants to be a billionaire for personal reasons. 

Is any of this true? It’s just an opinion and advice. 

Will you help me learn this stuff? I don’t have the time. I wish I could but I have other businesses to run. Just try to learn something from this post and ask around. There are other apes who would be happy to help.

This is just an opinion, not financial advice. 

I wish you all the best of luck. It’s going to be a war zone in Season 2",nmvyvq,Just some advice

# CLASS IS IN SESSION

**Have you wondered recently with reported Short Interest of GME so low (26% of float according to MarketBeat), how has GME gone down more than 50% in the past 5 days with relatively low volume?**

**Are fellow apes and long whales selling?** Answer: NO, look at the OBV

https://preview.redd.it/wz30ba4078p61.png?width=991&format=png&auto=webp&s=80ee895d2e669bf2fd09e21d793f07408c854ec5

**Are Citadel and Friends shorting GME directly?** *YES*, but that alone is not enough to drive down GME price drastically without significant increase in reported short interest.

**Are Citadel and Friends hiding short interest thorough OTC (dark pools) and other shady options mechanisms?** *Likely yes*, but will not explore in this post.

**Are Citadel and Friends shorting ETFs directly that contain GME?** *YES*, but that’s not the entire picture

**Isn’t shorting an ETF that only contains 1-5% GME expensive and cost prohibitive?**

*NO*, and here’s why.

# Operational Shorting – Naked Shorting ETFs at a PROFIT for Citadel

**What Is an ETF?** An exchange traded fund (ETF) is like a basket of stocks that can be purchased or sold on an exchange like a single regular stock.

**Rise of ETFs** are concerning since they constitute a disproportionately high amount of US trading volume. 25% of all US equity trading volume, but only constitute 5% market cap.

**Why is there such a high ETF trading volume?** Answer: Its profitable for the APs

**What is an AP?** An authorized participant is an organization that has the right to create and redeem shares of an exchange traded fund (ETF) like big banks or market makers like Citadel

**How does Citadel make money on selling / buying ETFs?**

**Arbitrage**. The buying and selling of securities in different markets or forms in order to take advantage of the differing prices of the same asset.

&#x200B;

**Arbitrage Analogy:**

Think of ETFs like XRT as a fruit basket, and the stocks they contain fruits. Say the XRT fruit basket was $6 and contained a banana (GME), orange, and apple. And individual bananas are $1, oranges are $2, and apples are $3.  The total cost of buying the fruits individually is the NAV (net asset value) which in this case is also $6. Citadel can make their own fruit baskets by buying individual fruits but they wouldn’t make too much money since the price of the fruit basket are usually similar to the NAV. In recent years Citadel and other APs have found a much more profitable strategy – Operational Shorting.

https://preview.redd.it/ws8rv6rw68p61.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=a03cfb7f45ca8f7b93602f91a3cf3e9c73c99e63

**Operational Shorting Analogy:**

Citadel has the ability to NAKED SELL nonexistent fruit baskets (XRT / IWM) at $6 but not deliver on them until 6 days later. Flooding the market with tons of promised fruit baskets can drive down the price of individual fruits (bananas went from $1 -> $0.5, oranges to $1.8, apples to $2.7), only to buy back the individual fruits 6 days later at a CHEAPER NAV and deliver those fruit baskets to you. That fruit basket that was delivered to buyers only cost Citadel (0.5 + 1.8 + 2.7 = $5) to make, netting them a cool $1 while also driving down the price of bananas by 50%.

&#x200B;

# Operational Shorting by Citadel

When faced with “excess buying” pressure for ETF shares, **the AP/MM can sell shares “naked” and then locate or create the shares at a later time (up to T+6 for “bona fide” market making)**

Market makers, often commercial banks or hedge funds, create ETFs for their issuers by buying the securities that the funds are supposed to represent. ***But they've discovered that they can make a predictable return by delaying the purchases and selling you nonexistent exchange-traded fund shares that they will create later***. These transactions are a form of shorting – Operational Shorting as coined by Richard Evans, Professor at the Darden School of Business.

&#x200B;

# Okay.. What does this mean for GME?

**Citadel is willing to NAKED SHORT ANY ETF containing GME**, and by extension the **ENTIRE MARKET** (will show later) to drive down the price of GME.

https://preview.redd.it/2s92as8y68p61.png?width=1645&format=png&auto=webp&s=9938f5b88ba8ea2b6f504c2cfa29a1f9b783a02c

# If Citadel Shorted ETFs to Drive Down GME Price, Why Did It Go Up Today?

SEC Rules that Citadel must deliver on naked ETF shorts by T+6 by buying back the underlying shares. Today lines up just under this restriction from the first time IWM was shorted on Mar 18.

https://preview.redd.it/iu8zg41z68p61.png?width=968&format=png&auto=webp&s=9eb8e7f1d8d8143197541307f6c7a8447e2178ff

# Should Operational Shorting Make Apes Scared? 

**Operational Shorting HAS NO PREDICTIVE VALUE ON THE PRICE OF UNDERLYING ASSETS 1 WEEK LATER. Unless apes scared and paper hand**

Citadel MUST buy back the underlying stock on ETFs sold short at (T+6) WHICH MEANS IF YOU DON'T PAPER HAND THEY MIGHT HAVE TO BUY BACK GME AT A HIGHER PRICE THAN WHEN THEY STARTED SHORTING

https://preview.redd.it/ebgkm6poa8p61.png?width=1589&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2baba870a4d16123285c530129e8658166f52c2

# Conclusion

Findings from Evan’s paper on ETF Short Interest and Failures-to-Deliver: Naked Short-Selling or Operational Shorting?

>If higher levels of FTDs spill over from one ETF to another within the same AP or across different APs with overlap in their ETF market making activities, **operational shorting could increase financial instability**. When we examine the impact of FTDs across different ETFs, **we find evidence consistent with this contagion-like effect**. Moreover, we also find that **APs that are closer to their maximum regulatory leverage limit are more likely to operationally short**. These results suggest ETF trading relies on an inter-connected network of liquidity providers which, at times, pursue positively correlated **trading strategies that can be detrimental to the overall market.**”

&#x200B;

**Additional Findings on Operational Shorting and Financial Linkages**

* APs who are operationally short in one ETF, are more likely to be operationally short in other ETFs for which they serve as an AP (intra-AP linkage)
   * Proof in point: Citadel began shorting XRT to drive down the price of GME in Feb, and more recently have shorted IWM to drive down the price of GME again
* A given AP has higher operational shorting when other APs have higher levels of operational shorting (inter-AP linkage)
   * Higher operational shorting by Citadel linked to higher operational shorting by other APs
* Looking at regulatory constraints on AP leverage, **we also find that the closer a firm is to its regulatory leverage limit, the higher levels of operational shorting.** **This is consistent with a contagion-like effect that could cause entire market instability.**

&#x200B;

# CITADEL AND FRIENDS ARE FUCKED AND ON THE BRINK.

# UPTICK IN RECENT ETF NAKED SHORTING SIGNALS THAT THEY ARE CLOSER TO THEIR REGULATORY LEVERAGE LIMITS.

# EXPECT MORE NAKED SHORTING OF ETFS BUT THESE ADDITIONAL SHORTING MAY LEAD TO ENTIRE MARKET INSTABILITY

# I WILL HOLD MY BANANAS TO THE MOON

**Edit:** To clarify, my summary is that naked shorting of ETFs is easy and profitable for the APs. And while operational shorting has no net effect on the NAV of all the stocks in an ETF, they have realized it is an effective way to drive and magnify the direction of a single stock in the ETF in the direction they want it to go via other methods like direct shorting of GME.

Translation: today's rise may have been premediated by the APs since they knew they had to cover from shorting IWM 5 days ago. **Whether GME keeps rising after today no one can answer and specific dates don't matter since APs have multiple strategies to delay or shorten the delivery dates on shares sold short**. THE most effective way for **me** to deal with APs who have become more and more leveraged is to **just buy and hold**. 💎 💎 💎

**Edit 4:** This is not investment advice, I just like the stock.

The max you can lose when you buy a call is the premium you pay. With calls you are betting the price will go up so if the stock doesn't go up to the strike price before the expiration date, it expires worthless. You can also sell calls, if you own the underlying stock this is a ""covered call"" so you collect the premium from the contract and will have to sell the stock shares to the person buying the call at the strike price if they exercise it. There are also ""naked calls"" where you sell the call but don't own the underlying stock so if price goes above strike price you would have to buy the stock at that price then sell it at the lower strike price to the person who bought the call from you. Selling naked calls is risky because there is not limit to the potential losses as stock price can keep going up. This is the idea behind a ""gamma squeeze"", large firms sell naked calls that have very low probability of being exercised, deep Out of the Market ""OTM"", then if stock price makes a large jump, suddenly all those calls have a high probability of being exercised, so they need to purchase some of the underlying stock to minimize their risk.",,

This is Schwab’s minimum equity requirement to maintain a stock position in accounts that have and use the margin feature.

     AMC

     AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc

     Margin Maintenance Requirement

     Special Maintenance: 150%

If you have a special maintenance requirement on your account that is greater than the equity-specific requirement, then the account level maintenance requirement will supersede the equity-specific requirement.

Margin requirements are subject to change at any time. You must meet initial deposit requirements on all trades.

Stocks trading for less than $3.00 are not marginable.

Typically, the ongoing maintenance requirement for most stocks is 30%, but it can be much higher for volatile or lower-priced securities.

Special maintenance requirements are set at Schwab's discretion and are intended to reflect a stock's volatility and to ensure that your account maintains sufficient equity to cover large price movements. Some stocks are so volatile or illiquid that they cannot be margined.

Margin requirements may be changed due to concentrated positions, non-diversification, changes in market conditions or at Schwab's discretion.

This value is not applicable for portfolio margin accounts, which utilize a different set of calculations.",,

You won't pay any tax on Roth distributions.  That's the point - you already paid tax on the contributions, so your burden is covered.  That's why a lot of high income earners do backdoor Roth IRAs.

I do both traditional and Roth accounts for tax diversification.  I do pre-tax 401k because I expect to be in a lower marginal tax bracket when I retire, so it makes sense to defer tax payments for me (and pre-tax means more principal invested).  I only do post-tax brokerage investments after I've maxed out all my tax advantaged accounts.

Choice of accounts is highly dependent on everyone's individual situation, but it's not a bad idea to have some diversification.

Also, some of the things you said vary based on company (e.g., my current company allows 90% of income toward 401k, my last allowed 100%).",,

right now everyone wants to own a piece of AMC (or GME, or any other meme stock, but especially AMC right now).

There are only 450,000,000 shares to go around. Institutions and insiders own 30%, and short interest is 30%, so only 40% of that is available, giving ~180,000,000 shares available to retail.

One can do a quick look at bitcoin and doing some quick math there are ROUGHLY 10x the shares of AMC available as there are Bitcoin (very roughly I know but it's easy to calculate).

Given that, if AMC has a similar level of retail hype as Bitcoin and demand is strong, price can easily reach Bitcoin's price divided by 10, giving a price per share of around $3500/share.

Now earlier I said these calculations were very rough and they are, so to be conservative just cut that in half and you get $1750/share.

This is purely based on supply and demand, because retail investors do not care about valuation right now. They simply want shares.",,

Just to keep me from losing 30% in one trade... which has happened. Idk we will see if it works out. My body has lost 10k because he kept pouring money into it to cover his losses. So that’s why we agreed only $1,000

Sorry for that long essay haha. I’m ok with switching apps, Or brokerages. 2 questions.
In detail why should I leave Robinhood?

Yesterday I discovered you can use your instant deposit (from your regular bank account) on RH to flip an option quick — and then cancel that deposit keeping your profits (at least if you have the RH bank account set up and are not trading on a cash account)….

They just pull the canceled deposit from the profits. And I found this out by doing that with AMC on the gamma squeeze. Only works for a same day deposit and day trade.

But holy fuck I am very amused. Please poke holes in this free margin thesis.

**Con:** trade goes tits up and you don’t make profit and withdrawal actually hits your bank account, need to have day trades available*

**Pros**: free temporary margin up to $1k.

^(*or be confident enough the gamma squeeze is going to push the next strike above your option contract to at least break even of what you paid…. so you end up with more money than you started)

And here’s the proof from the small tests I was running this strategy with yesterday:

Alright retards listen up this is a huge play that keeps getting auto-modded out because of market cap but it's on fire, still cheap, and institutional and HFs are buying it on value.

The ticker is Ay Dee Eee Ess.

Stock has been beaten down, with a current market cap under 200mm, despite the fact that they have 60mm in net after-tax revenues remaining for 2021. They also have a state of the art manufacturing plant built in 2010 for 400mm, which is finally operating at a profit.

And as of Q1 this year, their Cash on hand was greater than their outstanding debt. The balance sheet is shaping up beautifully. 

Retard math:

400mm plant built in 2010, say it could be liquidated for 200mm

60mm in guaranteed govt incentive a/t cash flow left in 2021

Estimated 10mm ebitda in 2022 from newly signed CABOT deal

Newly acquired water purification segment saw positive ebitda for the first time this quarter, about $2mm

$200mm + $60mm + $10mm + 2mm / 19mm shares

$14.31 in liquidation value based on immediate financials. No debt.

Why is this stock only 8 dollars?

It was picked up in VIC last week and the stock has been running ever since. Cool to see one of my ideas picked up by real time traders!

So today? I'M GONNA GET MORE AIDS (that is, a d e s). Shit has nearly tripled from lows earlier this year and I don't believe it's even at liquidation value yet.",,

- Amazon wants to take bigger market share from Pharmacy business.

- Rite Aid announced Telehealth partnership with Touch Health in July, 2019.

- Rite Aid new store models are similar to Whole Foods or Amazon Fresh. 
- Rite Aid bought Bartell Drugs, paid $1.42 million per each store. 
- Amazon announced online pharmacy in place of PillPack.
- Amazon shutdown the Haven Joint Venture plans.
- In my opinion,  Amazon will buy Rite Aid and Integrate PBM, Medicines Pick up, Amazon Package delivery/pickup, Selling Amazon products at stores, Open the new pharmacies in Whole Foods and expand it every single state.

Retail Operations:
Rite Aid Operates 2500 stores in prime locations. Walgreens (WBA) paid 4.4B for 1900 of them and closed 600 of them. Assuming the remaining retail operations have similar value for stores, distribution centers, logistics fleet, etc. we can arrive at a $7.50 Billion valuation for retail operations. Keep in mind, management indicated that the remaining stores are more profitable operations than the ones Walgreens purchased.

HQ and Corporate:
The headquarters & the associated corporate governance systems in Camp Hill, PA are worth $2 billion. That's not a stretch by any means. They have trained employees, office buildings, IT & software infrastructure, vehicles, marketing, HR teams, internal procedures, etc. It would be difficult for anyone to put together a system to manage $24B in annual revenues, 2500 stores, and 48,000 employees, for less than $2 billion and Rite Aid already has that in place and being utilized.

Pharmacy Benefits Manager Operations:
EnvisionRx, the PBM, the growth driver of the future, is worth $4B minimum. It is growing. The population is aging. It has value. Actually, management paid more for it ($2B) in 2015 than all of the shares are currently valued and it should be valued appropriately.

ASSET VALUATION SUMMARY:
The sum of the above gives a grand total asset value of $13.5B. Long term debt, which should be easily serviceable thru continuing operations, reduces this by $3B. So we have Enterprise Value of $13.5B less $3B = $10.5Billion. There are other very valuable assets the company has including Net Operating Losses (NOL's), goodwill, recognized brand name, etc. that can easily justify a $12B valuation.",,

May 28, 2021 09:00 AM ET (BZ Newswire) -- Short Ideas  
The recent move in AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) has nothing to do with a short squeeze, Lightshed Partners analyst Rich Greenfield said Friday on CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""  
What Happened: 680 million shares were traded Thursday, yet AMC Entertainment only has 450 million shares outstanding, Greenfield said.  
**""If hedge funds wanted to get out of their entire position, if they were short, they could do it within minutes,""** he said, adding that the AMC Entertainment price action does not point to big institutions or hedge funds being squeezed. ",,

The Volatility of the underlying stock and the huge buying interest has forced the price up of the Put options on AMC.  Basically anyone who is trading options has been buying puts and the market makers have adjusted prices accordingly, supply and demand.  You never see a $500 put option on a $26 stock with a 1 week expiration.  Think of it this way, each option is worth 100 shares of the profit or loss on a stock.  A $500 option expiring in 1 week reduces your basis in the stock (if you were to get assigned) by $5 a share.  If you wanted to own the stock right now (for some reason) you should buy the ATM put option, not the stock itself.  It is the same as buying a $26 stock for $21.  Based upon the price action the CBOE Market Makers feel that there is a 100% chance the stock is going to decline by more than $5/share in less than 1 week.",,

What Happened: 680 million shares were traded Thursday, yet AMC Entertainment only has 450 million shares outstanding, Greenfield said.  
  
**""If hedge funds wanted to get out of their entire position, if they were short, they could do it within minutes,""** he said, adding that the AMC Entertainment price action does not point to big institutions or hedge funds being squeezed.",,
