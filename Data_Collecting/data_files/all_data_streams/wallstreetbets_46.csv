This is a huge Shopping Center Company. Was at 90 EUR \~ 109,72 USD per share when Shorters and manipulaters started to fuck us. Net Asset Value per share is somewhere around 40 EUR, 0,5 EUR Dividend, used to be 2,5 EUR and more in the passed years. Somehow the price is always going down, now at 15 EUR = 18,29 USD (!), although its value is much higher and nobody is really selling shares. They have always been setting an ""ex-dividend"", but never used to price the earnings in again (for decades !!!!) although the company is earning good money and everybody is holding and buying (hereby meaning private investors). Shorters are not able to buy back the outstanding shares anymore but somehow the stock is not rising..

Short interest was last reported at 20%-ish.  New shorts were helping to drive it sub-$20.  Cathie's exit gave them extra gumption to pull it off.

If it follows GME's squeeze->gamma play, which the rise to $31/$32 almost follows the exact same script in early January then tomorrow could be a +90% return day.  Tuesday and Wednesday of next week would be absolutely epic for call chains hedging 0DTEs that turned ITM on the last day.

Actual example: I'll make an agreement with Tom to pay him $10 for the right to buy his 100 Snicker's bars at a price of 2$ per Snickers bar. This agreement will expire June 1st. That's the call. 

Right now, his Snickers bar is worth 1$. If June 1st comes around and his Snickers bars are worth $1.50 on the market, the call is worthless because anybody, including me, can go buy Snickers from the market for cheaper than the agreement I had with Tom. I just paid $10 to make this contract that turned out to be useless. I lost $10.

IF it's June 1st and Snickers are now worth $3 per bar, I will exercise my contract with Tom and pay him $2x100 = $200. I now have 100 Snickers bars that are worth $3 each or $300 total. Subtract the $10 I paid for the contract and you have a profit of $90 if you sell your 100 Snickers on the market immediately after exercising my contract.

Everyone spent the last year either house bound, or out trying to make ends meet. All our casual fun was put on hold.

AMC is the most well known movie theatre in the world. The world is largely open again (at least in US and Europe...sorry, friends in India, South America, etc). People will want to go out again, and even with spaced seating for the near future, I predict this to be the ""Summer of AMC"".

On the other side, HBO still has some movies contracted to be released via streaming, which could prove to be a decent buck towards the fall/winter season (going shopping and then home to catch the latest movie on your home theatre), but i personally dont know if Studios will continue the direct to streaming option.

I own some small stock in AMC, instead of going Crypto (thank gods, because i dont see that lasting too much longer then a few more years, if that. Countries are starting to tax it, so there goes the ""unregulated"" part. Bye-bye, Crypto Craze), and im doing decent with it...dbled my investment at the least, headed into triple.

If youre smart, and quick, Im making a gut-feeling statement: Movie theaters, amusment parks, etc....Large gathering attraction companies, with stock, will be a smart, solid play this summer, so buy now.",,

Tomorrow, I am getting a cake, driving all the way to my parent‚Äôs place (1 and a half hour drive) and singing happy birthday to him as I walk in. Losing a substantial amount of my net worth and anger issues doesn‚Äôt give me the right to put it out on my family by ignoring them.

Porsche and Volkswagen got into a fight and owned most of the shared forcing a squeeze. It only stopped because they came to an agreement and settled. Theoretically that squeeze could have been infiitinite. 

What we have here is the same thing. Except it millions of people with the goal of triggering a 73 trillion dollar insurance plan. So theoretically it can hit 100k a share or more because the money is there.

The only time it may not happen is what brings about the biggest difference between Volkswagen and now. Volkswagen was two companies buying all the shares and not selling because they wanted a hostile takeover essentially. 

In this case it's millions of people instead of 2 people(companies). So the chances of it happening are slimmer because you need millions of people to not sell. 

So, in theory it's possible. However, we do not know the true intentions of everyone here. I would think the best bet is to hold and see how high it goes and then sell on the way down. And I would guess, because most people can't read the numbers properly or the graphs, and hopefully you picked the right high to sell down from and not just a dip from a short ladder attack or a smaller group of paper hands. 

Personally, I'm holding til the moon. I'd love to see 5-6 figures. While at the same time I'm ok with being wrong and selling at the lowest point of the squeeze cuz I make profit anyway and the hedgies get fucked.",,

Honest answer, I'm jumping in a little clueless on this one. Most of my money is in GME but since AMC is bubbling up, I figure I'll ride it for a bit, take profits (hopefully a LOT of them) and roll that into more GME.

The only DD I really know of is there are claims that AMC & GME are both shorted by an overlapping group of people. So if that group gets margin called on either bet, the other one will also moon.

I will say this, the most ambitious price projections I've seen by traders (not just Apes) is AMC peaks @$1.6M & GME peaks @$19M. I have no clue if that will happen, but I'm here to enjoy the ride!",,

If i bought a call option with $25 strike, i make money if the stock price is significantly higher than that cuz the option lets me buy a stock at $25 even though its being traded at lets say $28. Then the Market Makers get scared cuz they are obliged to deliver us those shares, and they need to buy the stocks as quickly as possible before stock price goes up even higher, and will be more costly to the Market Makers.

Let me explain how insane that is.

AMC has a market cap of almost $12billion dollars

With 450 million shares 

12 billion market cap divided by 450 million shares gets you your share price of $26


You need an extra $11,000,000,000 (billion) dollars invested to reach a price of $51 

You need  $225,000,000,000,000 (trillion) to reach a price of $500k per share.

Options can make or lose you so much money because even a small fluctuation in stock price greatly increases or decreases the value of the contract. There are other factors that come into play too such as how much time until the contract expires and other shit that I don't really understand so just look up some YouTube videos. [These might help.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0J8drGAJS4&list=PLOweupE79XXiBaeH_xBpkUcYUsrAaKQen) but the best thing to do is just start buying some options and losing money and then you'll be inspired to figure it out really fucking fast.,,

 ""Below we have a snapshot of the current options volume in AMC. As you can see in the red box the days options volume is massive ‚Äì and it heavily outpaces open interest. This is particularly true of the 25 and 30 strikes in which volume is near 150k for today.""

"" If traders are buying large amounts of calls, then market makers are short calls. To hedge these positions, market makers must buy AMC stock. Call buyers forcing market makers into purchasing stock is the essence of the options gamma squeeze.""

""To start the day our EquityHub options model was telling us that nearly 30% of total AMC gamma expired tomorrow, 5/28. We think that number shifts to 50% based on the wild volume taking place today. Because so much gamma expires tomorrow we think that AMC will likely consolidate as call options decay kicks in, which allows dealers to unwind some of their long stock hedge position.""

**TL;DR:** 

**Buy CHWY 06/11 75.5/76 Strangle**  

**Sell before market close on June 10**

As the earnings announcement gets closer, the implied volatility (IV) should increase. Now Vega--the greek responsible for the jiggle factor--reflects the option price's sensitivity to the change in IV. Higher IV means higher options price.   


IV:

* Last Earnings Call (March 30, 2021): \~75%
* Currently (May 27, 2021): 58.2%
* Difference: 16.8%

  
Options Contracts:

* 06/11 75.5P
   * Vega: 0.061
   * Current Price: $4.15
   * Expected price increase due to vega: (0.061 \* 16.8) = $1.02
* 06/11 76C
   * Vega: 0.061
   * Current Price: $4.05
   * Expected price increase due to vega: (0061 \* 16.8) = $1.02

I'll be trying to get out of the June $20 without a loss sometime in the next week or two. Other June and the July stuff I'm gonna ride for a bit and try and get some money. On the following pull back / consolidation phase I'll buy calls for the next leg.

**DD and back story -**

**The Good**

We'll get to that part in a bit

**The bad**

The history: GE was a massive company, has been around forever and was known as one of the quintessential American companies. They became this massive conglomerate that bought up companies left and right leading up to the mortgage backed securities bonanza in the mid 2000's. Not sure I'll need to remind everyone what happened at the end of that (Rhymed with Semen Mothers) but GE took it particularly bad. See after the 2008 / 2009 meltdown it turned out that not only had they lost a ton of money on derivatives and other financial products but (as would become public later) they lied to investors about it on disclosures and jumped through hoops to keep investors from finding out just how bad the situation was. Add to that some really badly timed all cash acquisitions that worked out terribly and the company was about ready to go belly up.

**The Ugly**

There is a reason that while the whole world got its act back together after 2009, GE continued to play act a paraplegic thrown in the deep end of a pool. The stock took beating after beating as news kept coming out about acquisitions that went bad (massive write downs), accounting fraud and various other losses. After getting rid of their CEO they brought in someone else to try and turn things around, then after a very short run they replaced that guy with the current CEO Larry Culp. They basically had to bribe / beg him to take the job, getting him to leave a cushy gig at Harvard where he was basically in working retirement after having earned a reputation as a corporate turn around guru.

**Making our way back to the good**

While GE's stock continued to flounder Culp got busy and started to shake things up. First he started selling divisions and companies. Some of them had been with GE forever, like the lightbulb divisions, others were acquisitions (some of which only a few years old) that were sold off. This wasn't about profiting by spinning something off - it was about cutting losses and making sense out of a massive company that didn't have a functioning balance sheet. Some of the chunks that were sold were profitable and many were not. The net effect was that he cut operating expenses more than he cut operating revenue, moving free cash flow (FCF) in the right direction (albeit still negative at this point) and raising cash from the sales.

They slashed the dividend to 1 penny. People were clutching their pearls and screaming! I mean... It was GE for Pete's sake. They've had a good dividend forEVER! This dragged the stock down more. But it shoved FCF in the right direction.

Between significantly improved FCF and money raised from selling off divisions and assets GE managed to cut its TOTAL debt from $130 BILLION to $71 BILLION (which is about where it is right now, although they do have more than $25 billion cash on hand). Oh yeah they also own 25% of Baker Hughes (valued at about $6.5 billion, that is after they sold $1 billion worth of it recently), they are also selling GECAS (airline leasing company that owned airliners and rented them out to airlines and other companies) to the global leader in the space. In return for shedding this division, which due to structural issues and insufficient scale to create real efficiencies, was losing GE $700 million a year in FCF, GE is getting $24 billion in cash, $1 billion in cash equivalents and $6 billion worth of a company (45% of the company's stock) that happens to be beaten up at the moment but is the world's largest airline leasing company and is about to have a gang buster year as airlines struggle to find planes. Could easily see the value of that swelling and then them dumping it to pay down even more debt.

**The Good - you may have to squint but it is there. I swear**

GE is now a rather lean company, especially compared to the mess that existed 5 years ago. I've given you the current cash / debt position. From that alone, doesn't seem great but I do ask that you keep in mind the trend line, from $130BB to $71BB over 5 years.

Today GE is made up of 4 divisions (they no longer make home appliances, it isn't one of the divisions. yes I know, they still are on the market but the stuff sold under the GE name in home appliances is by actually made by the Haier conglomerate and.... never mind):

**HealthCare** \- Not sure if any of you have had an MRI but if you had you may have had the same weird experience I did. Walking into the room, kind of nervous to get this big medical test to find out what is wrong with my ::Insert body party here:: and being confronted with the biggest GE logo I have EVER seen. Embossed into the side of this MRI machine. Anyway, whether you were aware of it or not GE makes a lot of tech for healthcare. from MRI machines to ultrasounds and tons of other stuff. It is a growing business that is consistently profitable and ***something*** *:: cough cough COVID knocked us on our butt and hospitals need to retool and get better::* tells me that healthcare spending is going to be rising a lot this year and next year.

**Energy -** Basically this is about steam turbines used for 20th century electricity generation (and storage in some cases). Talking huge turbines used in natural gas, oil, coal, nuclear and geothermal power plants (I think GE itself may consider Hydro power plant turbines part of this sector but I'm listing them below because that makes more sense). While not very forward looking this business has the potential to generate significant FCF over the next few years maybe even a decade or more. While some of these power sources are on their way out others (like natural gas) have seen a surge in utilization and some (nuclear) seem to be about to make a comeback. This chunk of GE is usually profitable, although not hugely so. That being said, between what happened in Texas which will require several power plants to be overhauled or replaced, existing service and new equipment contracts and the potential to grow, I think this is a worthwhile business unit to keep around.

**Renewable Energy -** Some solar, a decent amount of hydro power, a growing pumped storage segment and WIND TURBINES. These electrical generators (and in the case of pumped storage - mechanical batteries) are one of the most exciting areas for me personally when looking at the GE story. GE briefly snagged the title as producing the world's largest wind turbine (14 MW) and it is the largest one that many countries have certified for use. This thing is bonkers, every rotation of the blades produces enough electricity to power roughly 4,000 homes for a DAY. It is a monster and it has been selected for use in the next phase of the world's largest offshore wind farm and the first phase of the US' first large offshore windfarm. GE also makes onshore wind turbines, they make the truly massive turbines used in huge hydro electric damns and they also make turbines for use in pumped storage\*. This segment has up till now been generation negative FCF (losing money) however it is growing by leaps and bounds and seems poised to start adding to positive FCF a little this year or next and then growing exponentially.

\*Pumped storage is really cool. Basically you create a large body of water (like a lake) by using excess electricity made by solar and wind when it is available to pump water up hill. Then, when you need more electricity because it is night time or the wind isn't blowing you throw the turbine in reverse and it acts as a hydro electric damn.

**Aviation** \- This is the crown jewel of GE although in a weird twist of fait it delivered a kick to the nuts just as things started turning around. Needless to go into much detail as to why a business that makes its money building and servicing jet engines might be negatively effected when air travel takes a year and a half pause. That being said GE's newest engines are showing a great track record of winning orders. Doing this DD I found out that apparently when you buy commercial airliners you get to pick what engines you want (if there are more than one option) kind of like when you buy a car and pick whether you want the in dash CD player or not. GE's engines are proving to be more efficient, more reliable and cheaper to operate than their main competitor Pratt and Whitney. That means that as everyone gets waxed and vaxed in preparation for the horney party boom we are about to witness airlines have started ordering planes again and in a big way. You see, during the covid crisis airlines didn't have many customers and what most of them did was they identified their oldest and/or most problematic aircraft and sold them off various other companies in other industries or to companies that lease aircraft to airlines when they need a few to fill a gap. Now that things are coming back online airlines are ordering more planes. As other parts of the world start to open up over time this should create sustained tail winds for this division.

Oh yeah and one thing that often seems to be overlooked is that while yes, the aviation division has been beat up, management has used this as an opportunity to streamline and improve operations. Both sales and maintenance saw significant drops in revenue however the drop in FCF was smaller than would be expected because the whole time GE was improving its margins. Now as their order book starts filling up the aviation division is significantly leaner and more optimized which should mean that when the FCF starts up again this fall or this winter it should turn into a firehose.

**Other points of interest**

GE has announced a 1 for 8 stock split (that is a reverse split, for every 8 shares you own you will end up with 1 share that is worth 8X the pre split value). This makes sense for a few reasons.

1. GE has a massive number of shares outstanding and doing this reverse split will bring its stock price (adjusted for market cap) within line with its piers and should put it in a position to re-enter the DOW. Doing so will create demand for the shares as it is added to funds that track that index.
2. Once GE reinstates its dividend (which will be another catalyst for the stock to continue upwards) the lower share count means a slower drain on FCF since I imagine they will incrementally increase the dividend. It seems silly because it doesn't really matter how many shares except when you consider that they have so many that if you decide to go from a dividend of $0.01 to $0.10 the difference in share float would be hundreds of millions annualized in FCF. Obviously the target yield wouldn't be impacted but even this small thing can have a real impact in speeding up the debt reduction.
3. I fully expect that as the stock price increases and then the reverse split happens GE will do a share issuance to raise a few billion to pay down the debt. I view that as a buying opportunity as any drop in share price should be short lived and I expect the resulting reduction in debt will mean net / net share prices will increase due to the issuance.

On that note GE has committed to a stated target of 2.5 times EBITDA (which is the cutoff for investment grade securities) from the current 6 times EBITDA. Getting to investment grade will create increased upside pressure, that is why I'm saying the stock will go up when they issue more shares (even though there will likely be a temporary dip at that time).",nmkhyz,GE - a bull Thesis (F off haters - Imma go üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ to the MOON)

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote...

and balking at even a penny of additional liquidity. How the Fed will continue to monetize debt then, when the repo system is now out of collateral, is anyone's guess.

By mid-July, we‚Äôll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase higher yields in the FX swap market amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative

Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks.

Consider this also . Annual mining output is roughly 800-1000 million ounces of silver a year. They use around those numbers as well 900M a year. It's a very tight market. 330 million americans. Say 10% of americans buy 100oz physical. 28usd x 100 = 2800USD quite affordable.. 10% of 330 million = 33 million 33 million x 100oz  330 million ounces off the market. That is a big supply shortage not counting in the domino effect.........


Silver rose 35 x in the 1970s,Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. When inflation hit 3.5 silver hit 50 in 2011 . Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms.

As a ticket here I prefer PSLV, but all ETFs essentially share the same traits in that you can invest extremely large sums of money with them and it is highly liquid to get in and out of. Only the whale investors can actually take physical out, but if they are taking it out, it‚Äôs not to bring home 1,000 oz bars to use as doorstops, but probably to transfer to a vault of their choosing. These will generally move with the price of the underlying metal. Some of these ETFs  like slv  you can buy call options with, which can provide you some upside leverage. However, the idea here is to park large sums of money through your brokerage with them to realize gains over a long term. The one major downside most of these have is you are giving your money to the trust, and the trust owns the metal not you and mostly those trusts are not favored to metal price spike .",nmkmcq,"Rrp explosion , inflation spike and results for precious metal"

Of course it will be important to have someone else drive like your ~~girlfriend,~~ ~~wife~~, ~~friend~~, acquaintance who happens to be going in the same direction. 

Here are the rules: you will jot down the first 10 license plates you can clearly read once on the highway towards your destination. Best if the destination is 3+ hours. Then, take the different tags that you wrote down and search to see which of the 10 have a letter combination that create a valid publicly traded ticker. 

Chances are (based on my 20 minute drive today) that about 10-20% will be valid tickers that you, yourself, can invest money into. Look up all 10 tickers to see which ones represent a real publicly traded company. The rest of the tag is important too. Let's say you end up with just one tag that is a valid ticker and it's PRA2350. Congratulations, for the next 3 hours you must enter and then exit a position on ProAssurance Corporation starting with $235.00. 

The goal here is to make as much money over the course of the trip as possible. You have 30 minutes initially to decide what kind of position you want to take (shares, calls, puts). For some of you with deeper pockets, you may want to modify the rules to say that you have to enter a position worth $2350 in that company, or even 2350 SHARES of that company. Game works best with another degenerate who plays against you. If you get multiple tickers in your 10 tag sample, you get to choose your play. If you get zero.. the next valid tag you see that hits has to be your play.

so a bit of a preface, i'm pretty new to investing, but one thing i do know is science, so hear me out.

Tesla is known as a good long term investment because of the fact that eventually we are all going to need electric cars in hope to reduce our carbon emissions as low as possible, meaning the abandonment of the internal combustion engine... or does it? recently in the past few years there have been a lot of study's released proving that synthetic fuel or fuel basically made of of hydrogen with renewable energy like wind power is actually as carbon neutral as electric engines, i think this is dooming to tesla for a few reasons.

1. synthetic fuel is MUCH more convenient then electric. synthetic fuel is able to work in the internal combustion engine which means that people wouldn't have to replace their cars. the base model of the cheapest tesla is 35,000 dollars USD which a lot of family's(including mine) can't afford to spend on a new car, especially if our current one is working. so that's thousands of cars being left in the dust while they can be used and have a neutral carbon footprint.
2. tesla problems. from what i have heard tesla's are built like sh#t, low quality and poor assembly make them prone to needing repairs, which normal car mechanics are not equipped or trained to deal with because of the obvious. also tesla's are extremely heavy, i don't really care about that but apparently that's a huge turn off for others.
3. other industry's. so tesla and other electric car company's make electric cars, not planes or boats, so that means that those to major contributors are left out to still release a lot of co2. with synthetic fuel they can switch alongside cars making it better in that sense.
4. car fans. so i know a lot of car enthusiasts who, all hate tesla's and wouldn't buy one if they had to. they would much rather stick to their cars like Lamborghini's and other old cars that would get left out with electric cars but would still be as usable synthetic, and considering the amount of car enthusiasts in the world and how much they affect the auto market i don't see it panning out there.
5. timing. so no matter what number you agree on for how long it's going to take to switch completely electric it's stupid. so like i said earlier the majority of family's can't just drop thirty five k on a new car meaning it would take awhile to be able to get everyone electric plus the time and money it would take to build up the infrastructure to switch electric but considering that synthetic fuel uses the same stuff as petrol it would be much easier to keep going synthetic.
6. back on the subject of time, i saw a study saying we could switch completely synthetic by 2024 if we tried. whomever if you look at electric you see company's like GM saying they will have 50 new electric MODELS by 2050, do we really have that time? science say's no.

so if you take these reasons ( and they are not all, i have a few more ) into consideration tesla now might be a good stock with nice returns but now that synthetics are becoming more and more possible i am starting to think they might actually be our future. like i said I'm pretty new and relatively dumb on the mentality of other investors please leave your opinion below.",nml65m,Tesla might be a bad future investment.

6465,,2021-05-28 00:11:27,t3_nmlb2d,,wallstreetbets,"TLDR: Just loaded up on some Palantir Options with my sweet tax refund thanks to Uncle Sam <3.

Palantir Options are dirt cheap and there is a lot of eyes on it now. Call options with 100+ day expiry and within $1 of strike are selling for less than $2 per contract. Lots of analysts very bullish on this stock. As always do your own DD.

See you at the top boys.

Position: $40c June 17 '22

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Palantir will MOON soon. Get on board before we take off.

1. The company itself, Palantir; one of the only 2 **unicorn** startups to emerge from the defense sector, focused on national security, alongside SpaceX.

A real company that has built its product for **18 years**, & **PROVEN** its products on national level (UK Vaccination), US ARMY , NAVY and soon AIRFORCE, (BP) OIL&GAS Sector, Law Agency, Mining sector (rio tinto), IBM cloud, etc.

2) There were news of Palantir's Enterprise Resource Planning system with Amazon's cloud service platform Amazon Web Services, making it available to all AWS customers. AND PROVEN to be so value-adding, BP used it and saved 50 million in working capital within 2 weeks of installation, with the potential to do more if applied across their worldwide supply chain. The ERP suite can be deployed within days for all AWS customer. This is HUGE , and DOWNPLAYED last friday because of all the market shits that have been going on.

3) I would also say a lot other recent PLTR news have been downplayed, and PLTR always doesn't make a huge marketing about their announcements, like Karp has said, they believe in the long term, the value of PLTR would reveal itself.

4) The insider selloff has made the company undervalued. Remember when insiders were selling their 20% shares in direct listing at $7.50? How undervalued they were before people including Cathie Wood/ArkInvest started to realize and it rose to $27 within a month? You can take advantage of the insiders' selloffs of their long term held shares, infact, i think they are done (a lot were sold initially, but no selloff for last week) and we are going to the fking moon.

5) All the paperhands' shares and insiders' shares are going to diamond hands like Cathie Wood, who are going to hold for years. I see Cathie Wood buying PLTR like TSLA, don't forget Cathie Wood bought TSLA in 2018 (that's some insane gains), and she is the god among all fund managers when it comes to spotting a disruptive/growth stock, she literally does this for a living and got famed as the best investor now at the age of 65.

6) Cathie Wood just keep buying PLTR with 2 ARK funds, owns over 1% of Palantir, and she's not done yet. She bought at $30, $25, every $23.You are literally getting an insurance that Cathie wood would save your ass IF the stock goes under.

7) It's literally inevitable for PLTR to get more contracts and increase its revenue and growth... also not forgetting the stickiness of the contracts and business, it's hard to forgo the product after u have integrated it into your business.

8) In this Era of Big Data, PLTR is literally the leader in the dominating industry of the near future, which company/service is not going to use the best Data Analytics software in the future or even now?

9) Proven Track Record of HUGE Growth and credibility , proven 42% revenue growth YoY, expected 45% for next quarter, AT LEAST 30% for next 5 years, words of Karp. Last Year, Karp said at least 30% for YoY and he did 42% YoY like a boss.

10) Don't forget we got a $34 Price Target from Goldman Sachs after the earnings

11) If investors are justifying growth stocks' value with growth, I see Palantir time and time proven overperformed growth rate as the most bullish factor. Also, its cost is going to drive down because the main costs are from employee stock options now, which will expire in the future. And the accumulation of sticky contracts, it's also easier to maintain/update software installation than installing the software initially in new companies. It also has a huge monopoly in the fast growing industry. (added point from replying a comment)

12) It's ok that the some retards don't join us now, because they will eventually join us in the future, they always join after the rocket is halfway to the moon, they always do. And when that happens, we will still welcome them.",nmlb2d,Palantir Options - DIRT CHEAP

Yeah, i actually do feel pretty good with Nok since its a large 90k person company, in business since 1800s, PE trading well below average market PE... and their 5G pivot puts them into 8 trillion dollar market by 2030. My entry point was like 3.80  so i am green quite a bit.. and i think this will run alot longer  since the 5G pivot is many times NOK market cap even with only a small portion of the market.

Id welcome some volatility.. this stock is trapped in the option chain from MMs selling massive calls on it..volatility woukd explode my LEAPs

 ""Below we have a snapshot of the current options volume in AMC. As you can see in the red box the days options volume is massive ‚Äì and it heavily outpaces open interest. This is particularly true of the 25 and 30 strikes in which volume is near 150k for today.""

"" If traders are buying large amounts of calls, then market makers are short calls. To hedge these positions, market makers must buy AMC stock. Call buyers forcing market makers into purchasing stock is the essence of the options gamma squeeze.""

""To start the day our EquityHub options model was telling us that nearly 30% of total AMC gamma expired tomorrow, 5/28. We think that number shifts to 50% based on the wild volume taking place today.

**TL;DR:** 

**Buy CHWY 06/11 75.5/76 Strangle**  

**Sell before market close on June 10**

As the earnings announcement gets closer, the implied volatility (IV) should increase. Now Vega--the greek responsible for the jiggle factor--reflects the option price's sensitivity to the change in IV. Higher IV means higher options price.   


IV:

* Last Earnings Call (March 30, 2021): \~75%
* Currently (May 27, 2021): 58.2%
* Difference: 16.8%

  
Options Contracts:

   * Vega: 0.061
   * Current Price: $4.15
   * Expected price increase due to vega: (0.061 \* 16.8) = $1.02
* 06/11 76C
   * Vega: 0.061
   * Current Price: $4.05
   * Expected price increase due to vega: (0061 \* 16.8) = $1.02

I'll be trying to get out of the June $20 without a loss sometime in the next week or two. Other June and the July stuff I'm gonna ride for a bit and try and get some money. On the following pull back / consolidation phase I'll buy calls for the next leg.

**DD and back story -**

**The Good**

We'll get to that part in a bit

**The bad**

The history: GE was a massive company, has been around forever and was known as one of the quintessential American companies. They became this massive conglomerate that bought up companies left and right leading up to the mortgage backed securities bonanza in the mid 2000's. Not sure I'll need to remind everyone what happened at the end of that (Rhymed with Semen Mothers) but GE took it particularly bad. See after the 2008 / 2009 meltdown it turned out that not only had they lost a ton of money on derivatives and other financial products but (as would become public later) they lied to investors about it on disclosures and jumped through hoops to keep investors from finding out just how bad the situation was. Add to that some really badly timed all cash acquisitions that worked out terribly and the company was about ready to go belly up.

**The Ugly**

There is a reason that while the whole world got its act back together after 2009, GE continued to play act a paraplegic thrown in the deep end of a pool. The stock took beating after beating as news kept coming out about acquisitions that went bad (massive write downs), accounting fraud and various other losses. After getting rid of their CEO they brought in someone else to try and turn things around, then after a very short run they replaced that guy with the current CEO Larry Culp. They basically had to bribe / beg him to take the job, getting him to leave a cushy gig at Harvard where he was basically in working retirement after having earned a reputation as a corporate turn around guru.

**Making our way back to the good**

While GE's stock continued to flounder Culp got busy and started to shake things up. First he started selling divisions and companies. Some of them had been with GE forever, like the lightbulb divisions, others were acquisitions (some of which only a few years old) that were sold off. This wasn't about profiting by spinning something off - it was about cutting losses and making sense out of a massive company that didn't have a functioning balance sheet. Some of the chunks that were sold were profitable and many were not. The net effect was that he cut operating expenses more than he cut operating revenue, moving free cash flow (FCF) in the right direction (albeit still negative at this point) and raising cash from the sales.

They slashed the dividend to 1 penny. People were clutching their pearls and screaming! I mean... It was GE for Pete's sake. They've had a good dividend forEVER! This dragged the stock down more. But it shoved FCF in the right direction.

Between significantly improved FCF and money raised from selling off divisions and assets GE managed to cut its TOTAL debt from $130 BILLION to $71 BILLION (which is about where it is right now, although they do have more than $25 billion cash on hand). Oh yeah they also own 25% of Baker Hughes (valued at about $6.5 billion, that is after they sold $1 billion worth of it recently), they are also selling GECAS (airline leasing company that owned airliners and rented them out to airlines and other companies) to the global leader in the space. In return for shedding this division, which due to structural issues and insufficient scale to create real efficiencies, was losing GE $700 million a year in FCF, GE is getting $24 billion in cash, $1 billion in cash equivalents and $6 billion worth of a company (45% of the company's stock) that happens to be beaten up at the moment but is the world's largest airline leasing company and is about to have a gang buster year as airlines struggle to find planes. Could easily see the value of that swelling and then them dumping it to pay down even more debt.

**The Good - you may have to squint but it is there. I swear**

GE is now a rather lean company, especially compared to the mess that existed 5 years ago. I've given you the current cash / debt position. From that alone, doesn't seem great but I do ask that you keep in mind the trend line, from $130BB to $71BB over 5 years.

Today GE is made up of 4 divisions (they no longer make home appliances, it isn't one of the divisions. yes I know, they still are on the market but the stuff sold under the GE name in home appliances is by actually made by the Haier conglomerate and.... never mind):

**HealthCare** \- Not sure if any of you have had an MRI but if you had you may have had the same weird experience I did. Walking into the room, kind of nervous to get this big medical test to find out what is wrong with my ::Insert body party here:: and being confronted with the biggest GE logo I have EVER seen. Embossed into the side of this MRI machine. Anyway, whether you were aware of it or not GE makes a lot of tech for healthcare. from MRI machines to ultrasounds and tons of other stuff. It is a growing business that is consistently profitable and ***something*** *:: cough cough COVID knocked us on our butt and hospitals need to retool and get better::* tells me that healthcare spending is going to be rising a lot this year and next year.

**Energy -** Basically this is about steam turbines used for 20th century electricity generation (and storage in some cases). Talking huge turbines used in natural gas, oil, coal, nuclear and geothermal power plants (I think GE itself may consider Hydro power plant turbines part of this sector but I'm listing them below because that makes more sense). While not very forward looking this business has the potential to generate significant FCF over the next few years maybe even a decade or more. While some of these power sources are on their way out others (like natural gas) have seen a surge in utilization and some (nuclear) seem to be about to make a comeback. This chunk of GE is usually profitable, although not hugely so. That being said, between what happened in Texas which will require several power plants to be overhauled or replaced, existing service and new equipment contracts and the potential to grow, I think this is a worthwhile business unit to keep around.

**Renewable Energy -** Some solar, a decent amount of hydro power, a growing pumped storage segment and WIND TURBINES. These electrical generators (and in the case of pumped storage - mechanical batteries) are one of the most exciting areas for me personally when looking at the GE story. GE briefly snagged the title as producing the world's largest wind turbine (14 MW) and it is the largest one that many countries have certified for use. This thing is bonkers, every rotation of the blades produces enough electricity to power roughly 4,000 homes for a DAY. It is a monster and it has been selected for use in the next phase of the world's largest offshore wind farm and the first phase of the US' first large offshore windfarm. GE also makes onshore wind turbines, they make the truly massive turbines used in huge hydro electric damns and they also make turbines for use in pumped storage\*. This segment has up till now been generation negative FCF (losing money) however it is growing by leaps and bounds and seems poised to start adding to positive FCF a little this year or next and then growing exponentially.

\*Pumped storage is really cool. Basically you create a large body of water (like a lake) by using excess electricity made by solar and wind when it is available to pump water up hill. Then, when you need more electricity because it is night time or the wind isn't blowing you throw the turbine in reverse and it acts as a hydro electric damn.

**Aviation** \- This is the crown jewel of GE although in a weird twist of fait it delivered a kick to the nuts just as things started turning around. Needless to go into much detail as to why a business that makes its money building and servicing jet engines might be negatively effected when air travel takes a year and a half pause. That being said GE's newest engines are showing a great track record of winning orders. Doing this DD I found out that apparently when you buy commercial airliners you get to pick what engines you want (if there are more than one option) kind of like when you buy a car and pick whether you want the in dash CD player or not. GE's engines are proving to be more efficient, more reliable and cheaper to operate than their main competitor Pratt and Whitney. That means that as everyone gets waxed and vaxed in preparation for the horney party boom we are about to witness airlines have started ordering planes again and in a big way. You see, during the covid crisis airlines didn't have many customers and what most of them did was they identified their oldest and/or most problematic aircraft and sold them off various other companies in other industries or to companies that lease aircraft to airlines when they need a few to fill a gap. Now that things are coming back online airlines are ordering more planes. As other parts of the world start to open up over time this should create sustained tail winds for this division.

Oh yeah and one thing that often seems to be overlooked is that while yes, the aviation division has been beat up, management has used this as an opportunity to streamline and improve operations. Both sales and maintenance saw significant drops in revenue however the drop in FCF was smaller than would be expected because the whole time GE was improving its margins. Now as their order book starts filling up the aviation division is significantly leaner and more optimized which should mean that when the FCF starts up again this fall or this winter it should turn into a firehose.

**Other points of interest**

GE has announced a 1 for 8 stock split (that is a reverse split, for every 8 shares you own you will end up with 1 share that is worth 8X the pre split value). This makes sense for a few reasons.

1. GE has a massive number of shares outstanding and doing this reverse split will bring its stock price (adjusted for market cap) within line with its piers and should put it in a position to re-enter the DOW. Doing so will create demand for the shares as it is added to funds that track that index.
2. Once GE reinstates its dividend (which will be another catalyst for the stock to continue upwards) the lower share count means a slower drain on FCF since I imagine they will incrementally increase the dividend. It seems silly because it doesn't really matter how many shares except when you consider that they have so many that if you decide to go from a dividend of $0.01 to $0.10 the difference in share float would be hundreds of millions annualized in FCF. Obviously the target yield wouldn't be impacted but even this small thing can have a real impact in speeding up the debt reduction.
3. I fully expect that as the stock price increases and then the reverse split happens GE will do a share issuance to raise a few billion to pay down the debt. I view that as a buying opportunity as any drop in share price should be short lived and I expect the resulting reduction in debt will mean net / net share prices will increase due to the issuance.

On that note GE has committed to a stated target of 2.5 times EBITDA (which is the cutoff for investment grade securities) from the current 6 times EBITDA. Getting to investment grade will create increased upside pressure, that is why I'm saying the stock will go up when they issue more shares (even though there will likely be a temporary dip at that time).",nmkhyz,GE - a bull Thesis (F off haters - Imma go üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ to the MOON)

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote...

and balking at even a penny of additional liquidity. How the Fed will continue to monetize debt then, when the repo system is now out of collateral, is anyone's guess.

By mid-July, we‚Äôll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase higher yields in the FX swap market amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative

Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks.

Consider this also . Annual mining output is roughly 800-1000 million ounces of silver a year. They use around those numbers as well 900M a year. It's a very tight market. 330 million americans. Say 10% of americans buy 100oz physical. 28usd x 100 = 2800USD quite affordable.. 10% of 330 million = 33 million 33 million x 100oz  330 million ounces off the market. That is a big supply shortage not counting in the domino effect.........


Silver rose 35 x in the 1970s,Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. When inflation hit 3.5 silver hit 50 in 2011 . Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms.

As a ticket here I prefer PSLV, but all ETFs essentially share the same traits in that you can invest extremely large sums of money with them and it is highly liquid to get in and out of. Only the whale investors can actually take physical out, but if they are taking it out, it‚Äôs not to bring home 1,000 oz bars to use as doorstops, but probably to transfer to a vault of their choosing. These will generally move with the price of the underlying metal. Some of these ETFs  like slv  you can buy call options with, which can provide you some upside leverage. However, the idea here is to park large sums of money through your brokerage with them to realize gains over a long term. The one major downside most of these have is you are giving your money to the trust, and the trust owns the metal not you and mostly those trusts are not favored to metal price spike .",nmkmcq,"Rrp explosion , inflation spike and results for precious metal"

Of course it will be important to have someone else drive like your ~~girlfriend,~~ ~~wife~~, ~~friend~~, acquaintance who happens to be going in the same direction. 

Here are the rules: you will jot down the first 10 license plates you can clearly read once on the highway towards your destination. Best if the destination is 3+ hours. Then, take the different tags that you wrote down and search to see which of the 10 have a letter combination that create a valid publicly traded ticker. 

Chances are (based on my 20 minute drive today) that about 10-20% will be valid tickers that you, yourself, can invest money into. Look up all 10 tickers to see which ones represent a real publicly traded company. The rest of the tag is important too. Let's say you end up with just one tag that is a valid ticker and it's PRA2350. Congratulations, for the next 3 hours you must enter and then exit a position on ProAssurance Corporation starting with $235.00. 

The goal here is to make as much money over the course of the trip as possible. You have 30 minutes initially to decide what kind of position you want to take (shares, calls, puts). For some of you with deeper pockets, you may want to modify the rules to say that you have to enter a position worth $2350 in that company, or even 2350 SHARES of that company. Game works best with another degenerate who plays against you. If you get multiple tickers in your 10 tag sample, you get to choose your play. If you get zero.. the next valid tag you see that hits has to be your play.

so a bit of a preface, i'm pretty new to investing, but one thing i do know is science, so hear me out.

Tesla is known as a good long term investment because of the fact that eventually we are all going to need electric cars in hope to reduce our carbon emissions as low as possible, meaning the abandonment of the internal combustion engine... or does it? recently in the past few years there have been a lot of study's released proving that synthetic fuel or fuel basically made of of hydrogen with renewable energy like wind power is actually as carbon neutral as electric engines, i think this is dooming to tesla for a few reasons.

1. synthetic fuel is MUCH more convenient then electric. synthetic fuel is able to work in the internal combustion engine which means that people wouldn't have to replace their cars. the base model of the cheapest tesla is 35,000 dollars USD which a lot of family's(including mine) can't afford to spend on a new car, especially if our current one is working. so that's thousands of cars being left in the dust while they can be used and have a neutral carbon footprint.
2. tesla problems. from what i have heard tesla's are built like sh#t, low quality and poor assembly make them prone to needing repairs, which normal car mechanics are not equipped or trained to deal with because of the obvious. also tesla's are extremely heavy, i don't really care about that but apparently that's a huge turn off for others.
3. other industry's. so tesla and other electric car company's make electric cars, not planes or boats, so that means that those to major contributors are left out to still release a lot of co2. with synthetic fuel they can switch alongside cars making it better in that sense.
4. car fans. so i know a lot of car enthusiasts who, all hate tesla's and wouldn't buy one if they had to. they would much rather stick to their cars like Lamborghini's and other old cars that would get left out with electric cars but would still be as usable synthetic, and considering the amount of car enthusiasts in the world and how much they affect the auto market i don't see it panning out there.
5. timing. so no matter what number you agree on for how long it's going to take to switch completely electric it's stupid. so like i said earlier the majority of family's can't just drop thirty five k on a new car meaning it would take awhile to be able to get everyone electric plus the time and money it would take to build up the infrastructure to switch electric but considering that synthetic fuel uses the same stuff as petrol it would be much easier to keep going synthetic.
6. back on the subject of time, i saw a study saying we could switch completely synthetic by 2024 if we tried. whomever if you look at electric you see company's like GM saying they will have 50 new electric MODELS by 2050, do we really have that time? science say's no.

so if you take these reasons ( and they are not all, i have a few more ) into consideration tesla now might be a good stock with nice returns but now that synthetics are becoming more and more possible i am starting to think they might actually be our future. like i said I'm pretty new and relatively dumb on the mentality of other investors please leave your opinion below.",nml65m,Tesla might be a bad future investment.

7075,,2021-05-28 00:11:27,t3_nmlb2d,,wallstreetbets,"TLDR: Just loaded up on some Palantir Options with my sweet tax refund thanks to Uncle Sam <3.

Palantir Options are dirt cheap and there is a lot of eyes on it now. Call options with 100+ day expiry and within $1 of strike are selling for less than $2 per contract. Lots of analysts very bullish on this stock. As always do your own DD.

See you at the top boys.

Position: $40c June 17 '22

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Palantir will MOON soon. Get on board before we take off.

1. The company itself, Palantir; one of the only 2 **unicorn** startups to emerge from the defense sector, focused on national security, alongside SpaceX.

A real company that has built its product for **18 years**, & **PROVEN** its products on national level (UK Vaccination), US ARMY , NAVY and soon AIRFORCE, (BP) OIL&GAS Sector, Law Agency, Mining sector (rio tinto), IBM cloud, etc.

2) There were news of Palantir's Enterprise Resource Planning system with Amazon's cloud service platform Amazon Web Services, making it available to all AWS customers. AND PROVEN to be so value-adding, BP used it and saved 50 million in working capital within 2 weeks of installation, with the potential to do more if applied across their worldwide supply chain. The ERP suite can be deployed within days for all AWS customer. This is HUGE , and DOWNPLAYED last friday because of all the market shits that have been going on.

3) I would also say a lot other recent PLTR news have been downplayed, and PLTR always doesn't make a huge marketing about their announcements, like Karp has said, they believe in the long term, the value of PLTR would reveal itself.

4) The insider selloff has made the company undervalued. Remember when insiders were selling their 20% shares in direct listing at $7.50? How undervalued they were before people including Cathie Wood/ArkInvest started to realize and it rose to $27 within a month? You can take advantage of the insiders' selloffs of their long term held shares, infact, i think they are done (a lot were sold initially, but no selloff for last week) and we are going to the fking moon.

5) All the paperhands' shares and insiders' shares are going to diamond hands like Cathie Wood, who are going to hold for years. I see Cathie Wood buying PLTR like TSLA, don't forget Cathie Wood bought TSLA in 2018 (that's some insane gains), and she is the god among all fund managers when it comes to spotting a disruptive/growth stock, she literally does this for a living and got famed as the best investor now at the age of 65.

6) Cathie Wood just keep buying PLTR with 2 ARK funds, owns over 1% of Palantir, and she's not done yet. She bought at $30, $25, every $23.You are literally getting an insurance that Cathie wood would save your ass IF the stock goes under.

7) It's literally inevitable for PLTR to get more contracts and increase its revenue and growth... also not forgetting the stickiness of the contracts and business, it's hard to forgo the product after u have integrated it into your business.

8) In this Era of Big Data, PLTR is literally the leader in the dominating industry of the near future, which company/service is not going to use the best Data Analytics software in the future or even now?

9) Proven Track Record of HUGE Growth and credibility , proven 42% revenue growth YoY, expected 45% for next quarter, AT LEAST 30% for next 5 years, words of Karp. Last Year, Karp said at least 30% for YoY and he did 42% YoY like a boss.

10) Don't forget we got a $34 Price Target from Goldman Sachs after the earnings

11) If investors are justifying growth stocks' value with growth, I see Palantir time and time proven overperformed growth rate as the most bullish factor. Also, its cost is going to drive down because the main costs are from employee stock options now, which will expire in the future. And the accumulation of sticky contracts, it's also easier to maintain/update software installation than installing the software initially in new companies. It also has a huge monopoly in the fast growing industry. (added point from replying a comment)

12) It's ok that the some retards don't join us now, because they will eventually join us in the future, they always join after the rocket is halfway to the moon, they always do. And when that happens, we will still welcome them.",nmlb2d,Palantir Options - DIRT CHEAP

The premium is the amount you pay for the option contract. Each contract is equal to 100 shares of stock.  

It‚Äôs called an option because it gives you the right but not the obligation to buy the stock.  You can exercise the option which means buy the stock at the price you picked + the premium or sell the option and not buy anything and just take profit.

**TL;DR:** 

**Buy CHWY 06/11 75.5/76 Strangle**  

**Sell before market close on June 10**

As the earnings announcement gets closer, the implied volatility (IV) should increase. Now Vega--the greek responsible for the jiggle factor--reflects the option price's sensitivity to the change in IV. Higher IV means higher options price.   


IV:

* Last Earnings Call (March 30, 2021): \~75%
* Currently (May 27, 2021): 58.2%
* Difference: 16.8%

  
Options Contracts:

* 06/11 75.5P
   * Vega: 0.061
   * Current Price: $4.15
   * Expected price increase due to vega: (0.061 \* 16.8) = $1.02
* 06/11 76C
   * Vega: 0.061
   * Current Price: $4.05
   * Expected price increase due to vega: (0061 \* 16.8) = $1.02  


Total Entry Price: $8.20/contract  
Total Price Increase due to vega: $2.04  


Expected ROI: 24.8%

It is currently trading at Book Value (finviz, feel free to correct me on this), and is in the process of successfully deleveraging it's debt (rising stock prices would help with this process creating a virtuous cycle). Throw in its forward P/E of 7.36 and it looks very cheap in this most irrational of markets.

After the decimation of the US oil industry last year, CRK is also profiting nicely from their oil reserves. And with OPEC constantly pushing for higher prices, this will continue for the foreseeable future.

Short interest is currently at around 20% (finviz short number x 2, which seems to be correct). Options IV is under 40%. This is one of the last true value plays in the Energy Sector. The timing is right, come get some!

Exits for me are laid out in the chart. Assuming I reach a TP I will exit part of the position and then when it cools off for another month or two I will enter again when the technical setup looks good.

I'll be trying to get out of the June $20 without a loss sometime in the next week or two. Other June and the July stuff I'm gonna ride for a bit and try and get some money. On the following pull back / consolidation phase I'll buy calls for the next leg.

**DD and back story -**

**The Good**

We'll get to that part in a bit

**The bad**

The history: GE was a massive company, has been around forever and was known as one of the quintessential American companies. They became this massive conglomerate that bought up companies left and right leading up to the mortgage backed securities bonanza in the mid 2000's. Not sure I'll need to remind everyone what happened at the end of that (Rhymed with Semen Mothers) but GE took it particularly bad. See after the 2008 / 2009 meltdown it turned out that not only had they lost a ton of money on derivatives and other financial products but (as would become public later) they lied to investors about it on disclosures and jumped through hoops to keep investors from finding out just how bad the situation was. Add to that some really badly timed all cash acquisitions that worked out terribly and the company was about ready to go belly up.

**The Ugly**

There is a reason that while the whole world got its act back together after 2009, GE continued to play act a paraplegic thrown in the deep end of a pool. The stock took beating after beating as news kept coming out about acquisitions that went bad (massive write downs), accounting fraud and various other losses. After getting rid of their CEO they brought in someone else to try and turn things around, then after a very short run they replaced that guy with the current CEO Larry Culp. They basically had to bribe / beg him to take the job, getting him to leave a cushy gig at Harvard where he was basically in working retirement after having earned a reputation as a corporate turn around guru.

**Making our way back to the good**

While GE's stock continued to flounder Culp got busy and started to shake things up. First he started selling divisions and companies. Some of them had been with GE forever, like the lightbulb divisions, others were acquisitions (some of which only a few years old) that were sold off. This wasn't about profiting by spinning something off - it was about cutting losses and making sense out of a massive company that didn't have a functioning balance sheet. Some of the chunks that were sold were profitable and many were not. The net effect was that he cut operating expenses more than he cut operating revenue, moving free cash flow (FCF) in the right direction (albeit still negative at this point) and raising cash from the sales.

They slashed the dividend to 1 penny. People were clutching their pearls and screaming! I mean... It was GE for Pete's sake. They've had a good dividend forEVER! This dragged the stock down more. But it shoved FCF in the right direction.

Between significantly improved FCF and money raised from selling off divisions and assets GE managed to cut its TOTAL debt from $130 BILLION to $71 BILLION (which is about where it is right now, although they do have more than $25 billion cash on hand). Oh yeah they also own 25% of Baker Hughes (valued at about $6.5 billion, that is after they sold $1 billion worth of it recently), they are also selling GECAS (airline leasing company that owned airliners and rented them out to airlines and other companies) to the global leader in the space. In return for shedding this division, which due to structural issues and insufficient scale to create real efficiencies, was losing GE $700 million a year in FCF, GE is getting $24 billion in cash, $1 billion in cash equivalents and $6 billion worth of a company (45% of the company's stock) that happens to be beaten up at the moment but is the world's largest airline leasing company and is about to have a gang buster year as airlines struggle to find planes. Could easily see the value of that swelling and then them dumping it to pay down even more debt.

**The Good - you may have to squint but it is there. I swear**

GE is now a rather lean company, especially compared to the mess that existed 5 years ago. I've given you the current cash / debt position. From that alone, doesn't seem great but I do ask that you keep in mind the trend line, from $130BB to $71BB over 5 years.

Today GE is made up of 4 divisions (they no longer make home appliances, it isn't one of the divisions. yes I know, they still are on the market but the stuff sold under the GE name in home appliances is by actually made by the Haier conglomerate and.... never mind):

**HealthCare** \- Not sure if any of you have had an MRI but if you had you may have had the same weird experience I did. Walking into the room, kind of nervous to get this big medical test to find out what is wrong with my ::Insert body party here:: and being confronted with the biggest GE logo I have EVER seen. Embossed into the side of this MRI machine. Anyway, whether you were aware of it or not GE makes a lot of tech for healthcare. from MRI machines to ultrasounds and tons of other stuff. It is a growing business that is consistently profitable and ***something*** *:: cough cough COVID knocked us on our butt and hospitals need to retool and get better::* tells me that healthcare spending is going to be rising a lot this year and next year.

**Energy -** Basically this is about steam turbines used for 20th century electricity generation (and storage in some cases). Talking huge turbines used in natural gas, oil, coal, nuclear and geothermal power plants (I think GE itself may consider Hydro power plant turbines part of this sector but I'm listing them below because that makes more sense). While not very forward looking this business has the potential to generate significant FCF over the next few years maybe even a decade or more. While some of these power sources are on their way out others (like natural gas) have seen a surge in utilization and some (nuclear) seem to be about to make a comeback. This chunk of GE is usually profitable, although not hugely so. That being said, between what happened in Texas which will require several power plants to be overhauled or replaced, existing service and new equipment contracts and the potential to grow, I think this is a worthwhile business unit to keep around.

**Renewable Energy -** Some solar, a decent amount of hydro power, a growing pumped storage segment and WIND TURBINES. These electrical generators (and in the case of pumped storage - mechanical batteries) are one of the most exciting areas for me personally when looking at the GE story. GE briefly snagged the title as producing the world's largest wind turbine (14 MW) and it is the largest one that many countries have certified for use. This thing is bonkers, every rotation of the blades produces enough electricity to power roughly 4,000 homes for a DAY. It is a monster and it has been selected for use in the next phase of the world's largest offshore wind farm and the first phase of the US' first large offshore windfarm. GE also makes onshore wind turbines, they make the truly massive turbines used in huge hydro electric damns and they also make turbines for use in pumped storage\*. This segment has up till now been generation negative FCF (losing money) however it is growing by leaps and bounds and seems poised to start adding to positive FCF a little this year or next and then growing exponentially.

\*Pumped storage is really cool. Basically you create a large body of water (like a lake) by using excess electricity made by solar and wind when it is available to pump water up hill. Then, when you need more electricity because it is night time or the wind isn't blowing you throw the turbine in reverse and it acts as a hydro electric damn.

**Aviation** \- This is the crown jewel of GE although in a weird twist of fait it delivered a kick to the nuts just as things started turning around. Needless to go into much detail as to why a business that makes its money building and servicing jet engines might be negatively effected when air travel takes a year and a half pause. That being said GE's newest engines are showing a great track record of winning orders. Doing this DD I found out that apparently when you buy commercial airliners you get to pick what engines you want (if there are more than one option) kind of like when you buy a car and pick whether you want the in dash CD player or not. GE's engines are proving to be more efficient, more reliable and cheaper to operate than their main competitor Pratt and Whitney. That means that as everyone gets waxed and vaxed in preparation for the horney party boom we are about to witness airlines have started ordering planes again and in a big way. You see, during the covid crisis airlines didn't have many customers and what most of them did was they identified their oldest and/or most problematic aircraft and sold them off various other companies in other industries or to companies that lease aircraft to airlines when they need a few to fill a gap. Now that things are coming back online airlines are ordering more planes. As other parts of the world start to open up over time this should create sustained tail winds for this division.

Oh yeah and one thing that often seems to be overlooked is that while yes, the aviation division has been beat up, management has used this as an opportunity to streamline and improve operations. Both sales and maintenance saw significant drops in revenue however the drop in FCF was smaller than would be expected because the whole time GE was improving its margins. Now as their order book starts filling up the aviation division is significantly leaner and more optimized which should mean that when the FCF starts up again this fall or this winter it should turn into a firehose.

**Other points of interest**

GE has announced a 1 for 8 stock split (that is a reverse split, for every 8 shares you own you will end up with 1 share that is worth 8X the pre split value). This makes sense for a few reasons.

1. GE has a massive number of shares outstanding and doing this reverse split will bring its stock price (adjusted for market cap) within line with its piers and should put it in a position to re-enter the DOW. Doing so will create demand for the shares as it is added to funds that track that index.
2. Once GE reinstates its dividend (which will be another catalyst for the stock to continue upwards) the lower share count means a slower drain on FCF since I imagine they will incrementally increase the dividend. It seems silly because it doesn't really matter how many shares except when you consider that they have so many that if you decide to go from a dividend of $0.01 to $0.10 the difference in share float would be hundreds of millions annualized in FCF. Obviously the target yield wouldn't be impacted but even this small thing can have a real impact in speeding up the debt reduction.
3. I fully expect that as the stock price increases and then the reverse split happens GE will do a share issuance to raise a few billion to pay down the debt. I view that as a buying opportunity as any drop in share price should be short lived and I expect the resulting reduction in debt will mean net / net share prices will increase due to the issuance.

On that note GE has committed to a stated target of 2.5 times EBITDA (which is the cutoff for investment grade securities) from the current 6 times EBITDA. Getting to investment grade will create increased upside pressure, that is why I'm saying the stock will go up when they issue more shares (even though there will likely be a temporary dip at that time).",nmkhyz,GE - a bull Thesis (F off haters - Imma go üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ to the MOON)

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote...

and balking at even a penny of additional liquidity. How the Fed will continue to monetize debt then, when the repo system is now out of collateral, is anyone's guess.

By mid-July, we‚Äôll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase higher yields in the FX swap market amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative

Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks.

Consider this also . Annual mining output is roughly 800-1000 million ounces of silver a year. They use around those numbers as well 900M a year. It's a very tight market. 330 million americans. Say 10% of americans buy 100oz physical. 28usd x 100 = 2800USD quite affordable.. 10% of 330 million = 33 million 33 million x 100oz  330 million ounces off the market. That is a big supply shortage not counting in the domino effect.........


Silver rose 35 x in the 1970s,Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. When inflation hit 3.5 silver hit 50 in 2011 . Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms.

As a ticket here I prefer PSLV, but all ETFs essentially share the same traits in that you can invest extremely large sums of money with them and it is highly liquid to get in and out of. Only the whale investors can actually take physical out, but if they are taking it out, it‚Äôs not to bring home 1,000 oz bars to use as doorstops, but probably to transfer to a vault of their choosing. These will generally move with the price of the underlying metal. Some of these ETFs  like slv  you can buy call options with, which can provide you some upside leverage. However, the idea here is to park large sums of money through your brokerage with them to realize gains over a long term. The one major downside most of these have is you are giving your money to the trust, and the trust owns the metal not you and mostly those trusts are not favored to metal price spike .",nmkmcq,"Rrp explosion , inflation spike and results for precious metal"

Of course it will be important to have someone else drive like your ~~girlfriend,~~ ~~wife~~, ~~friend~~, acquaintance who happens to be going in the same direction. 

Here are the rules: you will jot down the first 10 license plates you can clearly read once on the highway towards your destination. Best if the destination is 3+ hours. Then, take the different tags that you wrote down and search to see which of the 10 have a letter combination that create a valid publicly traded ticker. 

Chances are (based on my 20 minute drive today) that about 10-20% will be valid tickers that you, yourself, can invest money into. Look up all 10 tickers to see which ones represent a real publicly traded company. The rest of the tag is important too. Let's say you end up with just one tag that is a valid ticker and it's PRA2350. Congratulations, for the next 3 hours you must enter and then exit a position on ProAssurance Corporation starting with $235.00. 

The goal here is to make as much money over the course of the trip as possible. You have 30 minutes initially to decide what kind of position you want to take (shares, calls, puts). For some of you with deeper pockets, you may want to modify the rules to say that you have to enter a position worth $2350 in that company, or even 2350 SHARES of that company. Game works best with another degenerate who plays against you. If you get multiple tickers in your 10 tag sample, you get to choose your play. If you get zero.. the next valid tag you see that hits has to be your play.

so a bit of a preface, i'm pretty new to investing, but one thing i do know is science, so hear me out.

Tesla is known as a good long term investment because of the fact that eventually we are all going to need electric cars in hope to reduce our carbon emissions as low as possible, meaning the abandonment of the internal combustion engine... or does it? recently in the past few years there have been a lot of study's released proving that synthetic fuel or fuel basically made of of hydrogen with renewable energy like wind power is actually as carbon neutral as electric engines, i think this is dooming to tesla for a few reasons.

1. synthetic fuel is MUCH more convenient then electric. synthetic fuel is able to work in the internal combustion engine which means that people wouldn't have to replace their cars. the base model of the cheapest tesla is 35,000 dollars USD which a lot of family's(including mine) can't afford to spend on a new car, especially if our current one is working. so that's thousands of cars being left in the dust while they can be used and have a neutral carbon footprint.
2. tesla problems. from what i have heard tesla's are built like sh#t, low quality and poor assembly make them prone to needing repairs, which normal car mechanics are not equipped or trained to deal with because of the obvious. also tesla's are extremely heavy, i don't really care about that but apparently that's a huge turn off for others.
3. other industry's. so tesla and other electric car company's make electric cars, not planes or boats, so that means that those to major contributors are left out to still release a lot of co2. with synthetic fuel they can switch alongside cars making it better in that sense.
4. car fans. so i know a lot of car enthusiasts who, all hate tesla's and wouldn't buy one if they had to. they would much rather stick to their cars like Lamborghini's and other old cars that would get left out with electric cars but would still be as usable synthetic, and considering the amount of car enthusiasts in the world and how much they affect the auto market i don't see it panning out there.
5. timing. so no matter what number you agree on for how long it's going to take to switch completely electric it's stupid. so like i said earlier the majority of family's can't just drop thirty five k on a new car meaning it would take awhile to be able to get everyone electric plus the time and money it would take to build up the infrastructure to switch electric but considering that synthetic fuel uses the same stuff as petrol it would be much easier to keep going synthetic.
6. back on the subject of time, i saw a study saying we could switch completely synthetic by 2024 if we tried. whomever if you look at electric you see company's like GM saying they will have 50 new electric MODELS by 2050, do we really have that time? science say's no.

so if you take these reasons ( and they are not all, i have a few more ) into consideration tesla now might be a good stock with nice returns but now that synthetics are becoming more and more possible i am starting to think they might actually be our future. like i said I'm pretty new and relatively dumb on the mentality of other investors please leave your opinion below.",nml65m,Tesla might be a bad future investment.

7839,,2021-05-28 00:11:27,t3_nmlb2d,,wallstreetbets,"TLDR: Just loaded up on some Palantir Options with my sweet tax refund thanks to Uncle Sam <3.

Palantir Options are dirt cheap and there is a lot of eyes on it now. Call options with 100+ day expiry and within $1 of strike are selling for less than $2 per contract. Lots of analysts very bullish on this stock. As always do your own DD.

See you at the top boys.

Position: $40c June 17 '22

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Palantir will MOON soon. Get on board before we take off.

1. The company itself, Palantir; one of the only 2 **unicorn** startups to emerge from the defense sector, focused on national security, alongside SpaceX.

A real company that has built its product for **18 years**, & **PROVEN** its products on national level (UK Vaccination), US ARMY , NAVY and soon AIRFORCE, (BP) OIL&GAS Sector, Law Agency, Mining sector (rio tinto), IBM cloud, etc.

2) There were news of Palantir's Enterprise Resource Planning system with Amazon's cloud service platform Amazon Web Services, making it available to all AWS customers. AND PROVEN to be so value-adding, BP used it and saved 50 million in working capital within 2 weeks of installation, with the potential to do more if applied across their worldwide supply chain. The ERP suite can be deployed within days for all AWS customer. This is HUGE , and DOWNPLAYED last friday because of all the market shits that have been going on.

3) I would also say a lot other recent PLTR news have been downplayed, and PLTR always doesn't make a huge marketing about their announcements, like Karp has said, they believe in the long term, the value of PLTR would reveal itself.

4) The insider selloff has made the company undervalued. Remember when insiders were selling their 20% shares in direct listing at $7.50? How undervalued they were before people including Cathie Wood/ArkInvest started to realize and it rose to $27 within a month? You can take advantage of the insiders' selloffs of their long term held shares, infact, i think they are done (a lot were sold initially, but no selloff for last week) and we are going to the fking moon.

5) All the paperhands' shares and insiders' shares are going to diamond hands like Cathie Wood, who are going to hold for years. I see Cathie Wood buying PLTR like TSLA, don't forget Cathie Wood bought TSLA in 2018 (that's some insane gains), and she is the god among all fund managers when it comes to spotting a disruptive/growth stock, she literally does this for a living and got famed as the best investor now at the age of 65.

6) Cathie Wood just keep buying PLTR with 2 ARK funds, owns over 1% of Palantir, and she's not done yet. She bought at $30, $25, every $23.You are literally getting an insurance that Cathie wood would save your ass IF the stock goes under.

7) It's literally inevitable for PLTR to get more contracts and increase its revenue and growth... also not forgetting the stickiness of the contracts and business, it's hard to forgo the product after u have integrated it into your business.

8) In this Era of Big Data, PLTR is literally the leader in the dominating industry of the near future, which company/service is not going to use the best Data Analytics software in the future or even now?

9) Proven Track Record of HUGE Growth and credibility , proven 42% revenue growth YoY, expected 45% for next quarter, AT LEAST 30% for next 5 years, words of Karp. Last Year, Karp said at least 30% for YoY and he did 42% YoY like a boss.

10) Don't forget we got a $34 Price Target from Goldman Sachs after the earnings

11) If investors are justifying growth stocks' value with growth, I see Palantir time and time proven overperformed growth rate as the most bullish factor. Also, its cost is going to drive down because the main costs are from employee stock options now, which will expire in the future. And the accumulation of sticky contracts, it's also easier to maintain/update software installation than installing the software initially in new companies. It also has a huge monopoly in the fast growing industry. (added point from replying a comment)

12) It's ok that the some retards don't join us now, because they will eventually join us in the future, they always join after the rocket is halfway to the moon, they always do. And when that happens, we will still welcome them.",nmlb2d,Palantir Options - DIRT CHEAP

Its not yet publicly traded and I was thinking of throwing some money in with the hope that it will either get bought out by a larger manufacturer or the share price will increase when they go public. I like how their vehicles look and this seemed interesting to me.

Then I thought about it and thought it was a little weird that a company would advertise to invest in it to the public? Then I thought I remembered someone  told me that the general public cannot invest in a pre IPO stock because they aren't considered a sophisticated investor. Then I thought this might be some type of scam.

don't do anything, let them be called away. it's too late now.

even if you roll, you won't be able to sell your shares for this extra gain.

if the price goes back to 10, you missed out on the gain to 19 as well.

the best case scenario is that you roll and someone actually exercises the option early, but I don't think that's likely. people usually sell to close the option for a profit rather than exercise, especially if there will be a squeeze. exercising the option during a squeeze will require a lot of money. it's much simpler to sell the call to someone else.",,

But we can run with the AMC example: AMC is at 26.51 at the writing of the comment, and a call option expiring June 4th @ 15$ is currently sitting at 12.05 per 1 share, BUT typically options are sold together for 100 shares, so buying 1 option contract would cost 1205 (12.05*100). Now your break even point would be sitting at 27.05 (15 strike price+12.05 premium)... the moment you‚Äôre above 27.06 you are making a profit. But you‚Äôre right in partially where you could exercise at 27.06 and make profit ((27.06-27.05)*100) to arrive at whatever your profit would be.

I‚Äôm using arbitrary numbers so also a rule of calls (which makes them particularly attractive to some) because your profit is virtually unlimited because the price of a stock could be infinite (theoretically).

I hope that makes more sense! Feel free to PM me if you need anymore explanation; sometimes there could be an ELI5 for finance but def do your own research because the stock market is inherently risky and options have a significantly higher level of risk! Be safe and do the DD!",,

This sub is and always was for those people who are making crazy bets that can make alot of money or lose it all. Those that lost it all would post it as loss porn for all to celebrate. And those that made great gains would show off their successful bets...hence the word bets in the name of the sub.

Everyone starts off not knowing the complexities of the market and even those that are experienced don't fully understand all the complexities which is perfectly fine.

What you seem to not understand is that this particular sub is not for people who are just starting out. There are plenty of subs like r/stocks or r/investing for people who are new and don't understand the simple basics like options trading strategies, credit spreads, derivatives, market caps, simple KPIs, and FDs.

Its also not a sub dedicated to a few stocks being spammed over and over again nor some moral fight against the big bad guys...... It's gamblers sub for all kinds of crazy bets.

You're trying to sound smart but you're an immature moron. 

That doesn't mean I want you to lose money or I'd be upset if you are making big gains. I hope everyone makes money. I gauge my success not on how others are doing but against my own internal goals....

So again fuck off you annoying dumbass.",,

if you're new to investing, your smartest investment is index funds for steady long term gains that build wealth. 95% of what I'm in right now is FLCNX in my 401(k) or VUG (vanguard growth ETF) for individual. Even experienced traders have difficulty beating index funds. Seeing massive gains in here can be misleading because of survivorship bias: they often (with exceptions) also have massive losses from high risk trading strategies like buying options that can average out to a loss. Focus first on investing in the overall market to study patterns in it and help you become a better investor.

What OP used were stock options which act like a multiplier on gains, or losses.
