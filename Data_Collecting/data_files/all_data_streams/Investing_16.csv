Oatly Group AB, the vegan food and drink maker, jumped in its debut after pricing its initial public offering at the top of a marketed range.

Shares opened Thursday at $22.12 in New York, a 30% jump from their $17 IPO price. The company and its investors sold more than 84 million American depositary shares on Wednesday, raising more than $1.4 billion. The Swedish company had offered the shares for $15 to $17 each.

Oatly’s shares, which rose as much as 34%, were up 29% to $21.95 at 1:39 p.m., giving the company a market value of about $13 billion, based on the outstanding shares listed in its filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

In July, it secured $200 million in new capital from investors led by Blackstone Group Inc. The group also included celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey and Jay-Z, as well as Starbucks Corp. founder Howard Schultz. The company was valued at about $2 billion in that round.


Both Jay-Z, through his company Roc Nation, and Schultz also participated in the IPO, according to people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private information. A representative for Oatly declined to comment. Roc Nation and Schultz didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

The IPO underscores plant-based products’ jump into the mainstream, as environmental and health concerns spur consumers to seek alternatives to traditional meat and dairy products. Investors have been looking for ways to replicate the public-market success of Beyond Meat Inc., whose shares have surged more than 300% since it went public in May 2019.

Oatly’s biggest obstacle might be its own popularity. Since its entrance into the U.S. market in 2017, finding Oatly in coffee shops and supermarkets has become something of a treasure hunt for shoppers.

The company opened a $15 million Millville, New Jersey, plant in 2019 to help meet the growing demand, but even now, shortages are frequent, as Covid-related delays have kept a planned second U.S. production from coming online.

In March, supermarkets across the U.S. -- and even its big new customer Starbucks -- reported trouble procuring orders.

While the current shortage won’t end overnight, Chief Executive Officer Toni Petersson sounded an optimistic note.

Fulfilling Orders
“This year, we will bring on board new capacity every single quarter,” he said in an interview ahead of the first trade. The company is expanding its Netherlands plant, putting out commercial products from its Utah plant, and is doing test runs in Singapore, where the factory will be “up and running” in the second quarter, he said.

For now, Oatly is only filling 70% of orders in its key markets, so it is “not really” taking on new customers, Petersson said, adding that the gap is between supply and orders, not supply and demand. “First we will close the gaps, then expand with new retail partners,” he added.

Oatly was started in 1994 by brothers Rickard and Bjorn Oste. Using technology based on research from Sweden’s Lund University, the company turns fiber-rich oats into liquid food.

Oatly’s offering was led by Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Credit Suisse Group AG. The shares are trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol OTLY.",Oatly Jumps in Debut After Raising $1.4 Billion in IPO,,

I am looking forward to opening a position on Amazon but I still have a tiny small doubt in my mind, I am wondering if posting my doubt here can help me clear it or better understand it.

The doubt I have is that wouldn't reopening cause a decrease of deliveries on [amazon.com](https://amazon.com)? [amazon.com](https://amazon.com) seems to be hot last year because people don't want to go to stores to buy stuff but once the store opens, wouldn't the traffic of [amazon.com](https://amazon.com) go down? Also, since people are at home more, AWS was getting a lot more traffic from their popular clients such as Netflix. But once the economy reopens, people won't stay at home as much and therefore not go on to AWS-hosted websites as much, right? Other services such as Twitch and Amazon Prime should have lower traffic too because of people spending less time at homes. The only few services I think of might benefit are Whole Foods and IMDb.com.

But somehow, analysts seem very bullish on Amazon's short-term. I am seeing a bunch of $4000-$5000 price targets. Why are analysts giving such high price targets when so much of Amazon's revenue depends on the environment of staying at home?

Thanks for sharing your thoughts!",How will reopening affect Amazon?,,

8,2021-05-21 13:36:56,t3_nhspuq,nhspuq,investing,"Investment Thesis for Daily Journal (DJCO)

Introduction:  The Daily Journal is viewed by the general public as a dying newspaper business.  It is a dying newspaper business, but the Daily Journal has pivoted itself to a SaaS business, but is trading at a valuation far below most other publicly traded Saas businesses.  We will investigate why the Daily Journal is a worthwhile investment at its current valuation.

Management:  Normally, we’d begin by looking at the business, but management within the Daily Journal is incredibly strong, so this will be our beginning.  The Chairman of the Board in Charlie Munger, Vice-Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway.  He bought the Daily Journal in 1977 for $2 million dollars and has been the Chairman ever since.  The lesser known name leading the Daily Journal is Gerald Salzman.  He joined the Daily Journal in 1986 as their President, CEO, CFO, Treasurer.  As such, there is likely no one else who knows the Daily Journal as well as Gerald Salzman.  As an added bonus to the quality of the two men leading the Daily Journal, their executive compensation is almost unheard of.  The Board of Directors receive a payment of either $5000 or $0.  Gerald Salzman, the CEO, receives a salary of $250,000.  These are acceptable salaries due to the large amount of insider ownership within the Daily Journal.

The Business:  The Daily Journal has three business segments, 1) The Daily Journal Newspaper, 2) Equity Investments, and 3) Journal Technologies.

---

The Daily Journal Newspaper is a series of mostly California based legal newspapers.  Their revenue comes from advertising from display advertising (i.e. traditional advertising found in most newspapers), classified advertising, trustee notice sale advertising, legal notice advertising, and circulation advertising.  The sad but unfortunate truth for investors is that this portion of their business is worth very little.  The good news, however, is that most investors outside of the Daily Journal are not interested in investing in a dying newspaper and thus has led to the undervaluation of the Daily Journal.

I won’t spend any more time on this segment except to say that the newspaper’s most successful year isemi-modern history was during 2008 due to an extreme uptick in the need for legal advertising relating to the foreclosure of many homes.  It is possible that if another recession strikes, the newspaper business of the Daily Journal could provide some financial cushion to keep the Daily Journal in strong health.

---

Equities have been a growing proportion of the Daily Journal’s intrinsic value.  Charlie Munger’s investing prowess that has benefited Berkshire is also at work within the Daily Journal.  We have insight into the Daily Journal’s American investments thanks to their most recent 13F filing, which was released within the last week.  At this time, the Daily Journal holds $197 million worth of American equities, mostly concentrated in financial services similarly to the holdings of Berkshire Hathaway.  Another notable holding is a new and growing position in Alibaba.  

While it is not explicitly confirmed, there is a VERY strong evidence that the Daily Journal also holds a sizable position in BYD, a Hong Kong traded electric car manufacturer.  This would not appear in its 13F filings, so its size cannot be confirmed, however we can make an educated guess.  The exact value of his BYD investment is unknown, however it is assumed to be be roughly $140 million.  In the most recent filing, the Daily Journal notes that it sold $20 million of one of its positions to reinvest into another security.  The suspicion is that this was a shift from BYD to BABA.  As such, we will value the BYD position at $120, though in truth, it may be slightly higher as BYD traded at a fewer dollars higher of a valuation prior to the most recent filing.  Nonetheless, we will assume its value is $120 million.  This brings the Daily Journal’s equity portfolio to a value of $317 million.

The Daily Journal also has $27 million in cash according to their latest annual report and they hold some office buildings in Los Angeles and in Utah which THEY value at $16.5 million.  I emphasized that they value the building because, as I’ll discuss below, the company has some questionable accounting practices.  In the instance of the office buildings in Los Angeles as an example, they valued the buildings at $16.5 million roughly 20 years ago and that figure has never been adjusted.  The result is that they are likely undervaluing the true value of their real estate holdings.  If we increase the value of these holding to $30 million, which seems like a fair appraisal for their buildings based on current market rate, this results in a total equity and asset value of $374 million.

Their liabilities consist of ~$60 million in deferred capital gains (0% interest), a $29.5 million margin loan (3% interest), and a $1.5 million mortgage (4% interest).  The deferred capital gains will not be paid anytime soon as Charlie Munger likes to hold stocks and when he sells, typically he will move into another qualified investment.  The margin loan was used to acquire businesses to build the Saas business and is serviced by the dividends from the bank stocks in the equity portfolio.  The mortgage is self explanatory.  Total liabilities amount to $91 million

Before jumping into the last portion of the Daily Journal’s business segment, I want to note that the Daily Journal has a market cap of $414 million.  As such, to reach its market cap valuation, assuming no value is assigned to the legal newspaper business (it has a value, it’s just not a high value and in all honesty, I don’t know what a fair value is for that business), the Journal Technologies business only needs to be worth $131 million to come a fair market value at its current market cap valuation.

---

Journal Technologies is the hidden gem of the Daily Journal.  It is a legal Saas business being sold to municipalities via the RFP process.  It is a case management system built off of a central e-Suites product that is then configured to meet the client’s needs.

It has a unique business model that results in, once again, an undervaluation of the company.  After being awarded an RFP, the company will then define the scope of the product, establish servers on site, and install its product, and then configure it to the clients needs.  All of this work takes 4 to 8 years to complete and during this time, the municipality is not billed.  On a relevant note to the questionable accounting practices above, the Daily Journal does not report the forthcoming revenue on its financial statements, thus these contracts have not necessarily been taken into account to determine the Daily Journal’s current market valuation.

When its e-Suites product goes live, the Daily Journal will charge an implementation fee and subsequently bill a licensing fee for the next 10 years (with built in price adjustments to account for inflation).  Currently, Daily Journal has over $100 million in forthcoming revenue which, due to their billing practices, is a very high-margin revenue once billing starts.  These contracts are found in the USA, Australia, Canada, and Tasmania currently, though more may have been signed and not discovered.  Credit to Matthew Peterson for taking the time to search across the web looking for tenders awarded to the Daily Journal, as there is not a central repository to identify these contracts.

Moving forward, the assumption is that the Daily Journal will continue onboarding new jurisdictions, there will be an increase in licenses purchased for existing contracts after e-Suites launches, consulting fees for upgrades and modifications will increase, and other e-solutions will be integrated with e-Suites to increase revenue (such as e-payment for fines and tickets).

While the Journal Technologies already has $30-some million in revenue, this figure will increase with time.  Additionally, these municipalities will likely continue using the e-Suite services once they go live after the time and cost of configuration, meaning revenue that is on the books today is revenue that will be on the books likely after the 10 years of licensing has expired.  Presently, Journal Technologies is a $200-$300 million business based on the figures and assumptions above.  Under this assumption, the Daily Journal is valued somewhere between $483 million and $583 million, meaning it is currently undervalued by 17% to 41%.

---

There are a few risks that need to be mentioned.  One is liquidity.  The Daily Journal has a $400 million dollar market cap and is too small for many large financial institutions to monitor.  It also has a $300 share price which, while irrelevant to value, will scare away many newer retail investors who invest $20 to $50 at a time.  Beyond these two issues, the Daily Journal has quite a bit of insider ownership or is owned by firms with long-term visions, thus they are not willing to sell shares on a daily basis.  The result is that only about 5,000 shares are traded on a daily basis.  This means that if you need to liquidate your position in a pinch, you may have to sell below the market rate.

The other glaring issue is age.  Charlie Munger is 97 years old and Gerald Salzman is 80 years old.  Beyond not being at the forefront of technological innovation on a personal level (some may view this as an issue when running a Saas business, personally I am not concerned as there job is to manage the people driving the Saas business), their old age means that in the coming years, their leadership may cease to exist.  No clear succession plan has been identified (this was raised during their last annual meeting by a concerned shareholder).  As management is a key strength within this business, this could be reason for pause for prospective shareholders.

Lastly, there is the $16 billion elephant in the room.  Tyler Technologies is their key competitor.  There are other smaller competitors who offer more limited solutions, but Tyler Technologies is the real competition in this space.  While their products are more modern and (likely) have better and flashier features, this is not necessarily what wins in RFP processes.  Instead, the Daily Journal’s practice of not charging the client until launch is a much more appealing catch for prospective clients.  While I’m sure Tyler Technologies will be a fine company in the long-term, its hard to argue that their fundamentals are nearly as attractive as the fundamentals of the Daily Journal.  The Daily Journal is valued at 8x sales, has a P/B of under 2, and has a P/E of 3.5.  By comparison, Tyler Technologies has a P/B of 8, is valued at 14x sales, and has a P/E of 91.  Tyler Technologies would need to continue growing at a very rapid pace to be a strong value investment (note that Tyler Technologies is still rapidly growing, though this rapid growth is slowing).  By comparison, the Daily Journal, if it continues at its current growth, is already a great investment.  As most clients are onboarded, growth is increasing and it is my belief that this will be a phenomenal investment.

This is especially true in states like NY where restrictions are tighter than Miami. 

As the CDC loosens fask mask restrictions for vaccinated people, I’m seeing a ton of young people outside (maskless) in strict areas like NYC. The streets look like a Miami Spring Break - a whole gathering of young people in the streets in large numbers and no masks to be found. 

The big takeaway, however, is that masks are strictly enforced inside all establishments. Using restaurants as an example, customers must wear masks when they enter/exit and move around, but they are not required to wear masks when they eat. Most importantly, business employees MUST wear masks at all times, and will therefore go through masks at a much quicker pace. The business itself will have to provide PPE for their employees, leading me to conclude the future of COVID era PPE is B2B (in the US / EU and countries with access to vaccinations). 

What company is best situated to provide business with direct PPE supply? OPTEC International (OPTI) acquired WeShield - a B2B PPE supplier, with clients from Old Navy to Carl’s Jr. What led me to OPTEC and WeShield however, is an [article ](https://www.bkreader.com/2021/04/14/nyc-restaurants-gifted-free-ppe-through-new-partnership/)I found about their PPE donations to NYC restaurants through a partnership with the NYC Hospitality Alliance. It turns out the WeShield is run by fellow restaurant owners turned medical suppliers. In the article, a WeShield spokesperson said that the PPE cost of a restaurant is about $5-10 per employee, per day. 

The article also acknowledged that alleviating PPE costs for independent restaurants is what sparked their donation campaign. But without donations, $5-10 per employee per day really adds up and leaves us with a still emerging market of PPE buyers. Not just restaurants but all brick and mortar businesses are new customers in a space that was mostly used by healthcare organizations.

It will be interesting to see how the divide for public vs commercial PPE restrictions grows and which sectors maintain their status as large quantity PPE purchasers. For now, restaurants and retail locations have no plans on changing their PPE policies which leaves a niche market for suppliers like OPTEC.","Is supplying PPE directly to business the way forward for PPE providers in the US, EU?",,

Disclosure I do not own any shares. 

I came across LOTZ in a stock screener as I had set a price target of $5 and noticed it got close to it.  To keep with the discipline of doing more research upon researching the 1st price target I dug deeper and did the following model.  

Summary
Carlotz is really a lead-gen tech business to help rental fleets and consumers sell directly to retail  vs. going through the auction process.  They eliminate the extra step and fees that is entailed in auction houses.  The company also allows consumers to sell their cars to other consumers with Carlotz being the ""broker"" that makes the process easy for both parties. 
The revenues are: flat fee from buyer, fee from seller (used to inspect, clean car and take pics), financing and insurance upsells and lease income.  

However, the company reports the total car sale as the revenue which is a bit funky but legal.  This is why the GROSS margins are 10% to 12%, if the Gross Margins were the ""revenues"" the company would only show a revenue of $35 million for 2021 vs. $350 million, kinda hard to sell a SPAC at a $1.4 billion valuation when the revenues are $35 but with eventual ""80% EBITDA margins"". 

I ran a 10 year model and do believe the company can become profitable by 2023 unless they keep expanding more aggressively than modeled but by 2024 they can grow organically using cash flow.  

I think the stock is a buy at $4 since at this price we have some downside protection of the cash on the balance sheet of around $2 and at that price you are only paying a 1x enterprise value to multiple multiple which is on the low side compared to historical of Carvana, KAR and others. 

Would I want to own this business forever?  No,  but I think it can go from $4 to $10 to $15 pretty quickly if the GROSS margins go to 13% to 15% as they originally projected in their investor presentation, however in my 10 year model I do not see 15% margins until 2030z Management has missed guidance on revenues for 2021 and margins and the street doubts they can meet their numbers for this year.  This is the risk and why I think it may trade lower in the short-term.  

2021 rev 330mm and 1x ev would be $4 and 2x ev is $8

2022 rev is 850mm and 1x ev is $8 and 2x would be $16

2023 rev would be $1.4 billion and 1x ev would be $12 and at 2x ev would be $24

The execution risk is will they be able to meet these revenue targets and go from the current 10% gross margins to the 13% they said they would be able to do on the Octoeber 2020 investor deck. 

It could eventually become a takeover target as we have now 5 to 10 companies in this space and companies are always looking for growth. 

Anyway interested to hear your thoughts on this. I can definitely go more granular into the business model but for simplicity sake kept it short.

Looking forward to your comments!",$LOTZ is this bottom for Carlotz? Or do we go lower? I think worth $4 to $24 over a few years.,,

Have you ever heard of the Norwegian State Fund?  No?  Not only is it the largest fund in the world, but it is also considered one of the most cleverly managed.  He has built a huge fortune from virtually nothing through constant, low-risk investing.  His strategy has proven itself over various market cycles and can certainly be a blueprint for private investors.  But how exactly did this come about and what has the fund done right in the past?

The story began in the 1960s when oil was first found off the coast of Norway.  From the beginning, Norwegian politicians made it important that the inhabitants benefit from the wealth of raw materials: not only through sovereignty over mineral resources, but also through jobs.  The oil industry paid really well and pulled the wages of other industries with it.  In the medium term, this meant that inflation rose.

With the first oil price shock, the demand for Norwegian crude oil also fell.  Economic growth collapsed.  At the same time, the amount of foreign currency debt rose.

Norwegian politicians stuck to their long-term perspective.  They no longer wanted to make the Norwegian economy so dependent on oil and they also wanted to avoid the high export surpluses that had been common up until then, because that affected exchange rates and inflation.  That is why they came up with the idea of ​​completely investing the excess payments from oil exports abroad.  Quasi: Oil leaves the country, but the money received for it does not enter the Norwegian economic cycle.

The so-called oil fund came into being in the mid-1990s.  In this state-managed investment fund, the income from Norway's crude oil and natural gas sales is invested, all of the income, not just part of it.  The oil fund invests worldwide, long-term and according to ethical principles.  His goal is to provide for the financial future of all Norwegian residents if the income from oil and gas no longer flows at some point.

While private investors often act from the gut, the oil fund has clear rules and guidelines.  His goal is to invest the money optimally in the long term from a risk-return perspective.  Because the fund is responsible for the financial future of many generations to come.  Anyone can view the investments and results of the oil fund on the Internet at any time.  So there is great transparency.

The Norwegian Oil Fund is a low-risk, profitable investment in the future and can therefore serve as a role model for private investors.

Since 1998 the oil fund has grown to the equivalent of over one trillion euros.  This corresponds to a value of around 190,000 euros per inhabitant.

It's all about the right mix:

Since 1998, the oil fund has achieved an average gross return of a good six percent per year before costs, inflation and taxes.  The income fluctuates depending on the stock market situation: In some years there is even a minus, in others double-digit returns are recorded.  The fund invests very successfully in the long term.  But how exactly does it work?

The steady returns are possible because the oil fund diversifies its investments across different asset classes and across different industries and regions.

The three asset classes in which the oil fund invests are stocks, bonds and real estate.  Stocks fluctuate more than bonds, so they are riskier.  In return, they generate better returns.  Since the oil fund thinks long-term, it overweight equities, currently at around 70 percent.  Real estate is only a small addition.  The rest goes into bonds.  According to modern portfolio theory, those responsible expect the best risk-return ratio from this.  The proportion of stocks in relation to bonds and real estate is regularly checked and adjusted to the target - also known as rebalancing.

For equity investments, the oil fund is based on the FTSE Global All Cap.  This is a stock index that contains around 8,000 stocks from large, medium and small companies around the world.  However, the oil fund deviates somewhat: European stocks, for example, are overweight and US stocks are underweight.  In addition to individual regions, individual industries can also be overweighted or underweighted.  There is also a black list of companies that are not invested in for ethical reasons.  These include, for example, energy suppliers such as Tata Power, companies that partially or exclusively manufacture armaments such as Lockheed Martin, Honeywell International, Airbus, Boeing, or tobacco companies.

When it comes to bond investments, the oil fund has so far invested seventy percent in government bonds and thirty percent in corporate bonds.  However, since a company's stocks and bonds are often closely linked, it was recently decided to only invest in government bonds.

The Norwegian oil fund is therefore based on an optimized mix of asset classes: around two thirds of it consists of stocks, one third of bonds, and some real estate is also mixed in.

The compound interest effect increases the fund's return.  The longer the investment horizon, the more it exploits its advantages.  In the case of the oil fund, income from interest and dividends is now higher than the new deposits.

A look at the oil fund's portfolio:

You've just heard that the oil fund invests in stocks, bonds and real estate.

Let's start with the equity investments.  At the end of 2019, around 71 percent of the fund's assets were invested in stocks.  The focus is on North America, followed by Europe.  Africa brings up the rear with less than one percent.

The focus of equity investments is therefore on large, developed economies.  But stocks from less developed emerging countries, the so-called emerging markets, are also included.  The equity quota here is 11 percent, because the emerging markets promise higher returns in the long term than the established countries, but the risk is also higher.  Smaller companies are also overweighted because, similar to emerging market stocks, they generate more returns on average.

At the end of 2019, around 26 percent of the fund's assets were invested in bonds.  A little more than half of them were government bonds.  Similar to stocks, bonds focus on North America and Europe.  But other countries and currencies are also mixed in, for example bonds in Japanese yen, Mexican peso or Brazilian real have been taken out.  The share of emerging markets is nine percent.

The remaining 43 percent are currently corporate bonds and covered bonds such as Pfandbriefe or similarly secured bonds.  However, as I said, the portfolio of corporate bonds is to be reduced in the future in favor of government bonds.

The creditworthiness, i.e. the creditworthiness of the bond debtors, is consistently high: only two percent of the bonds fall into the speculative area.

The third asset class that the oil fund invests in is real estate.  At the end of 2019, the volume invested in real estate was just under three percent.  Here the fund concentrates on office, logistics and retail properties in top cities such as New York, London, Paris and Munich.

The five principles of the Norwegian investment strategy:

The fund managers of the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund have not come up with a magic formula, but instead follow a series of investment guidelines, guidelines and rules.  We have put together for you the five most important principles of the Norwegian investment strategy.

First, there is the principle of passivity: invest passively and close to the index, which saves time and money.  The less fees you pay, the more income is left for you.

Second, there is diversification: the more you spread your wealth across different asset classes, the lower your risk of loss.  So take some time at the beginning to plan your strategy.  With the right mix of stocks, bonds and possibly real estate, choose an investment mix that suits your available assets and risk appetite.  Diversify within these asset classes according to geographic aspects.  Invest in both developed and developing countries, and by company size.  Overweight both emerging market stocks and smaller company stocks.  This way you can take advantage of opportunities and at the same time distribute your risk better.  About once a year you should restore your target quotas, i.e. rebalance.

Thirdly, we have the long-term investment horizon: Those who invest long-term can take more risks and thus generate a higher return.  Even if you are already retired, you should keep an equity stake.  Buy and hold, that is, buy and leave it alone, is more effective than trying to constantly chase after new trends.

Fourth, you should pay attention to consistency: what oil is to Norway, is your labor to you.  Invest a fixed amount every month, depending on your income, not the market situation.  If you earn more, increase your standing order.  This is also a better way of offsetting inflation.

And fifth, ethics also count: Pay attention to ethically correct, sustainable investments.  Violations of human rights, heavy pollution, arms manufacture, tobacco products or serious corruption are taboo for the oil fund.  For your private consumption, you can go a step further and only buy from companies that manufacture their goods ethically.

In short: invest long-term, regularly, sustainably, also diversified and index-based, and overweight shares of small companies and emerging markets as a return boost.

Build your personal future fund: The three levers for building private wealth

Now that we have taken a close look at the Norwegian oil fund, let's take a very practical look at how you as a private investor can implement the Norwegian strategy.  We take care of the three sub-areas stocks, bonds and real estate in turn.  But first, a few basic ideas about investing.

As already mentioned, there will be around 190,000 euros in the fund for every Norwegian in 2021.  If you want to save such a sum, there are various adjusting screws.

First of all, there is your investment horizon.  Following the Norwegian model, it should be an investment period of at least ten to fifteen years.  Even if you are about to retire, that doesn't mean that you need your money in one fell swoop.  You can pay out a monthly amount from your future fund instead of saving it further, a kind of private supplementary pension.

The second adjustment screw is your monthly savings rate.  How Much Money Can You Save?  Can you reduce fixed costs, do without what is superfluous or consume more consciously in order to invest this money in your future fund?  Do you already have securities or reserves in a call money or savings account?  You can also invest this money in your future fund.  If you earn more, you should increase the savings rate, at least by the rate of inflation.  Conversely, if you become unemployed, for example, you can lower your savings rate.

The third adjustment screw, the return, can only be influenced indirectly, namely through your asset class mix.  In addition to your personal perception of risk, it also depends on your investment horizon.  As a rule of thumb, subtract your age from 100, the sum corresponds to the share quota.  While as a thirty-year-old you invest seventy percent of your money in stocks, as a seventy-year-old you lower your risk with an equity ratio of thirty percent.  Of course, this also reduces the return.

The result, your saved wealth, results from the interaction of these three levers: investment horizon, monthly savings rate and return.

If you want to reach a certain amount, then it is important to start as early as possible.  This is also due to the compound interest effect.  The higher your return and the longer your investment horizon, the less you have to invest monthly.


Build your personal future fund: bonds

Now let's get into the construction kit of your personal future fund.  Our first pillar is bonds.  What can we learn from the Norwegians here?

Although the oil fund also invests worldwide in bonds, we limit ourselves to the most important currencies.  Because of their lower yield, currency fluctuations have a greater impact on bonds.  However, this is not a problem insofar as countries outside the eurozone also issue bonds in euros.

The prices of bonds also fluctuate, depending on the creditworthiness of the issuer, the remaining term and the interest rate level.  The oil fund tries to minimize this risk by only investing in government bonds with a maximum term of ten years.

An ETF savings plan is particularly useful if you are not yet very familiar with the capital market or if you cannot invest a lot of money.  ETFs, short for Exchange Traded Funds, are so-called index funds.  They replicate an index one to one;  this passive structure lowers costs, which in turn increases your return on investment.  You will remember: The oil fund also invests in line with the index.

For a bond quota similar to the Norwegian model, you should have a single ETF with a remaining term of no more than ten years that invests in government bonds that are denominated in euros.  You can find corresponding products on the website justetf.com.  For example the SPDR Bloomberg Barclays 7-10 Year Euro Government Bond ETF (ISIN IE00BYSZ5Z42).  Of course, you can also take ETFs with other maturities or other country focuses outside the euro zone.  Take a close look at the countries and maturities in which the ETF invests.  You can find this information, for example, on finance portals or on the websites of the providers.  The names alone do not always allow conclusions to be drawn about the content.

When it comes to sustainability, bond ETFs don't have much to offer at the moment.  So far there are only a few so-called green bonds.  You could, for example, buy a German government bond directly or a single green bond.  Rebalancing, i.e. aligning with your originally planned mix of assets, is usually easier with ETFs.

For your first fund pillar, the following applies: Government bonds that are denominated in euros and can be spread around the world contribute to stability.

So if you like it simple, you can tick off the bond issue with a single ETF.  It's more complicated with stocks.  For this, the topic of sustainability comes into play more strongly.

Build your personal future fund: stocks

So what can we learn from the Norwegians about stocks?  ETFs are also recommended here, with a maximum of twelve different ones.  The amounts per ETF should not be too small, otherwise this can increase the transaction costs.

The Norwegian Oil Fund invests worldwide, and that is what you should aim for for your equity exposure.  The following breakdown is recommended: 80 percent of industrialized market shares, 80 percent of which in large caps and 20 percent in small caps.  The 80 percent share of industrialized countries is distributed geographically as follows: 44 percent in North America, 44 percent in Europe and 12 percent in Asia and Oceania.  The remaining 20 percent of the equity stake is invested in emerging markets.  However, no further distinction is made here according to company size or region, as the diversification would otherwise be too confusing.

Are you still looking through  With a 70 percent equity component, this means, for example: 28 percent shares large caps North America, 28 percent shares large caps Europe, 8 percent shares large caps Asia and Oceania, 7 percent shares small caps North America, 7 percent shares small caps Europe, 2 percent shares  Small caps Asia and Oceania, 20 percent equities in emerging markets.  With a different share of shares, you can calculate the odds yourself using the above specifications.

For equity ETFs, you should prefer replicating over synthetic ones.  Replicating ETFs actually buy the share packages that are available in the fund, weighted according to the index, while synthetic ETFs artificially replicate the index via swap transactions.

On justetf.com you can filter funds by country, company size and all sorts of other criteria in order to replicate your future fund based on the Norwegian model.  You are of course flexible with the number of ETFs, but with seven you can map the Norwegian portfolio quite well.  If you are still at the very beginning of your future fund, you can first approach the optimal composition with fewer ETFs.  For industrialized countries, for example, you could use the UBS MSCI World SRI (ISIN LU0629459743) and for emerging markets the iShares MSCI EM SRI (ISIN IE00BYVJRP78).

In the two ETFs mentioned, ethical and moral aspects are taken into account, as you can usually see from the abbreviations SRI for socially responsible investment or ESG for environmental social governance.  Sometimes the providers work with negative lists, sometimes they pursue a best-in-class approach.  The latter means that they only invest in the most exemplary companies in an industry, such as the oil giant Total.  The approaches are not yet perfect, but they are still an important step towards sustainable investing.

Globally diversified stocks should make up the main part of your future fund; their higher returns mean that currency fluctuations are less significant in the long term.

We have now ticked off the two most important asset classes, stocks and bonds.  The question of adding real estate remains.

Build your personal future fund: real estate

The third pillar makes it a little more difficult for us.  That is why we do not start with the question of how, but start much more fundamentally with the question: real estate, yes or no?

Why?  Well, the oil fund invests a maximum of seven percent of its assets in directly held commercial real estate in prime locations.  As a private investor, you can forget that.  Even if you want to implement the real estate quota in the form of owner-occupied residential property, you would have to be a multiple millionaire to catch up with the oil fund.

Basically, you should clarify for yourself whether you want to have a property you use yourself or not.  If your answer is yes, forget about the strategic real estate quota.  Just be aware that the money you put into a property cannot be invested in your future fund at the same time.  Think not only of possible increases in the value of your property, but also of ancillary purchase costs, maintenance costs and mortgage interest.  You will only know afterwards what you will use to generate a better return, the property or your future fund.

Alternatively, you can invest smaller amounts in real estate using real estate ETFs or REITs.  The latter is short for Real Estate Investment Trust, which are public companies that earn their money with real estate.  The specialty of REITs is that they distribute a large part of their profits.  As with other investments, you should reinvest this income in order to use the compound interest effect for you.  An example of a real estate ETF with a focus on “industrialized countries” is the iShares Developed Markets Property Yield ETF (ISIN IE00B1FZS350).

To put it in a nutshell: real estate is immobile.  Therefore, think carefully about whether and in what form real estate should be part of your future fund.

Okay, did you understand?  Then get started: Open an online account, set up a savings plan that corresponds to your desired risk-return mix, and make sure to rebalance at least once a year.  Then you too can get rich like Norway.


Too long, didn’t read:

Let's sum it up again: The Norwegian Oil Fund is investing its money in the future.  It only uses stocks, bonds and, to a small extent, real estate.  Its success is based on an optimal risk-return mix, low costs, a long-term perspective and the consideration of sustainability.  The fund is completely transparent: both its strategy and its individual investments can be viewed on the Internet.

This is exactly what you can take advantage of as a private investor.  In order to put together your personal future fund based on the Norwegian model, first decide on the mix of assets that is right for you.  Then find suitable ETFs and set up a monthly savings plan.  With a long-term investment horizon and annual rebalancing, your returns should ultimately be as successful as Norway’s oil.",Invest like the Norwegian Oil Fund,,

However, if you live in country A with currency A, and buy a world tracker instrument in country B with currency B, will this cancel out the diversification effects, as my purchase would now be subject to swings between currency A and B?

31,2021-05-23 14:34:29,t3_nj8yzp,nj8yzp,investing,"To help give the framework of my thought process, I'll use this example: 

-- I purchase $XYZ stock at a share price of $45.00/unit.    
-- $XYZ pays an annual dividend of 3.8%    
-- **For simplicity, let's assume the stock price holds at $45/unit for eternity with no dividend cuts or increases**    
-- Annual yield = 3.8% x $45.00 = $1.71/year

-- If I earn a return of $1.71/year, I should be able to recover my original principle price of $45/unit over time    
-- $45 / $1.71 = 26.31 years

Therefore, based on the above example, I would make the argument that in **26.31 years my annual dividend returns will total $45/unit based on an annual return of 3.8% without change in stock price.**

Is this line of thinking correct?    
Am I overlooking something simple?    
Will the same principle hold for 100 shares? 1,000 shares?

**If this is correct, then why don't we all invest in dividend stocks?** It seems if you are working on any type of 20+-year horizon there is the guarantee of the stock nearly paying for itself. This doesn't even mention the re-investment of dividends or the possibility of dividend increases over that period! _It almost seems to easy...?_

To save some time, I note these drawbacks/limitations to my line of thought:    
1) Dividends can be cut (and they often are!)    
2) Share price can be depressed, in turn impacting dividend yield potential significantly over time    
3) Stock dilution (seems unlikely as most dividend paying firms are stable/blue-chip type companies)    
4) Time in market (hypothesis needs a longer timeframe to play out)


This all seems too simple - please poke some holes in my logic. Thanks in advance!",Is it an oversimplification to state: Dividend-yielding stocks will pay for themselves over time? (assuming no dividend cuts over the period held),,

With the increase of renewable energy power systems are gonna face an interesting problem: negative price. 

Negative price is the situation where there is a non flexible demand and a strong non flexible offer. 

In other words, it is becoming very common situation in which the production from renewable is high and at the same time conventional resources like nuclear power or gas power are kept on because the cost of temporary shutting down plants is costly. 

This is a global problem. Countries around the world have been or are gonna be experienced.

Basically they say that shorting is selling a currency pair, where the you expect the ""base"" currency to fall in value. For example, this breakdown by IG: https://www.ig.com/us/trading-strategies/learn-how-to-short-a-currency-190712

But that's the end of their explanation. How does merely selling a currency pair result in a profit? Where and when are you realizing a profit?

Say you start with $10,000 USD, you short the USD, and you're right and it falls in value during the relevant period. Where's your profit coming from in this scenario? Tangibly, how do you end up having more than $10,000 in the bank when it's over? 

For stocks, shorting is supposed to involve ""borrowing"" shares of stock, selling them, waiting for the drop, and then buying and returning the shares to whomever lended them to you. (I have no idea how one borrows shares of stock, but apparently it's a thing.) The explanations for shorting forex don't mention any comparable process of borrowing, selling, and re-buying the currency. So how do you profit in the forex case?

Regarding RH PFOF -

I noticed after Q3 of last year RH stopped reporting venue-specific information in their [Held NMS Stocks and Options Order Routing Public Report](https://cdn.robinhood.com/assets/robinhood/legal/RHS%20SEC%20Rule%20606a%20and%20607%20Disclosure%20Report%20Q3%202020.pdf)

In [Q4](https://cdn.robinhood.com/assets/robinhood/legal/RHS%20SEC%20Rule%20606a%20and%20607%20Disclosure%20Report%20Q4%202020.pdf) and [since](https://cdn.robinhood.com/assets/robinhood/legal/RHF%20SEC%20Rule%20606%20and%20607%20Disclosure%20Q1%202021.pdf) any venue-specific information is all listed under Robinhood Securities LLC.

I'm not looking for any conspiracies I'm just wondering if there is some sort of loophole RH found in lack of necessity to list entity-specific execution services by using an umbrella company, or if SEC regulation changed.

It's a question purely out of curiosity, I was wondering since the [C&D](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2020/33-10906.pdf) settlement if it made public information specific toward particular stocks/assets with it's PFOF dependent on the service, i.e. if there were divisions dependent on certain assets/order types being directed or non-directed. (Directed meaning RH as customer as obviously it ~~isn't~~ wasn't necessarily a concern for it's actual customers until then).

My theory is that if RH does indeed have crypto holdings these orders would be of asset class that would not perhaps be sourced through a third party-executor.

**Edit:** The report discrepancies were between Robinhood Securities LLC - Held NMS Stocks & Robinhood Financial. This is the [2021 Q1 RH Securities](https://cdn.robinhood.com/assets/robinhood/legal/RHS%20SEC%20Rule%20606%20and%20607%20Disclosure%20Q1%202021.pdf) report.

In my search, I found a company called Arbor, which is a REIT with a very juicy dividend yield (7.86%). Usually, dividend yields this high are when the company stock falls due to a bad future outlook, and it's expected that the company might have to cut its dividends soon, but that's not the case here — $ABR has been steadily growing for years. 

I tried to read a bit more about this company, but I feel like I'm lacking the knowledge to understand what's it doing to be growing so much. It's a REIT that specializes in mortgages, but I thought this kind of stuff got less popular after 2008? Is it super risky?

It's not discussed very much on the internet, most articles I saw about it seem auto-generated from templates and mostly about the stock price (like [this one](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-arbor-realty-trust-abr-is-a-great-momentum-stock-to-buy-2021-03-17)). 

Some more useful info I found:

- [comparison of mREITs](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4398102-you-are-considering-mortgage-reits-you-must-read-this) on seeking alpha which does not discuss Arbor much, but other mREIT stocks it mentions (like $STWD, $BXMT, $ACRE, and $LADR) while having similar yield, don't have similar stock price growth;
- [this Q1 2021 call transcript](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/07/arbor-realty-trust-abr-q1-2021-earnings-call-trans/) that I read but couldn't understand much of the terms used there. GSE? AIR? build-to-rent?
- I also had a look at their [2020 yearly report](https://ir.arbor.com/static-files/747cdfcd-0579-4126-8b1b-19ebec102cad), but I don't know how to read and understand that stuff properly... ""2020 numbers are better than 2019 numbers""?

As far as I can tell, the only reason it hasn't risen is because European nations have had a much more difficult time recovering travel-wise. Different restrictions to countries, as well as the British government putting the United States on the red-list because of a high COVID danger, means that they can't generate as much revenue.

* COIN stock rises 3.0% in premarket trading.
* Sets price target at $306; implies a 36% upside potential for stock based on Friday's closing price of $224.35.
* Nance also likes COIN's leverage to an ecosystem with strong growth driven by increasing adoption of digital currencies, its consumer platform with strong customer acquisition trends and rapidly growing institutional business, and its opportunities to add additional features and capabilities.
* Though the continued success or failure of crypto as an asset class will ultimately determine COIN's future, ""we believe COIN represents a blue-chip way through with to invest in the development of the ecosystem,"" the analyst writes.

And furthermore ""inflation is now again the biggest risk for markets,"" as initially identified by 35% of the survey's 194 respondents who manage a combined $592 billion worth of assets. But if investors are broadly concerned about inflation, it suggests stock prices are likely already reflecting these risks and investors have discounted, or priced in, inflation risk into the markets. While it may not be a perfect analog, it's worth considering what happened during the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. 

On March 17, 2020, BofA's Global Fund Manager Survey identified ""Coronavirus"" as its biggest tail risk, and it remained on the top fo the list for the next 10 months as data consistently and persistently reflected an economy in a state of emergency. But the S&P 500 prices bottomed on March 23, 2020. 

In other words, the market had priced in the coronavirus recession and discounted the pandemic's worst financial impacts by mid-March, but this risk still remained the consensus worry among investors for another year. 

The threat of inflation is the most known risk in the markets right now. And so investors should consider the likelihood that the downside of inflation has been priced in.

""Unlike recent cycles, we acknowledge that inflation tail-risk is higher and that inflation data could get hotter before normalizing,"" JPMorgan's Dubravko Lakos-Bujas said. ""This outcome, at the same time, is getting increasingly priced-in as essentially every investor we have spoken to in recent weeks is well aware of this backdrop.""

According to Google, search interest in ""inflation"" is at an all-time high. The University of Michigan's recent survey of consumers revealed sentiment got dinged in May due to unusually elevated concerns about inflation in the years to come.

On the corporate side, a record number of S&P 500 (^GSPC) companies have discussed ""inflation"" on earnings calls as executives just can't stop talking about higher costs.

Whether or not inflation actually becomes a major problem for the economy will only be known in hindsight. And despite folks arguing that recent upticks in price represent ""transitory"" concerns and ""reopening quirks,"" this debate is likely to rage on for months especially as high-profile skeptics sound alarms.

# What to expect next

The issue of greenhouse gas emissions will continue to concern regulators in Europe and around the world. It will also lead to additional laws and regulations that will affect companies, particularly in the fields of energy, industry and manufacturing, and aviation.

[On May 24–25, the European Council will convene for a special meeting](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/european-council/2021/05/24-25/) to discuss the issue of climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, and provide further guidance on the issue. It is likely that the meeting will have an impact on the price of carbon.

[Analysts disagree about the rate of growth in the price of carbon](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/18/why-europes-carbon-market-is-experiencing-a-boom-like-never-before.html), Some claim it will continue to climb throughout the year to levels of over 100 euros per tonne, and some claim it will stabilize at around 40 in the coming year but will grow slowly until it at least doubles by the end of the decade.

It is worth following the reports and new regulations from government bodies in Europe and around the world, and pay attention to any new regulation that will directly affect Carbon activity and price.

As a result of the jump in the price of carbon, it is likely that we will see changes in companies that produce gas emissions. Especially from the energy-production, and aviation sectors, as well as the growth of companies that offer greener solutions.

[In addition, last year, China, too, committed ](https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/china-considers-going-carbon-neutral-peaking-emissions/)to significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and will reach Net-Zero Emissions by 2060.

52,2021-05-24 23:19:11,t3_nkb976,nkb976,investing,"Anyone see the WSJ article this morning about CLOs? How risky is this situation? What is the SEC/banking industry doing to regulate their creditworthiness and composition? How much exposure do certain institutions have? Definitely seems to be a potential risk and harken back to the 05-08 debt obligation scheme. Would love to hear people’s thoughts on this.

https://www.wsj.com/articles/issuance-of-bundles-of-risky-loans-jumps-to-16-year-high-11621849782?st=qa4geofs0ogon3s&reflink=article_copyURL_share",Collateralized Loan Obligations - CLOs,,
53,2021-05-25 00:47:14,t3_nkcyw3,nkcyw3,investing," **Two things to start:**

1. I am not a financial advisor. What follows in my interpretation after doing much research and consulting with my broker. Consult yours before making any decisions.
2. I own 102,500 shares currently. I really don't care if they go up or down over the next few weeks. They will be worth the same regardless as I plan to hold until the Bankruptcy exit plan is concluded unless the price breaks $12.

**Now, what you came here for:** How much will I be paid for my shares of Hertz when Hertz executes its exit plan?

**There a 3 parts of the pay out:**

**1)** You will be paid $1.53 cash for each share, plus

**2)** Each shareholder will get an equity distribution on a prorated bases of 3% of the total purchase price of the entire company. Roughly $1.00 per share, plus

**3)** Then there are the warrants. A little complicated, but hope you follow. Exact wording from the agreement: ""Each Eligible Existing Hertz Shareholder, has the right, but not the obligation, subject to and in accordance with the Rights Offering Procedures, to be eligible to subscribe for up to one (1) Rights Offering Share per 0.9554 shares of Existing Hertz Parent Interests that it holds, at a purchase price of $10.00 per share, subject to the individual limits included in the calculations in Item 2 of this Subscription Form."" So for example on 100 shares you would get (100/.9554) = 104.6682018002931. Which becomes 104 warrants because all rounding is down downward. Each warrant can then be purchased for $10. Here is the tricky part. You can convert by exercising the warrant, or you can sell the warrant itself. For this example we are going to sell the warrant. And here is why nobody can give you a concrete answer because the value of the warrant is COMPLETE SPECULATION. For my example I am going to assume that the new Hertz, with its reduced debt structure and red hot rental market, will get back to a pre-pandemic level of $20 per share. So you could sell each warrant for a $10 profit. ($20 share price less the $10 warrant purchase.) *Just a note: HTZ traded for as high as $46/share in the good times, which is what the new HTZ will be entering. The good times. Low debt. Hot market.*

**So here is the math on 100 shares:**

1. $1.53 cash out (x) 100 = $153 **+**
2. $1.00 equity distribution (x) 100 = $100 **+**
3. 104 shares times $10 profit **=** $1040

Total income from you 100 shares would be $153 + $100 + $1040 = $1293. or **$12.93/share.**

If you currently owned the 100 shares for todays close price of $6.39 you investment is $639.

So staying it thru until the exit plan concludes and selling your warrants would net you $654 ($1293-$639).

**This is why I say I'm a bull on this stock. I believe that the total value of each HTZGQ share is really somewhere between $13-$20 per share. I will not sell unless the $HTZGQ crosses the $12 line before the exit plan is executed. Most estimates you see assume being able to modestly sell your warrants for about $15 per share. Which means a price of around $7-8 ($1.53+$1+$5 warrant profit=$7.53) is the total value. I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A SEVERE UNDERVALUE.**

***But regardless, lets just say that the $7-8 is the call. you have a more than 20% upside in the current price of $6.39.***

I find it insane to group up all companies below X PE and call it value investing, if you don't wish to do the picking you can buy shares of funds managed in the spirit of value investing.

Value indexes usually use more metrics like price to book, dividend yield, etc. It's not just raw P/E, or something as simple as a company doing a required goodwill impairment causing negative GAAP earnings in one quarter would kick them off the index.

It's not the smartest indexing, but in general value investing has outperformed the SP500 historically.

Value doesn't necessarily mean dying. If you look at the top 10 holdings of VTV, for example, the only one you might be able to call ""dying"" would be Exxon Mobil, but that's if you're genuinely convinced that we're going to transition away from oil as a society in the near future. They could also have a lot of upside of oil prices keep rising.

114,2021-05-25 20:41:46,t1_gzfo7ex,,investing,"Pure speculation on my part that it's related to Merrill Edge's revenue model.

Many brokers generate a lot of their revenue from net interest income. Some brokers also generate income from payment for order flow (pfof). Merrill Edge is one of the brokers that doesn't  sell order flow although they get rebates from exchanges and they may make a market as well. And there are other revenue areas as well. 

ETFs can pay a distribution fee - similar in concept to 12b-1 fees for mutual funds. To reduce fees, I recall reading that ETFs may have been reducing their fees to brokers - at least I don't see those expenses listed on ETFs.

So perhaps, Merrill Edge prefers to offer the mutual fund equivalents which offer a 12b-1 fee instead of the actively managed ETF.

I took a look at $ntsx and some of the Avantis ETFs that you mentioned. They are low volume and low net asset so blocking these funds really would have little to no impact to Merrill.

Of course - that's just a wild guess. It could be an entirely different reason. For example - I did a search on blocked ETFs on Merrill Edge. The one thing that I noticed was that blocked ETFs tended to be low net asset active ETFs regardless of the fund family or asset class - so that kinda kills my idea that it could be revenue related since I'm guessing that ETFs in the same fund family probably costs the same to process and generate similar revenue.  Ie - Pimco active bond ETFs are all available on Merrill Edge except for $emnt which has net assets under 200MM.

134,2021-05-25 21:01:49,t1_gzfqrow,,investing,"Value investing is about present and projected cashflow in relation to price, looking for those that are mispriced. Value indexing is made from picking companies at the opposite ends of a classification based on a handful of metrics. [Here's](http://www.crsp.org/files/Equity-Indexes-Methodology-Guide_0.pdf#page=37) how they make the underlying index to VTV, basically put stocks on a scale of PE/PB/PS/div ratios for value, future and historic growth/ROA for growth and chop the middle. Sure, Exxon gets in that package and I'm sure a great many companies, but I'm not sure there is denying that it will also include the low/no-growth companies that the market values poorly. Going for something as simple as <X PB worked in the time of Graham, but we are no longer in those times and throwing in a few more metrics and a cute multi-parameter model to automate the process (or even better, a Monte Carlo simulation [^TM](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/tesla-price-target-2/), but I digress) doesn't solve the issue of such an oversimplification.

I'm not saying that I necessarily see them as baskets of dead companies (although it is written like that), I just don't see how indexing accomplishes the same role as value investing. I'm sure there is plenty of correlation between the aggregate performance of both since the latter are more likely to converge on stocks within those bounds then the one set for growth indexes, but I'd be shocked if any value investor would be interested in buying everything in that band (tho I'd be curious to hear if there is, as long as it's not the guy giving a Google Talk on his atrociously performing fund using a low-CAPE strategy based on theory and access to OPM). Besides, the orthogonality set by those ETF-sellers between value and growth is a bit funny and seemingly [irreconcilable with the philosophy](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/1992.html) (CTRL-F to ""fuzzy thinking""), but I guess selling ""low-growth"" ETFs has less of a ring to it... and who doesn't want to make a 0.04% commission on capital from an automated process (nonetheless, bless Vanguard and Mr. Bogle, of course).

>value investing has outperformed the SP500 historically

Perhaps, so how do you reconcile that with the under performance of value indexes? Sure a bull-market is not the best playground for value investors, but VV slaughtered VTV on all accounts and there's a gaping bear market in the middle of their history. VTV had a slightly worse drawdawn in '08 and a slower recovery thereafter. The only over performance I see from VTV is in the ramp up from 2004 to 2008. If you do this exercise with BRK and SPY, you'll find BRK under-performed in 2002-08 and over-performed for the drawdawn and recovery (as you'd expect per Buffett's own but ancient letters).",,gzfqrow,t1_gzfipk5

1. The value at which an ETF is trading, is it the sum of the share's market value divided by the number of ETF shares? If not, should it be?
2. Do ETF issuers usually post news to changes that they make to the constituents of the ETF? For example, an accumulating ETF reinvests. It would be nice for this to be announced as opposed to me keeping track of the data that can be obtained from the issuer's website.
3. I'm having trouble understanding the fundamental concept of the value a stock has. When you buy a stock you own a small part of the company. Assuming you're long the stock, you expect the company to grow and profit from that. However, when the company grows you don't actually share in the growth, since you don't share the companies profit. The only thing you (can) get is dividends, which is a fraction of the share's value. Alternatively you sell the share at the current (higher) value to someone else, but given what I said above, the higher value of the stock doesn't directly net you more significant more returns, so why is the value of the stock higher in the first place?

The idea is that prices are somewhat dictated by analysts that look at these details, and you're just buying market cap weights of companies that fit the value criteria.

What going with value indexes instead of overall market cap weighted funds is avoiding overhyped growth stocks.

IMO in the current market where you have unprofitable companies like Coinbase and RBLX trading at 50x revenues, value is a good way to avoid much of the overvalued hype. If you invested in value before the tech bubble crash, you wouldn't have even lost money while the NASDAQ dropped 75%.

The problem is growth is at some point the growth is priced in, perhaps a little too much. If growth companies don't grow as fast as anticipated, they can lose a lot of value.

I actually do VYM and VIG for my taxable brokerage. Both provide me some income I can either reinvest or spend. VYM is usually oriented towards large cap value. VIG is more of a blend, but it's criteria of rising dividends gives exposure to growing companies that actually target profitability like Microsoft and Visa, rather than growth at all cost stocks like Tesla.

The reason I do VYM/VIG instead of VTV mainly for liquidity reasons. I can have cash flow every 3 months and not worry too much about the underlying price fluctuations.",,gzfrjgn,t1_gzfqrow

It's easy to save and/or invest money when you have money to save/invest. Meaning, no debt to service.

Imagine how much cash one would have if they didn't have to:

- Pay Student Loans.
- Pay a car payment.
- Pay Rent/Mortgage because you inherited a home or live in a parent's extra home. Bonus if you collect rent from roomates and use it to supplement your income (seen this happen several times).
- Pay high interest credit card debt (credit cards are use for points and convenience, not as a cash buffer between checks)

Then there are little things that add up:

- Paying cash for phones instead of getting the ""free"" phone when you sign a contract.
- Great advice from day-1 from parents about finances. This is invaluable. Many of us learn financial literacy the hard way.
- Lower interest rates on everything because all of the above usually results in better credit rating.

It led to a spike today, which is unfortunate because I just got turned on to Coinbase today for a completely different reason that had nothing to do with these analyst ratings.  


About two weeks ago someone I know was talking about cryptocurrencies and how he wanted to buy Telcoin, but didn't know how to.  He came to me for help since he thinks I'm some kind of techno wizard that knows how to do it.  Newsflash, I knew nothing about how to buy crypto currencies of any kind.  It was total black hole to me.  So for the last couple of weeks I've been reading articles and watching YouTube videos on how to do it, more out of a place of understanding than from wanting to invest heavily.  What I came away with after spending some time looking into it is that the whole crypto exchange is a racket.  They take fees at literally every step of the buying/selling process.  You want to buy some Bitcoin?  Great, there's a .5% maker fee.  Oh, you want to sell your Bitcoin?  Great, there's a .5% taker fee.  Oh and there is also a flat fee they take no matter what.  But lets say you want to exchange your Bitcoins you bought (for a fee) into some other crypto currency like Ethereum?  You guessed it... MORE FEES!!!!!  Reminds me of that old SNL skit about the coin bank (no pun intended) that makes change.  You give them a dollar, they'll give you four quarters.  When asked how the bank will make money, the manager replies ""Volume"".  :-)  


Right now it seems like the price of the stock is tied at the hip to the price of Bitcoin.  But based on what I've seen they shouldn't be.  The more people that are buying and selling, the better it is for Coinbase..... its all about volume.  I would think volatility in the crypto market would actually be a boon to these guys, because you will get the paper handed folks selling and the long-term hold folks buying the dip.    


I feel like the company will be fine as long as crypto is popular.  But I'm no financial advisor and I've been wrong many many times, so I would love to know what you all think about crypto in general.

However, you must note that my point was you did not actually refute Cathy’s points or approach AGAIN. The appeal to your personal authority demonstrates the absence of something to refute it other then (potentially valid) comments against Cathy’s character. 

Paul Graham has an essay / model on the hierarchy of the quality of disagreements that might be worth referencing. https://bennorton.com/grahams-hierarchy-of-disagreement-and-internet-arguments/ 

Fundamentally, my comprehension is Cathy is trying to take a venture backed model (a portfolio of ‘early stage’, publicly listed firms) with an ETF as a wrapper, in fields where technology implies magnitude stepwise changes that have not been appropriately priced into the market. I’d be curious what sectors you hold, if you are purely limited to public equities/securities and how your approach fairs in this next business cycle.

The more people that are buying and selling, the better it is for Coinbase..... its all about volume. I would think volatility in the crypto market would actually be a boon to these guys, because you will get the paper handed folks selling and the long-term hold folks buying the dip.

Volume is positively correlated with price over time. Sure, you'll have massive volumes on huge dump days, but in a multi-year bear market, volumes shrink significantly. Bear markets end when there are essentially no more sellers any more. If you're going to own COIN, I think you have to gain comfort with the fact that their revenues/profits are very much tied to the cycles of the crypto space.

As a side note, Coinbase needs to beef up their systems to handle the high-volume days better. They could've earned more fees from me, but their site crashed on May 12 so I was unable to buy the dip until the BTC price had already rallied 11K from the bottom.

What equity investors might be not seeing is that LTMAQ is under chapter 11 and its bonds are in default, still the sr unsec ones are trading around 95% of par. So, the laws in Chile and in the whole Latin America is way different that US bankruptcy laws. Last week I saw one news comparing LATAM Airlines situation as the new HERTZ where equity jumped from 1 to 6 usd once they restructured the company. The price action can be similar but the reasons will be different. There is now way that shareholders will loose its company to unsecured creditors, not in any Emerging Market country. So, if bonds are trading close to 100% of its par, why the equity is still between 25 - 30% of pre covid levels? Probably they will swap this debt into some convertible bond which in the end you might get diluted as an equity holder, but still I would assume at least 5 usd for this stock even in the event of a dilution, because we will be talking about a leader company in the region well positioned for the recovery and free of debt.

The point is when you make strategies based on economic theory and what should be happening ur very prone to blowing up. In theory implied volatility is regularly higher than realized volatility but shorting volatility has a grave yard of people in it. Funds like Renaissance and DE Shaw run strategies that are much shorter term and thus more statistically significant and they also exercise world class risk management and are hyper aware of assumptions they make when they have models that last longer time frames.

Recently paid off all my debt short of my mortgage, and at the age of 34 I'm just now starting my retirement contributions.  
  
Yesterday I made a Vanguard account and will be making $500/mo automatic contributions into an IRA for the rest of my working life. In addition to this, I'm adding about $25k cash to the account as a jump-start in long-term index funds. I am not trying to win the lotto or play games with Crypto/GME. I just don't want to live off Social Security when I'm 67. I'm self-employed so my income comes and goes in waves, but my realistic goal is to contribute 15-20% of my gross annually for the next 35-ish years.  
  
Upon research, VTSAX seems to be the golden boy for the long game, but VTI has a .01% lower fee to it, and doesn't have the $3000 minimum purchase.

I don't know what they specialize in or where their revenue comes from but their calculators are probably going on the decline.

If you need a more sophisticated calculator a rudimentary search on the web will usually yield an online calculator or a program you can use. Why buy or rent a calculator for several hundred when there are incredibly cheap or even free online alternatives. They might begin looking at other similar markets: Small, low power isolated devices. Whatever those might end up being. As for automotives? I didn't even know they did stuff like that. If the trend continues vehicles are going to need more electronic componenets, and the systems needed to better interact with, maintain and construct these vehicles will also consequentially be more electronic in nature, like

2 Daily ETF holdings are public so you can check for changes youself, or even script it. I hear ARK sends emails about their trades. Maybe others do as well but I don't think it's common. Or you can check if their underlying index provider has an email service. I'm not sure what the point of announcing a non-change like reinvesting dividends in an accumulating fund would be.  

3 You own the company and when the company grows, you do share in the profit. You don't have a majority say in how that profit is used, only a minority share.  

For some mature stocks which aren't able to grow as much and don't do buybacks, the dividend is often going to be the main form of returns. But generally a company's earnings can also be allocated for shareholder benefit in other ways. You may find it helpful to see a stock as an unsellable stake in a tangible small business. You benefit when the company pays you explicitly and you may benefit more when the business retains some earnings to grow and be able to pay you more in the future. In some cases you may need to invest more capital into the business for several years before it can start to pay off.   

Then add on the ability to sell that stake to others when you need cash now in a liquid market to others who don't. The stock price is not just a mirror of the business in its current state; it is the expected future cashflows of the business discounted to present value at a rate that depends on how much the marginal buyers and sellers prefer money now vs more later and how much risk they are willing to take.

My spouse and I are in our mid 40s. We sold a piece of real estate and are wondering where we will get the best results: pay off a big chunk of our mortgage and take years off the loan and save tons on interest or invest it hoping for bigger payout over time? The stock market is increasingly volatile which could mean great returns(and risks). We do not need the money for another 15 years, but want it to work for us in the meantime. We already have a decent retirement spread over a 401K, and a diverse, though USA, stock portfolio.

In general, QE has minimal impact on inflation and requires private banks to make loans (something they're not doing alot of today).

I'm also not sure how government liabilities impact inflation.  In my mind this is deflationary.

If you're worried about inflation PPP loans and fiscial spend are the only policies of concern.

Back to your question. I see no catalyst for long term inflation.  In the short term, will see price hikes, attributed to the reopening, but the forces of demographics, technology, globalization will keep inflation down, as it has since the 70s.  If you don't agree, that a look at Japan.

BASIC COMPANY INFORMATION

Lockheed Martin is aerospace and defence company which provides very high-end military equipment. Aircraft is where they particularly shine with the F-35 accounting for about 30% of the company's revenue.

The lion's share of the company's revenue comes the united states government. Most of all aircraft used by the air force comes from this one company.

CEO INFORMATION

Lockheed recently announced in 2020 a new CEO to run the company. His name is Jim Taiclet .While having several years of experience with Lockheed, his previous experience as CEO was not with another defense company.

Most of his career was spent running the successful REIT known as American Tower (AMT). The company has been very successful both during and after his tenure. (Which is another great dividend growth company I might add).

https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/who-we-are/leadership-governance/james-taiclet-joins-lockheed-martin-president-ceo.html

DIVIDEND HISTORY/SAHRE BUYBACKS

Quarterly Payout (At A Glance)
2020 - $2.60
2019 - $2.40
2018 - $2.20
2017 - $2.00
2016 - $1.82
2015 - $1.65

Dividend Yield = 2.68%

Payout Ratio = ~40% (Very Safe)

Let me start be saying that this company is EXTREMELY  profitable. The company is currently on an 18 year consecutive dividend streak. Not to mention the company buys back BILLIONS of its own stock year in and year out. I fully expect this company to be a dividend aristocrat in a few years.

The dividend yield is about double that of the S&P as of today and only has a Payout Ratio of about 40%. This means that not only does this company has a good yield while buying back stock, but this company can EASILY afford to maintain and RAISE the dividend over time dramatically.

https://investors.lockheedmartin.com/stock-information/dividend-history

MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS

The company has a long history of M&A activity and the most recent example of this Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD). This is yet another example of the company using its financial fortress of a balance sheet and exemplary cash flows to acquire other businesses.

AJRD is a space and aeronautics company which could potentially extend more deals with NASA and the U.S. government. This was recently announced about six months ago in December 2020 and is likely to finalize in 2021.

https://news.lockheedmartin.com/2020-12-20-Lockheed-Martin-to-Acquire-Aerojet-Rocketdyne-Strengthening-Position-as-Leading-Provider-of-Technologies-to-Deter-Threats-and-Help-Secure-the-United-States-and-its-Allies

FINANCIAL INFORMATION

The company has incredible financials. The balance sheet is a financial fortress. The debt load is very controllable. Cash flows continue to pour in record numbers year after year and 2021 guidance issued by the company expects record revenue and record EPS for the year. 

The Biden administration just issued an increase in defense spending of about ~1% earlier this year. All the more reason for this company's financials to continue to stay healthy. Financials linked below....

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LMT/balance-sheet/

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LMT/cash-flow?p=LMT

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LMT/financials?p=LMT

GROWTH STORY MOVING FORWARD

LMT is expected to grow top-line revenue numbers 4.50% in 2021 and 3.70% in 2022. Earnings per share for  the company in 2020 finished at $24.58. This is expected to grow to $26.68 in 2021 and $27.90 in 2022.

Contracts are usually signed many years in advance. Revenues can be easily forcasted for the next several years due to the timelines of the contracts. Furthermore, innovation is not only encouraged, but expected by shareholders AND the united states military is order for our nation to maintain relevant in terms of weaponry.

New age military equipment is usually pretty ""hush-hush"" on what is in the works but Lockheed Martin does disclose some of these new products including technologies such as new highly intelligent drones, missile systems, and even targeted lasers.

One thing is for sure, the military will continue come out with bigger and badder weapons. Who will likely be selling it to them? Probably good ole LMT.

Newer acquisitions such as the recent AJRD deal allows Lockheed to also focus on other products in the space category and is another wildcard with some potential.

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LMT/analysis?p=LMT

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE/ BARRIER TO ENTRY

If you were given 10 million dollars, and your goal was to create a globally recognized soda brand, could you get it done? Maybe. What about 10 million to create a social media platform? Also a maybe. But could you start a aeronautics and/or defence company with 10 million budget? Absolutely not.

The regulations are incredibly strict. The demand for capital is VERY HIGH with projects frequently running into the billions of dollars. Switching from one business to another poses risks for the government and our military and are usually avoided.

This makes the U.S. government very loyal and sticky to LMT business and this is very likely to continue. While there are competitors in the space....Lockheed continues to dominate this market.

VALUATION (WHY IT'S A GREAT BUY IMO)

As mentioned earlier, the company is expected to produce $27.90 in EPS in 2022. Based of of today's price of $390, this gives this company a forward PE ratio of ~13.9. This is an EXTREMELY low forward PE ratio for a company putting up record numbers and dominating the market that it operates in. 

This is even more impressive considering it's still off a fair amount from it's previous all time highs. I am very bullish and this is one of my largest positions. I am not remotely interested in selling. I am buying at these prices or really anything even close to these levels. I wouldn't sell a share if this company were to go to $800 a share tomorrow morning.

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LMT/analysis?p=LMT

RISK FACTORS TO CONSIDER

Almost all revenue comes from one customer (the government). It is steady and consistent but if the government were to fall out of love with Lockheed then this company would be negatively impacted.

There aren't many who could take down LMTs throne but their main competitor is Boeing. Boeing has the capital and leverage to compete with Lockheed Martin long term.

This company is susceptible to a number of different geopolitical risks. Conflicts with other countries could be both a Negative AND a positive for Lockheed.

The current political climate is leaning harder and harder towards a more relaxed defence budget.

&#x200B;

Currently I am a Senior Loan Officer at a small credit union in the Northeast US. I basically do everything except traditional mortgages: loans, accounts, business loans/accounts, home equity loans,  etc. We partner with an investment firm where we send members who are interested in IRA's, stocks, bonds, estate planning, etc. We offer our own IRA's, but those aren't tied to any investments so they're essentially glorified savings accounts with the tax benefits. So I always refer everyone to them for a true investment IRA. 

&#x200B;

I've recently wanted to start getting into investment advising in addition to my traditional SLO role. I love helping people and this would be another way I can do that. However, I don't know where to start. I know enough about the basics of investing (Roth vs Traditional IRA, how mutual funds work, what the S&P 500 is, etc) but far from an expert. I've heard about an SIE exam as a good entry point, and then the Series 66 and 7 exams, but I'm not exactly sure what they consist of. 

&#x200B;

Any investment professionals that can weigh in and give me any insight would be appreciated. I'm looking for any good apps/websites/resources that I can start with the basics (and I mean VERY basics) and start to grow my knowledge. Also, knowing what courses/tests to take, and what they do, would be very helpful.

&#x200B;

How many planes does Virgin expect to build and operate?

What will this all cost? Who's paying? Stock offer? 

Do they have a plan? I listened to their CEO's interview and he just gave the usual corporate jargon.

For example, let’s use $STEM. Institutional ownership is at 11% and institutional transactions is at -52.31%. I understand that institutions own 11% of the shares. Does the institutional transactions number of -52.31% reflect institutions selling 52.31% of their shares (or total shares?) over a set period of time? I.e., “52.31% decrease in shares owned over the last week”, or “over the last 24 hours”, etc? I can’t help but feel like I misunderstand the metric for that one.

Related question: Any idea how often these values are updated? Of course some of the numbers are essentially real-time, but I’d imagine this value (inst. own./trans.) requires some reporting/tabulating.

For example, just 2 weeks ago, $STEM had 75.2% institutional ownership (with 10% inst. transactions), and it has dropped significantly (down to 11% ownership/-52.31% transactions). Depending on how often this metric is updated, I’m wondering if this might mean investors knew it was going to drop over the past few weeks, or indicate someone knows something negative is about to happen with the company.

Thanks in advance for any assistance.",Question about Finviz screener “institutional transactions” metric.,,

FAQ

**What does this mean?**

The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.

**Why did you do this?**

There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:

Rudeness towards other Redditors,

Spreading incorrect information,

Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.

**Am I banned from the Reddit?**

No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.

**I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?**

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

**How can I prevent this from happening in the future?**

Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.",,gzgimx5,t1_gxy1ika

So I'm a huge VG bear and I have high conviction that they will go bankrupt or liquidate or sell for peanuts, but here are some possibilities:

* If you look on their website, they clearly state that 250k was for early birds and if you sign up for waitlist, you most likely won't get that price. So 1.5 mil is a lower bound on revenue per flight.
* They have 2 spaceships (Unity -- tested and Imagine -- untested) and have 2 more under construction. Burt Rutan's Xprize winner was able to relaunch in 2 weeks, it is plausible that 2 space ships can do 50 launches a year after they get the kinks out and 4 space ships can do 100 launches. Maybe more. I personally would be concerned about market size if they can get to that cadence. 100 launches per year at 2 million revenue per flight is 200 million per year. Not enough to justify current valuation and still not profitable -- especially considering that many launches will add to costs. They'll have to launch a lot more often or somehow cut costs or charge a lot more.
* Their long term pivot business plan is point to point hypersonic transit. Good luck with that. They do have an advantage with their mothership-spaceship model in that they can launch from a population center without causing sonic boom issues in populated areas -- something Starship point-to-point has an issue with. Starship has to kludge it by saying there is going to be a transfer to an offshore platform. The problem with the mothership-spaceship model is it doesn't scale to larger ships and to get good margin, you need more passengers. Look at Stratolaunch and the size of that mothership -- largest plane in the world, it can't carry that big of a rocket -- no way of sending > 100 people at a time.",,gzgjhqg,t3_nl3ne2

Space tourism will certainly be a thing (there are already companies planning on having hotels in orbit), but most of the available 'rewards' \~right\~now\~ are the kind governments and state agencies usually reach for.  Pieces of the space travel vertical may be profitable, since the US government is leaning heavily on private companies for launch vehicles and lunar landers, but as far as products go, there really isn't much out there right now.

Eventually someone will put furnaces on the moon and convert lunar regolith into building blocks and they'll make something with them.  Other firms will setup refueling stations in orbit around Earth and the Moon, and if Elon is to be trusted, there'll be people on Mars in our lifetime.  It's all exploratory.  Only now instead of convincing a monarch that there's Gold across the ocean, we're doing it for the sake of scientific progress.

Shortish term plan is to build up their fleet, create an experience out of it, lower costs to appeal to a wider audience, and have high profit margins. Long term is what I’m interested in. Virgin Galactic has a deal with NASA in which they can look at all of the confidential government planes and their designs so that they may make a viables supersonic commercial aircraft themselves. A few different big banks have claimed that the market for hypersonic travel will be at 270 billion by 2030, and 800 billion by 2040. Although it sounds crazy, I think that this is actually a little conservative.

So I'll throw my opinion in as well.

To my knowledge, hyperinflation has not been seen in the United States since the Civil War, and then only on the Confederate side. See definition of hyper inflation: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hyperinflation.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hyperinflation.asp)

So I feel comfortable saying that we will not see hyperinflation in the U.S. at any time in our lives.

High inflation is of course quite possible and has occurred numerous times in U.S. history, but even in the oft referenced 70s, inflation peaked at around 13%, which, while uncomfortable, was hardly ruinous.

Right now the FED wants to see at least 2% inflation YOY. So a single quarter isn't going to be sufficient to trigger a FED response. Additionally the most recent report was heavily skewed towards a few items, like used cars. So I'm thinking we aren't really in trouble yet.

Many point to large increases in commodities prices. Quite understandable, but keep in mind that we basically shut down the economy last year. Commodity inventories drew down to extremely low levels. So now that we are reopening, commodities are suddenly in demand and it will take time to refill inventories. Simple supply/demand explanation for commodity price increases. High prices will be its own solution for commodities as commodity producers will switch into oversupply mode trying to take advantage of the price increases, which will in turn drive the prices right back down.

I do feel that wage increases pose an actual permanent inflation risk as the current worker shortage does seem to be raising wages across the board. Wages tend not to come back down once they go up. But even this is likely to be a one time bump that filters through the economy and modestly increases prices generally and then settles back down. It isn't likely that companies will keep raising wages unless they absolutely have to.

So expect some real but modest permanent inflation along with a lot of transitory inflation.",,gzgt5g0,t3_nkveh8
575,2021-05-26 02:18:32,t1_gzgt5jj,,investing,"My point is that the government is already invested in the economy without having to actually own stock. Stock entails rights to earnings and to management of the company. Through taxation and regulatory legislation, government can exert those rights without holding shares. Companies pay a percentage of their earnings to the government in the form of taxes in much the same way they may pay out some of their earnings to shareholders as dividends. If government wants to give companies access to more capital, then it doesn't have to buy stock or bonds, but can instead give tax breaks, subsidies, and loans. In no case does the Treasury actually have to interact with the stock market to get the benefits that are involved with investing in companies the way we would as citizens. The question of whether tax rates, tax breaks, and subsidies are properly allocated is in the realm of politics, but the basic idea is that the government is always investing in the US economy and always collecting its cut of the profits.",,gzgt5jj,t1_gzewexz

- It's likely that the Concorde actually was profitable, but it was very inflexible (only a few possible routes), aging (so would need replacement soon), and perhaps not as profitable as subsonic flights.
- There are several firms developing new supersonic aircraft. One innovation may significantly reduce the loudness of the sonic boom, which may allow those planes to operate over land and open up far more possible routes.
- The value-proposition of supersonic flight is more questionable nowadays. Planes have internet access which allow business travelers to do some work while in-transit (so it's not completely dead time). And travelers may prefer spending extra time in a subsonic business class with comfortable lay-down seats versus a shorter amount of time in less comfortable seats that we'd probably see in supersonic jets.
- Still there may be a small niche of commercial travelers who are very time-sensitive and would prefer a supersonic flight. There may also be a small market of ultra-wealthy individuals who may want to buy a supersonic private jet.

Overall my takeaway is that there may be a real if small market for supersonic travel, but Virgin Galactic is poorly positioned to take advantage of this. Its competitors have been focused exclusively on developing supersonic aircraft for the last two decades or so, and it's still going to be another decade or so until they expect to start delivering planes. Even if Virgin Galactic was positioned the same as its competitors, you're essentially speculating on a company that's a decade away from launch. It seems like there's a better ROI elsewhere.",,gzgu987,t1_gzgpqkk

These planes cost around $30-$50 billion estimated. 

Lots of people are saying the market doesn’t exist… well 52 million millionaires exist in the world so far.. let’s assume 1/1000 of them have enough money to afford a flight and are willing to experience it? That’s still 52,000 customers willing to fly… on top of that millionaires are now exponentially adding, while VG plans to reduce cost per flight.

Series 65 allows you to work as an investment advisor (usually at a Registered Investment Advisor).

My suggestion would be to first talk to your boss/company and see if there is a path for you to start branching into the investment side. They may not want someone on the loan side also trying to advise clients on the investment side to avoid potential conflicts of interest and things like that. Or, the may be fine with it.

If those two things were not true then I would love to experience it, but I don't believe my momentary experience of awe and wonder is worth even a minor impact on the environmental future of our planet, especially given the dire straits we're currently in.

If the flights can have some impact on perfecting and developing human space travel then that's great, but if those benefits are limited then again it becomes difficult to justify.

Considering the original X prize required Scaled Composites to fly SpaceShipOne twice within two weeks, that probably works out to a best-case scenario of 130 flights per year, or revenue of $195m

Let’s also be generous and add 50% for suborbital science contracts that they might be able to include along with those flights, bringing us to $292m

I have no idea what kind of costs Virgin has to worry about, but lets say they can blow airlines way and run an operating margin of 30%.

I have 3 remaining hurdles to leap through in order to make that conclusion: 

1. **To understand if Unity Engine can compete in the non-gaming segments**

   2. Question 2: Using Bentley as an example, how would Unity be able to penetrate into this market, as competitors have such specialized knowledge? 
2. **To understand if Unity ads business could thrive in that competitive space**
   1. Question 3: With Facebook and Google as market leader plus Apple's policy change, how well would Unity ads do?
3. **To compare if Unity's engine-operations-ads business model works better than Epic's engine-developer-publisher model**
   1. Question 4: would Unity's offering on game-ops solution be more helpful to game dev than Epic would? In other words, would Unity's solutions capture more game dev's challenge than Epic would? Note that I am referring to the entire business model, not just the engine itself

AMZN would be a great example, if you only looked at the bottom line in AMZN's financial statements you would see that they were unprofitable for many many years, but if you really looked at the totality of their financial statements you would've seen that they were actually profitable, they just instead re-invested everything dollar back into the company, therefore there was nothing to show for on the bottom line. Another way of looking at it is, when you get your pay cheque at the end of the month, after paying for all your expenses you use whatever is left over to buy stocks.

742,2021-05-26 04:02:24,t3_nl7vi9,nl7vi9,investing,"I personally think all these companies: Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, and Amazon are all really good companies. But, IF YOU HAD TO INVEST IN ONLY ONE OF THEM. Which one would you invest in and why? 

They’re all huge, still growing, and making a lot of money. I am invested in all of them. Wasn’t a fan of Facebook, still not, yet I can’t deny that from an investing perspective they are a strong company. While I thought Facebook was dying and just for moms and dads, they got Instagram which everyone my age loves and used. They monetized their offerings tremendously well. Every time I thought they’re on a down hill from social pressures, they shoot back up. 

Microsoft was my favorite holding. I love Nadella, I love his vision. He played a tremendous role into turning Microsoft around and into the company that it is today. Their cloud services are growing and I believe are second behind AWS. They have their productivity and business sector which is compromised of office. Office changed was pushed towards a subscription model, one with better profit-margins.  As and end user I’m not a fan of this, but to get through college I needed those subscriptions. Their personal computing segment has been growing with their surface line. While I personally have a surface pro, I don’t love it. Yet since I got it they have been updating their line and have been putting pressure on the competition. I’m also excited for their gaming division. Not only their Xbox but how they are offering a new gaming experience. While I believe it almost may be redundant to get an Xbox if you have a gaming pc, how they’re connecting players on Xbox and pc may be the better option long term (potentially). 

Apple has been making amazing iPhones. While they have not been revolutionary model to model, people love their ecosystem. That’s the biggest thing for me. People love iPhones. They love MacBooks. Show me a college white girl without a MacBook, good luck. They go better together than a college white girl and starbucks. Also they are expanding offerings in their ecosystem. Their offerings are very easy to use, simple yet not plain, and a premium product. This is a company that has been consistently delivering amazing products. 

Alphabet, I’m not really sure what they do. Googles search engine I’m not sure anyone will ever overtake them. They are consistently adapting and improving it. They a make ton of ad revenue not only from google but YouTube. The more we use their products, the more data they collect, the better they know us and can profit of us. They I love YouTube ads? No. Are they making a ton of money of us? Yes. Also, they have a big R&D budget. That puts me at peace about their future, that they are eager to grow and not satisfied with that they have achieve. 

Amazon I believe of all companies has been spending the most on R&D. Their AWS Is leading and growing. From my understanding Azure still has a lot of catching up to do in terms of product quality and offerings. In fact, I would love Amazon even without their online market place. I really love Amazon For their AWS. I believe it brings in most of their profit. 

I don’t believe any of these companies are perfect, some of their products I don’t like, some of their fundamentals I’m not a fan of; yet, overall I think each of these companies has a lot of strengths. I own all of them, yet, if you had to choose one of them to invest in, you can choose the time horizon, which one would you invest in?

How ""guaranteed"" is this income? Look at it from the banks perspective....this is risky.

You arn't putting up any asset to collateralize the loan they give you. Your income now depends on a business doing well (future revenue) which you are no longer part of and have no control over.

The correct way for you to get cash wash to have the seller get a loan from a bank for the purchase of your company and to have them pay you cash.

You can look into factoring or something of the like..but you don't even have ""accounts receivable"" to lend against..you sold those.

Can you take out more on your mortgage? Home equity line of credit? (Since you'll now have more cash inflow ..hopefully...to pay something like that off?). Can you secure a bank loan with stocks or brokerage funds?

This, in my opinion, is not a good situation. Even if a bank believes your future company will make profits (and you will in turn receive profits)...they would want you to have eggs in that basket (ownership) before they put their eggs in that basket with a loan against that.

Maybe someone will buy that promissory note from you for 80% of the value...and then they receive the payments...but they're really going to have to believe in that businesses success and ability to pay. I'd say 50% is more likely for a cash offer...",,gzh4jmi,t3_nl640m

Of all the FAAMG’s I’m most bullish on Amazon followed by Microsoft over the long run (long on Seattle area haha). Over the long run you need to go with culture - as been said before on this forum, the rest of these businesses have golden eggs (Instagram, Windows, iPhone, Search, YouTube, etc.) - I think Amazon is the only one with a Golden Goose. Brutal but effective internal culture leads to accurate and rapid decision-making (recommend Brad Stone’s books if want to learn more). They have a deep bench so I think they’ll continue to do well in the Jassy era and will have Jeff watching over from the board.

It sounded great and felt like the next natural step to subsonic flight. It was certainly used, but ultimately failed becuase it was not market viable after so many years. 

Actual space travel might be different becuase of the lack of friction in space. Air resistance is the biggest blocker in air travel, so eliminating that barrier sounds awesome. But who knows, the energy it takes to exit the atmosphere might be *astronomical* to a point where it would bury the whole business, and thus space travel industry, back in the dirt. 

Maybe I'm too small money, but it sounds quite risky to me given the engineering challenges that still need to be overcome *and*  industrialized before it starts to look like a reasonable investment to a retail investor like me.",,gzh78rh,t3_nl3ne2

There was genuine value in attempting this form of space tourism 10 years ago - Richard Branson initially predicted a spaceflight would come in 2009. But now the entire flight profile is so ludicrously expensive and impractical compared to what SpaceX, Blue Origin, and other companies attempting manned reusable rockets that I'm not sure what market they're trying to capture any more. SpaceX will carry civilians to the **Moon** within a few years. It won't be long before they have commercial suborbital flights, and the price will be a tiny, tiny fraction of the $250,000 that Virgin Galactic is asking for.

 Their entire business model has been put into question with the development of reusable rockets.

I’m 23 years old, CPA, currently investing about 2k per month into individual stocks. Total portfolio is about 40k, made up of 28 stocks. Mostly high multiple tech (cathie wood stocks), but I keep some FANG and high yield REITs. I also have a Roth that I contribute 500 per month into something more conservative (I think Vanguard?)

I won’t need the money for 20-30 years, and I’m comfortable holding through volatility. My focus is really just finding quality companies that will be long-term winners. My question is:

1. How many stocks is enough to be adequately diversified as the portfolio grows? I feel i could cut down to under 20 stocks and concentrate in my top holdings. 

2. I’ve been aggressively buying stocks on the way down and trimming positions on the way up. Does it make sense long-term to take profits often?

There are roughly 150k to 175k commercial passenger jet flights per day worldwide.

Virgin optimistically plans for 8000 flights over the next decade. Total emissions are roughly 70% of a roundtrip flight from NY to London. Or based on a per passenger carbon footprint metric, 60% of that same roundtrip flight.

So you’re looking at adding 1/114,700th more emissions over a decade if airline traffic doesn’t increase at all during that period, which it obviously will.

I wouldn’t exactly call that massive.

Investopedia is a great beginner's resource to look up different terms and the basics of the licenses. FINRA's website will also be a good place to go for a more in depth look at what the licenses test on.

One important thing to note is that you cannot take the 7 or 66 on your own, you have to be sponsored by a FINRA registered member firm. This would likely mean you would have to talk to your CU and the investment firm you work with to sponsor you (most places will pay for your study material and exam fees if you pass).

I know quite a few loan officers who have transitioned into advisors and stayed within their bank to help clients, so it's definitely doable but be prepared to sell.

I understand the concept of decay but looking at the historical charts of UPRO vs VOO and TQQQ vs QQQ, leveraged ETFs have historically outperformed their non-leveraged counterparts by a large margin over the long term.

The only disadvantage I see with leveraged ETFs is extreme volatility and the fact that investments may take much longer to recover after a prolonged bear market.

Safe and affordable in this industry takes years to decades. Space flight as it stands now has lower safety factors than commercial aviation. Furthermore the cost of bringing a single kilogram to low earth orbit the last I checked was over $10k. 

Commercializing space travel and letting private citizens fly means regulations will increase in that sector (if there even are any to begin with since this is all basically uncharted territory). Regulations (while a good thing in aerospace) mean costs go up and profits go down.

It also burns solid fuel which breaks down into far more harmful elements than what the Virgin plane uses, a plane that launches from 60,000 feet, burns for only 60 seconds and weighs what I can only imagine is a tiny fraction of the shuttle’s weight.

On the flip side plans flying out of LAX alone create 800,000 tons of co2 emissions per month.

So again, quite a few orders of magnitude different. A fraction of a fraction of a fraction added to global emissions. Not a, “massive impact.”

Your average car emits as much co2 into the atmosphere in about 4 years of driving as a space shuttle launch. Think about that and think of the size of a space shuttle vs Virgin’s space plane.",,gzhhhxv,t1_gzhceox

901,2021-05-26 07:07:06,t1_gzhk5eu,,investing,"The most a triple leveraged (index) fund can drop in one day is 60%, since trading will be halted for the day after a 20% drop in the index. With daily rebalancing, the following day you can again only lose, at most, 60% of the remaining value before trading halts. The means on day 1 your portfolio will be worth 40% of the day before; day 2, 16%; day 3, 6.4%; and so on.

If you’re buying a leveraged index ETF, you don’t need to worry about it going to 0. There will be daily rebalancing, and reverse splits, that prevent that from occurring.

That being said, there is very high risk with these ETFs. I like to imagine it as being (3x) long the index, while also being short (non-leveraged) volatility. If volatility spikes while prices increase, the ETF value will increase, since the 3x long “outweighs” the 1x “short volatility”. If volatility spikes while price remains constant or decreases, you lose money from both your 3x long and 1x “short volatility” position. This of course isn’t perfectly accurate and mainly just an approximation, but it helps get the point across, to me at least.

So, think of it this way: would you hold a position that is 3x long QQQ or SPY, and 1x short VIX? If not, don’t hold TQQQ or UPRO without a hedge. There’s been lots of discussion on various forums about viable strategies to hold 3x leveraged funds, and being long bonds as 40-60% of your portfolio with the remainder dedicated to 3x leveraged funds seems to be the most stable over time. There’s still risk involved of course.

If you’re planning on going all-in on 3x leveraged ETFs, be prepared to lose 60% of your portfolio every day during a black swan event. If that is an acceptable risk and you’re bullish on the index, then take it. If not, consider a small position and/or hedging the position with appropriate products (long volatility with rebalancing? bonds? metals? many possibilities here).

The key with these leveraged ETFs, from my experience, is timing the market. Everyone who has failed will tell you it’s impossible, and everyone who has succeeded will tell you that you just need to pay attention to the right things. Personally, I think it’s all bullshit and they got lucky, but to each their own. If you’re going to hold leveraged ETFs, be prepared to sell on the slightest hint of a bad time, and at the very least set up stop loss orders to minimize your suffering in the event of a crash. 

Disclaimer: currently long TQQQ and UPRO as a not-insignificant portion of my portfolio. My hedging methods are currently mostly untested (since both my TQQQ and UPRO positions are green), so I’ve given some generic hedging advice above. Take it with a grain of salt.

Another note, assuming you hold both UPRO and TQQQ, exclusively: a 20% drop in SPY causes a trading halt until the following day, *market-wide*, whereas a 20% drop in QQQ caused a trading halt until the following day *for QQQ*, to the best of my knowledge. If, for some reason, SPY hits -20% in one day before QQQ does, trading on QQQ (and TQQQ) will halt till the following day, meaning your portfolio will drop by *less* than 60%. Likewise, if QQQ drops -20% in a day, trading will be halted, while SPY may not drop that much, again resulting in a less than 60% loss of your portfolio.",,gzhk5eu,t3_nl9l9d

909,2021-05-26 07:16:56,t1_gzhkuv6,,investing,"Just saw this. The strike price is set at the time the option is created. So anyone who trades options can set the strike price. If you write an option you could set it at whatever you want (assuming you can cover the margin). Btw also another difference with insurance. With an options account, you can be the buyer or seller of the ""insurance"". Meaning you can collect these little premiums but you run the risk of a a major loss. The key part of options pricing is not so much determining the strike price (as it is an input) but determining the actual price with regards to the strike price. The distance is what matters. If the two are close (and not in the money), it is much more likely to hit the strike and result in a payoff. To stick with the insurance example. The insurance company can keep adding more and more unlikely things but the fees will be smaller (with huge losses in the event of a claim). For example, when you buy coverage for crashing into buildings - the notional value is in the millions and far exceeds the price of the car. There must be a video explaining this better, but if you find a an options calculator you can play around with it and it should make sense. And you can look up the options prices of any well-known stock to see how price changes with regards to strike price.",,gzhkuv6,t1_gyoh4cg

Why they don't use that cash to fund debt, purchase assets, or whatever else beats me, maybe banks are scared of inflation themselves and don't want more money to flow around and are  sending all excess back to the fed. Maybe this is the fed's way of secretly tapering without actually tapering purchases and sending the market into a freefall.

In trying to understand what role Apex Clearing vs Citadel plays in a typical online trade, I have found myself more and more confused by these terms.   


When platforms like RH direct orders to Citadel, is Citadel the clearinghouse? I understand the PFOF business model, but why would Citadel also direct orders to Apex at times? How many times do orders get directed or redirected before someone actually clears the trade?  


Is Apex Clearing is a clearinghouse, that everyone ultimately directs orders to? Would really appreciate some 'clear' explaination. Cheers.",clearinghouse vs clearing firm vs clearing (carrying) broker?????,,
