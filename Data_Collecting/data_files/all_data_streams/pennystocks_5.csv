Then they will receive shares of the New company that the settlement estimates at $5.47. So thet gives you $7 of value. They are also offering a special share purchase that they estimate at another $1 value. So you will get paid out, then issued a stock will list at about 5.50 on opening day. But, with the hot rental market and new debt structure, I believe the new reissued stock will soar. I do not believe that you will be able to buy the new company stock below $7 on opening day.

A 10 bagger is a stock that increases in value by at least 10 times its purchase price, or by at least 900%. It will take a few years for it to get to that level which is why this is my long term investment! A few things I will point out is 1. California 2. Their Business Model 3. Plenty of room for growth 4. The land acquisition because businesses can be built off of various Competitive Advantages and Brand messages, but without a winning Distribution strategy, there is no business! 

The following comes from a press release We are setting the stage to improve margins while expanding end-market access, and to grow, refine, produce, distribute, sell, and home-deliver top cannabis products in the largest and fastest growing cannabis market on the planet.

30,gz10vrx,2021-05-22 05:32:45,t1_gz10vrx,t1_gz0r5tb,pennystocks,"I was in a similar situation. I sold some at a loss and then added a little more money to my account. Note, this is my play account so we're not taking serious money. I was then able to average down a few other stocks and get out with some gains in some cases.  From there I have made better choices and picked better entry points. I'm still down about 18% overall but my portfolio is in much better shape and I have some winners I am holding. I think I'll be whole again by summer. 

I sold positions that freed up the most cash which gave me the ability to average down on smaller positions and get out whole on some of those or very close on others. 

My biggest change in my investing strategy was watching my entry points. DD is hit and miss and there are so many PnD stocks. I started focusing on getting stocks that have previously traded higher but for one reason or another are near 52 week lows or at low positions that historically have represented stops.  So far so good for me but again, my penny stock account is the same as sitting at the blackjack table. Strictly for fun. This is not financial advise. Good luck",,

No real catalysts expected other than: they beat earnings, and haven't really had a good COVID recovery bump yet.

106,,2021-05-22 12:03:15,t3_nih52r,,pennystocks,"Hi folks,

I've been searching quite a lot about this ticker. People talk about it as if it was the next potential $TSNP. 

I do believe that I know which company will merge with GVSI : Road Runner Media Inc. **Why ?** 

Pretty basic, actually. 

&#x200B;

*Processing img vf4tduwkun071...*

Look at the name of the two company officers (Richard Cutler and Randal Lanham). Randal also figure on the court paper for the custodianship. 

&#x200B;

*Processing img 4nubk2gxun071...*

**So what is road runner ?** 

« Road Runner Media, Inc. (RRM): A Technology company helping to resolve approximately 500,000 commercial vehicle accidents, resulting in over 5,000 mortalities in the USA annually. This is achieved through patented technology that enhances road and vehicle safety while accessing the existing $29 Billion Dollar Out Of Home (OOH) media market. RRM’s technology operates at the intersection of commercial vehicle fleets and Out Of Home Media, and consists of three (3) components: 1. A patented Vehicle Operational Indicator (VOI) is a rear-facing media display that operates in real-time as a “Digital Brake Light” (DBL), indicating when the vehicle operator brakes stops, selects turn signals, reverse and emergency flashers, enabling surrounding drivers to react accordingly. 2. The ability to display or integrate into Public Service Announcements (PSA) such as AMBER Alerts, and other federal and local government safety & emergency broadcast systems. 3. A proprietary Content Management System (CMS) enables real-time, local, and nationally targeted, messaging, and advertising to be transmitted to the display when the VOI and PSA are not being shown.» (Linkedin)

**They recently had partnership with Siemens technicians as it is stated in the picture above :** « We are excited to announce that [Road Runner Media, Inc.](https://www.linkedin.com/company/road-runner-media-inc/) will install our patented, rear-facing Digital Brake Light screens on 2,500 [Siemens](https://www.linkedin.com/company/siemens/) technicians vans across the U.S. The 46"" connected screens will enhance road safety and host brand advertising, giving marketers and agencies a new channel to reach consumer audiences on-the-move. » 

**They also had a debt financing recently of 60 millions :** 

« To pursue this idea, Lanham (who described himself as a “recovering attorney”) enlisted Chris Riley as CEO — Riley’s [experience](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisrriley/) includes several years as CEO of PepsiCo Australia and New Zealand. And the company announced this week that it has secured $62.5 million in debt financing from Baseline Growth Capital.

The idea of putting ads on moving vehicles isn’t new. There are, of course, ads on the tops of taxis, and [startups like Firefly](https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/firefly-strong-outdoor/) are also putting digital signage on top of Ubers and Lyfts. But Riley said Road Runner’s ruggedized, high-resolution LCD screens are very different, due to their size, quality and placement. »

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For now, these are the infos that I found. I'm not quite sure what to think about it. I know that a lot of people are skeptical about this new way of adding adds to our driving systems. I am also sceptic about the financial aspect. I was in $GVSI but I sold all my position when I saw this. 

Currently, **GVSI is trading at 03 cents**, with a **market cap of 76 millions.** 

I'm really curious about what you guys think. Let me know !

Cheers.",nih52r,"$GVSI, a custodianship play //"

One's shares represent  the discounted price of future revenue.  So how would that be affected by folk's going to jail?  Now short term SP may/ will be affected but for the long term investor the ONLY thing that is going to affect it up or down is the oil itself.

When BP had their oil spill in Gulf or Toyota airbags killed a whole bunch of folks in the end it didn't matter because each share's value ONLY matter if they stop selling oil or cars respective.  

This the EXACT reason I love these catalyst plays.  As an investor it is easy to know when to stay in or out of the play.  It ALL matters on them doing when their job is, i.e. to find/ pull oil out of the ground.  That's it.  That is why I posted this for folks who wanted to timelines of each upcoming catalyst on that quest.  If they fail at that  yes the SP will drop (as it should).",,

For now, I don't really know what to think about the financing debt of 60 millions of Road Runner. They seems to be confident in their business model to get such a financing and they have partnership, but this is OTC and they already have a large cap (70 millions). My guess is that the stock will rise back to .05 cents at some point because of GS hype, and that it will tank when they'll release the name of the merge. To me, the company operate in a non-sexy field, so I think the hype will vanish real quick. 

To me, the only way that it could be hyped up, it is if they announced the merge + a publicity partnership with big corporation (they can do road publicity with that kind of technology so that could be an opportunity).

If it says Pink/No Information, and has a little picture of a stop sign, you're most likely going to need to sell those stocks before September, otherwise you won't be able to sell them at all.

Some of the No Info stocks are working on getting current, so you don't need to panic with them. I was able to find some of that by searching the ticker on Twitter. The ones that are not doing anything to get current need to go. As far as we've seen, no broker is going to allow you to buy OR sell these stocks, so you'll be stuck with them.

Once you've figured out which stocks need to go, you can work on the other suggestions you've gotten here. Averaging down to minimize loss has been my main move. Look at the total price you spent for each stock, and decide how much of a loss you can deal with. You may have spent so little on some that it's not worth the effort to try to average down.

1. For those aiming to purely make a quick and speculative play, skip to the ""Upcoming Catalysts and Timeline"" and ""TLDR"" section below.
2. \*Caveat. This is not financial advice nor am I liable for any of your investment decisions. I can literally bicep curl better than I write DD posts yet alone invest so please do so in your own terms.

# A. Preamble

$ONCT is one of the most underslept stocks in the biotech yet alone larger investing community, no question. Considering its solid clinical results and upcoming catalysts (literally in a few weeks), I don't see why it isn't getting the recognition it deserves.

ONCT is an early stage biotech specializing in targeting ROR1 expressing cancers. While cancer has always been a hot topic in this industry, ONCT is one of the *few* companies addressing it through the lens of ROR1. I'll explain more about ROR1 below but this isn't your run of the mill gene, protein, or whatever that other pharma companies are focusing on. VelosBio, another company focused on ROR1 cancers was acquired by Merck in 2020 for $2.8B ([https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/merck-inks-2-8b-velosbio-buyout-to-snag-anti-ror1-adc](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/merck-inks-2-8b-velosbio-buyout-to-snag-anti-ror1-adc)). The same for NBE-Therapeutics for $1.5B in 2020 by Boehringer Ingelheim ([https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/boehringer-inks-1-5b-nbe-buyout-joining-merck-ror1-adc-race](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/boehringer-inks-1-5b-nbe-buyout-joining-merck-ror1-adc-race)) . Looks like huge players in pharma are interested in ROR1 for some reason, and lucky for us, ONCT does *exactly* that.

# B. Cirmtuzumab for MCL and CLL (Blood Cancer)

https://preview.redd.it/jrh5iqzd67071.png?width=444&format=png&auto=webp&s=cad45ccd1668a57f107eaf0aeaf6c00bc786acda

A lot of things destroy cancer but those same things can also destroy our own healthy cells. **Cirmutzumab** is a potential first in class monoclonal antibody developed by ONCT and targets the ROR1 protein on the surface of cancer cells. ROR1 activity is associated with very **aggressive** symptoms ranging from metastasis to treatment resistance. Lucky for us, ROR1 is *highly* specific to a wide range of different cancers as seen in the figure below and is the very thing cirmtuzumab targets.

**Figure 1**. ROR1 Expression Across Different Tumors

https://preview.redd.it/v441lbhf67071.png?width=632&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa6e88427942443aea09ac3e48d5faf1e073de34

As seen in Figure 1, indications of interest are Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), both of which express ROR1 at extremely high levels. These are B-cell malignancies or hematologic cancers. Alright enough with the fluffy intros, **what does the data say?**

**Figure 2.** CIRLL Phase ½ Trial Data for MCL and CLL

https://preview.redd.it/ow3vwqhg67071.png?width=1514&format=png&auto=webp&s=665da36941ac844fa3247b756381ade612d94fb1

In a treatment design combining cirmtuzumab with ibrutinib, another treatment for hematologic malignancies, the **objective response rate** for MCL was **87%** and **92%** for CLL (Figure 2). So why was cirmtu incorporated with ibrutinib to begin with? Unfortunately, a large number of older patients develop resistance to ibrutinib and hematological disease like MCL can be extremely aggressive with a low 5-year survival rate ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7281539/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7281539/)). The combination not only exceeded the efficacy of standalone ibrutinib therapy for MCL with a historical ORR of around 65% but also did so in high-risk populations that were **heavily pre-treated with other therapies**. The data is non-negotiable (Figure 3).

**Figure 3**. Overview of Results in Sub-Populations. CR stands for complete response while PR stands for partial response.

https://preview.redd.it/6duwxg9h67071.png?width=802&format=png&auto=webp&s=f28331fe2273759d751b460cb710b582f0855c0b

Like I said before, a lot of things can attack cancer albeit at the expense of our own cells. Safety is all the more important for cancer and older patients with potentially compromised immune function. There were **0 discontinuations or dose limiting toxicities from cirmtuzumab**. So we potentially have a promising new therapy that targets a range of cancers effectively while minimizing treatment side-effects. Sounds like a solid win to me.

As a side note, ONCT recently expanded their indications to other cancers such as breast cancer. In a trial conducted in UC San Diego, patients with HER2 negative metastatic or locally advanced unresectable breast cancer were treated with cirmtuzumab + paclitaxel. This is an **extremely aggressive form of breast cancer** with patients receiving a **median of 6 prior therapies**. The study reported an objective response rate of around 57% which beats the historical rate at around 30% for this subgroup of patients. I will admit, the share price took a hit after this announcement. I venture to say this was a combination of people selling the news and people feeling discouraged with the seemingly low response rate of 57% without realizing that these patients were being treated for **aggressive and treatment resistance breast cancer**.

ONCT is also in dialogue with the **FDA for a potential accelerated approval study for MCL.** Now, clinical trials can last years so will we have patent protection once this therapy is approved? Yup, **patent protection extending all the way to 2033**.

# C. TK216 for Ewing Sarcoma

https://preview.redd.it/pxd7rhai67071.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=2fa1075705c3a7ab94fac97e2dfc3ca4cfae0105

To pivot, ONCT is also developing a treatment called **TK216** for Ewing Sarcoma. Ewing sarcoma is a very rare pediatric cancer and the 2nd most common pediatric bone cancer. The current standard of care is absolutely abysmal and is based on chemotherapy and invasive surgical procedures. I seriously can't stress how pitiful current treatments are for this disease.

TK216 targets a family of proteins called ETS factors that are directly implicated in Ewing sarcoma and other cancers. So what does the data say about TK216? Well, in a phase ½ trial conducted on patients with relapsed Ewing sarcoma and who received on average **4 prior therapies**, TK216 accomplished a **9% complete response rate** and **43% disease control rate**. Looks crappy right? Until you dig around and look at the response rates of approved therapies for this disease, you won't realize how **phenomenal** these results are. The FDA seems to agree and has assigned TK216 with an **orphan drug designation for Ewing Sarcoma**.

**Figure 4**. TK216 Clinical Response Rate in Relapsed or Refractory Ewing Sarcoma

https://preview.redd.it/ibaa2klj67071.png?width=950&format=png&auto=webp&s=52b0601afed2f424f774e83ce15c5bb52e834186

# D. *** Upcoming Catalysts

Here's a brief overview on the expected milestones and timeline

https://preview.redd.it/946b3zik67071.png?width=1906&format=png&auto=webp&s=f353cf54506b071c6bb20e24598f58d298312d44

**Most importantly** **and the reason why I'm writing this post right now**, ONCT will be presenting its most updated results for cirmtuzumab on MCL and CLL patients and TK216 on Ewing sarcoma in the **2021 ASCO Conference on June 4th and 7th**. This is **highly anticipated data** in what is the world's leading cancer conference, and I expect a huge run up to the conference. Just for reference, ONCT experienced a 78.1% surge in price after releasing an update on its phase ½ trial for cirmtuzumab back in November of 2020. Moreover, the embargoed abstracts for these results were released **today**.

# E. May 19th Data Updates

On May 19th, ONCT released its embargoed abstracts containing the most recent updates concerning cirmtuzumab and TK216. I'd encourage you to look into the updated data yourself:

1. Cirmtuzumab ([https://investor.oncternal.com/news-releases/news-release-details/oncternal-therapeutics-presents-updated-interim-data-cirmtuzumab](https://investor.oncternal.com/news-releases/news-release-details/oncternal-therapeutics-presents-updated-interim-data-cirmtuzumab)).
2. TK216 ([https://investor.oncternal.com/news-releases/news-release-details/oncternal-therapeutics-presents-updated-interim-data-tk216](https://investor.oncternal.com/news-releases/news-release-details/oncternal-therapeutics-presents-updated-interim-data-tk216)).

While the details of each trial will be discussed at the conference, I want to mention some key results.

**Cirmtuzumab for MCL May 19th Update**:

1. Objective response rate of **83%** in **heavily pre-treated patients with MCL, beating the historical ORR of 66%.**
2. Complete response rate of **39% for MCL, beating the historical CR rate of 20%.**
3. Median progression-free survival and overall survival **not reached.**
4. **Excellent safety profile** with slight improvements compared to historical treatment with ibrutinib.

**Cirmtuzumab for CLL May 19th Update:**

1. Objective response rate of **94%** in **heavily pre-treated patients with CLL.**
2. Median progression-free survival and overall survival **not reached.**
3. **Excellent safety profile** with slight improvements compared to historical treatment with ibrutinib.

**TK216 for Ewing Sarcoma May 19th Update:**

1. **2 patients with complete response** with a follow up of over 1 year each.
2. Stable disease reached for **35.5%** of patients.
3. Updated safety profile showing that TK216 was well-tolerated with no unexpected off-target toxicities or deaths.
4. Patients had **metastases at study entry and heavily pre-treated with a median # of 3 prior systemic therapies**

I wanted to spend more time writing a thorough DD highlighting additional factors such as the management team, details on market potential, expansion into CAR-T therapy, etc. but I wanted to at least post something up before the expected run up to the ASCO conference. If you are interested, I will be happy to write a part II and follow up to this post.

TLDR

1. Promising data on hematological cancers and Ewing sarcoma to be released in **June 4th and 7th,** making this a possible short-term play. Historically, large surges in price with each data release.
2. Embargoed abstracts for #1 released today with excellent data.",ngpzbi,$ONCT: Highly Undervalued With Upcoming Catalysts

I’ve come to the conclusion that it’s worth it to have both higher risk/reward plays and some lower on the risk/reward scale. To put it another way, you can win a baseball game by either relying on home runs or stringing together a bunch of singles and doubles. 

So this one has a potential to be a 5-10X bagger but you know there’s less risk of losing 20-30% on any given day. Growth potential is limited, but it’ll likely take less time to achieve that growth than that sure 50-100X bagger.

The company issued an offering recently which led its stock to drop from 10$ a share down to about 3$ where it bottomed out.

Since then the daily chart has been curling up, it has been very bearish up until this point. All of the indicators are very extended, bottomed out and converging on bullish. As of three days ago green volume has started coming in more and more. Currently as of Friday sitting at 2x average volume.
AEI has a low float of 6m, and currently receiving higher than average volume as it curls back up. Its sitting at 4.21$ after hours, but on the 30min chart it is very extended and I would expect a pullback to the 4$ mark and hold that as new support. If it hold 4$ there isn't anything stopping it to 6$. Especially if it receives more volume, with a 6m float, this stock could go crazy and I want to be in it if and when it does!

It’s (generally) a good idea to not place your buy or sell order amounts all at once. I like to buy and sell in 1/3 increments, a lesson I learned the hard way. A common exception would be if, say, I catch a ticker right as news dropped and it’s taking off. For those day trades, you want to have an entry and exit plan, and just stick with it, quick in and out. Too easy to get stuck with bags, and you’ll rarely time the top or bottom perfectly, no sense in risking your gains. 

It’s easy to get greedy, and I’m sure you’ve heard to not trade on emotions—emotional trading is by far the biggest culprit. Having a plan, a typical trading style you adhere to, and setting your risk tolerance and profit targets help to remain consistent, and is the best way to eliminate that as much as possible. Things will differ depending on the stock/company (also note that often times, the stock ≠ the company) and what kind of play it is, but these are generally things to keep in mind. Periodically reassess your plays and see if your plan is still on track, or adjust if fundamentals have changed. And one more time for good measure: consistency is key!",,

I read the first sentence and realized you have no idea what you're talking about. Sharp has applied for custodianship of dozens of companies and the only case he actually won was by default because the company did not represent itself. He's literally 0 for 30.

If you wanna track his progress, there was a court meeting on Friday about his custodianship of RETC. There was no resolution and will continue session on Monday at 330pm EST. I have no doubt that RETC is shady af considering the woman they chose to represent them doesn't even know who the chairmen are, but I can assure you if Sharp does win this, it has NOTHING to do with him having a ""good track record"".

As far as GVSI. I'm not a buyer until I see some progress, they haven't filed a report in 5 years.

As far as things to watch monday, I've got a shortlist:

$MDCN - Nothing for 6 years. Filed everything they need to go current this weekend.

$GLDFF - New acquisition yesterday, name change (and ticker change) on Tuesday.

$PALAF - Filed 27 reports this weekend, one of them stating there was no uranium leak.

$EEGI / $RLBD / $EEGI / $MJWL - ""Hot"" stocks at the moment.

I'd bet my entire account that at least 2 of these are gonna be moving this week.",,

**Subsidiaries**

\- Etelix: VoIP in Latam, Africa and Asia. Super important. Underdeveloped countries have high demand for VoIP (telephones communicating over TCP/IP instead of copper cables, high quality sound). 4G and 5G connectivity. THIS IS WHERE THE BIG MONEY WILL BE. Etelix will be a huge driver for the company. And if Etelix succeed with infrastructure, all their other subsidiaries within telecom witll benefit from newly developed and acquired technologies.

\- SwissLink: VoIP in Europe. Mehh. Not interesting but a stable and slowly growing source of revenue.

\- QGlobal SMS: SMS-messaging focused in USA (not interesting but stable source of income) and south America (very interesting, poor existing telecom solutions).

\- SMSDirectos: Colombian Marketing Service, potential for high YoY growth. Especially when Colombias economy starts growing post COVID

\- IoTLabs: Tricky to predict. If they succeed with somewhat disruptive products and services, they will se a HUGE YoY growth and could be a company driver as well.

\- Global Money One: Financial technology focused, aiming to disrupt the Fin market with better and faster payment solutions and secure international money transfers. Also, a successful vertical integration with their blockchain technology could make their revenue rocket like mad dogs.

&#x200B;

This company has EVERYTHING they need to succeed. EPS, YoY growth and net profit will rip a hole in the fabric of space in 2023.

If you buy now, I believe you will tripple your money EoY. Then continue to earn in 2022, and cry of joy in 2023.

This is a LONG TERM investment. Buy as much stock as you can afford now, and then forget the company. Dont check your portfolio or read news about them. Just forget them and check your account again on new years eve for a lovely surprise.

One thing is almost certain though. If you buy now, you wil buy the deepest dip we will ever see. If I'm wrong about this, I will get in a fighting ring with a real bear! This company is CRIMINALLY undervalued. I work in this sector and I have done DD on IQST for 3 months. I have never seen such a stupid stock price of a company in my life.",,

- Current ratio: everything I find points to a good ratio being above 2. That doesn’t seem right based on penny stocks having high burn rates. What should I realistically aim for here for penny stocks (3/4/5+)?

- Debt to equity: again, conventional wisdom of D/E<1 doesn’t seem realistic here when looking at penny stocks. What makes sense here (1.5:1 / 1.2:1 / 1:1)?

- Price to cash flow: what should I be looking for here with penny stocks?",nj7ky1,Question on fundamentals for penny stocks

The title is important “@TellurianLNG
 ready to support this cooperation 🇺🇸 + 🇰🇷with #USLNG from Driftwood #LNG $TELL”

Not so significant in itself but consider these other two events along with this, and I suspect TELL and South Korea will be announcing an equity partnership soon.


This was an article last month: https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/042721-s-koreas-lng-demand-forecast-to-rise-15-through-2034-ministry

There are some VERY significant quotes in there... 

[President Moon Jae-in, who took office in May 2017, has vowed to increase power generation by LNG to reduce the country's heavy reliance on coal and nuclear, in an effort to address mounting public concerns over air pollution and nuclear safety.]

[“The country will prepare for a stable LNG supply as demand for the fuel can possibly be up to 52.53 million mt in 2034, in case of bigger demand for power production,"" the ministry official said.]

[“As part of efforts to ensure a stable supply, South Korea will diversify LNG imports sources,"" the MOTIE statement said.]

[""We will also increase investments in LNG projects overseas through which we can bring in volumes in equity stakes,"" it said.]


In addition to that article, about two weeks ago, Tellurian CEO  Octavio Simoes was appointed as chairman of the US Korea Business Council (USKBC)
