I think it's very comparable from a human behavior perspective. If I can't afford to or am not willing to buy, I rent until the market corrects. When the market corrects, I buy a foreclosure or short sale on the cheap and the people foreclosed on move into rental property until they get their credit/finances back to where they want it to be and clear the foreclosure.",,

505,gzichxq,2021-05-26 13:07:43,t1_gzichxq,t1_gzi6wcy,wallstreetbets,"Like OP said. I just wanted to add that this world of characters is a staple of good modern Norwegian culture and puppet movies.


Kjell Aukrust, a dude, wrote and drew some amazing charachters back in the 70s or so: A down to earth bike repairman (the guy with the sixpence), an overly anxious and pessimistic hedgehog (he has gone to the outside toilet that is encased in smoke (actually the toilet gets stuck to the rocket and he becomes a blind passenger on the moon trip)) and an overly optimistic bird ""of low morals, but good at the core"".

The three live on top of a pinnacle mountain ""37 miles (metric, so bout 200 English miles ) north, a bit east, and up the valley"". 

The oldest movie is a puppeteering classic; Flåklypa Grand Prix. The bird gets the trio signed up to the world racing championship right in Flåklypa. 

Funded by an arab Oil sheik that got lost in the valleys, ""Sheik Ben Reddick Fy Fasan"" (Ben Raddish Holy Moley) and his assistant/goon Emanuel Desperados ""a true crossbreed of Gorilla and Chimpanzee"", who is the ape at the very end, they embark on the race and of course, through an exciting extended racing sequence, wins. The racing scene, both in scope and execution, for a stop motion film was and is legendary and very technically impressive, and basically consist of building the entire track, mounting a camera on wheels and racing the cars like a big RC shoot. Mixed in with closeups of puppeteering the drivers. The race itself is surprisingly engaging and one of the newer Herbie movies basically jacked the entire race and replicated it in rough terms. I am not sure if they had to buy rights or how they did it. :p

The movie came in the 70s right during the time of Norway becoming an oil nation and being involved in the politics of the middle east etc. So it became a culturally relevant treasure as well. It is tradition to watch it on Christmas Eve for some reason :p 

This here in the post is the last one of three newer Flåklypa-movies. The setup is that the international agreement making it illegal for any nation to lay claim to the moon has become outdated and until the UN can hash out a new agreement, there is a pocket of a few weeks where the moon is up for grabs for any country who can get there as plant a flag. Once Solan/the bird of low morals, hears of the coming space race, several countries have begun their rocket construction with hilariously stereotypical rockets (the US' rocket is so big and overweight that it collapses on takeoff for instance. I think the Chinese rocket falls apart due to bad parts, etc.) and he gets the idea to get funding from the Norwegian government to build a rocket of their own.

There are some nice themes in the background, like how this mid level beurocrats starts to push for a bigger role in the whole thing and through his need for attention and career advancement ends up damaging the entire mission and becoming a bit of an antagonist, or how the hedgie at the beginning of this clip is a prominent local representative of the socialist liberal-conservative party and does little than ruin things with careless champagne-spills and attempting to steal the limelight of the actual inventor of the rocket (the bike repairman) and the austronauts (the bird and the beurocrat).

All in all. It's a very good movie and universe that is very Norwegian, but should be moderately enjoyable and interesting for everyone. So if you need some foreign cinema to check out, it has my Norwegian seal of approval.",,

""Following a gain of \~26.8% yesterday as the FDA briefing document noted positive benefit/risk of teplizumab, Provention Bio (NASDAQ:PRVB) has kept the momentum today rising \~4.7% in the pre-market amid favorable view from Wall Street. SVB Leerink argues that the document has removed a worst-case scenario for teplizumab which is under the regulatory review for the delay of progression to clinical type 1 diabetes (T1D) in at-risk patients. With an outperform rating, the firm estimates a price target of $16.00 for the stock implying an upside of \~58.1%.Noting an FDA document that is supportive of teplizumab efficacy, Cantor Fitzgerald considers the upcoming AdCom meeting as a major catalyst for the stock.Analyst Alethia Young has an outperform rating on the stock, and the price target of \~$19.00 per share implies an upside of \~87.7%.Previously, the analyst slashed the price target for Provention Bio by as much as \~36.0% after FDA cited deficiencies in the marketing application for teplizumab.""",,

———————-LEAKED SYNOPSIS———————-

With A flash of light and several yelps the bears dispersed and ran off into the woods. 

SPY opened her eyes and tried to focus them in the light to see her hero. JPOW takes his hand and gently brushes the market’s hair out of her eyes. She blushes. 

“Thank you for saving me from that terrible position. If he drilled another 7% I would never have been the same.”

JPOW looks deep into SPYs eyes. The energy around him shifts from a calming familiar friend to that of a sinister deviant. 

SPY senses she’s not out of harms way. She winced as JPOW leans in to her ear and whispers: “I put on my robe and wizard hat.”",,

With A flash of light and several yelps the bears dispersed and ran off into the woods. 

SPY opened her eyes and tried to focus them in the light to see her hero. JPOW takes his hand and gently brushes the market’s hair out of her eyes. She blushes. 

“Thank you for saving me from that terrible position. If he drilled another 7% I would never have been the same.”

JPOW looks deep into SPYs eyes. The energy around him shifts from a calming familiar friend to that of a sinister deviant. 

SPY senses she’s not out of harms way. She winced as JPOW leans in to her ear and whispers: “I put on my robe and wizard hat.”",,

They even list on their risks that “The market price and trading volume of shares... has been and may continue to be volatile, and purchasers of our securities could incur substantial losses” (p.3) ‼️

They have suffered the impact of Covid pretty hard, and for them to survive through the uncertainty relies on people going to the movie theatres... which is a risky activity to do during covid. 🦠💉🤧

Box office admissions - when you go to the theatre to watch a new movie, they are the first to license the preview (p.16). Because covid has disrupted the production of new films, AMC has less new releases to show.. plus with the closures of movie theatres across the US have “caused a substantial decline in sales” (p.7) 📉

So due to there being less people going to the theatres to watch movies, they are losing a lot of money, plus still bear the costs of all the properties they lease.. So they are burning cash by keeping theatres open, or still paying their leasing space while unable to keep the business open 🎬💸🔥

2. Food and beverage - their second largest source of income (p.16) Since covid they had to limit their menu, and also if there are less people going to the movies in general, there is less revenue from this. 🍿🍧🍭🍫

So pretty much if you don’t want AMC to go bankrupt, go to the movie theatres and treat yourself to some snacks! 🍿🐸☕️",,

While EXPI is doing 14.6 times the amount of selling that Zillow is it has a market cap that is 6.75 times less than Zillow. That means the EXPI could easily move up 6 times what it is trading at now.

EXPI also just increased their share buyback program from 75m to 475m. Which means they could buy a ton of stock and are probably going to announce a share buyback. Sending the already 54% insider owned stock absolutely skyrocketing due to them not selling the stock and supply running short.

They also are expanding into other countries right now and are on pace to be the largest worldwide real estate company.

2707,,2021-05-25 16:18:02,t3_nktkfy,,wallstreetbets,"The US House of Representatives passed a bill last month that would allow banks to provide services to cannabis companies in the US. Thus, the banks would no longer operate illegal and unlawful financing should they offer loans and other services to the companies. That would be a huge step in removing what analysts are calling an obstacle to the development of a national cannabis industry.

Legislators voted for the bill with 321-101 votes and sent it to the Senate.

https://preview.redd.it/5mpqdo4tja171.jpg?width=660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1255ec4f5a2471772ca27ad86ea25c16167d241b

The bill clarifies that proceeds from legal cannabis deals are not considered illegal and instructs federal regulators to create rules on how they would oversee such banking activities. Banks have so far been unwilling to do business with companies that sell marijuana or related products, fearing they could run into conflict with US federal law. This has left marijuana companies with few options to rely on a handful of small financial institutions or do cash deals. The American Bankers Association has aggressively lobbied for the SAFE Banking Act bill.

The banks have been in a difficult position due to the conflict between state and federal law, so it makes sense that Congress must act now to resolve this conflict. Thirty-six US states have now legalized medical cannabis, while 17 states already allow recreational use of cannabis by adults.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would try to push legislation. The positive reaction of the stock prices of Tilray, Sundial Growers, Aphria or Aurora Cannabis shows the great relief of investors. Investors hope that this could have kicked off further progressive reforms in the cannabis sector. This move took the potential of a game-changing marijuana law an important step forward.

If Congress passes the SAFE Banking Act and President Joe Biden signs it, it would likely become much easier and cheaper for marijuana companies to raise the capital they need to fund their growth initiatives. The law should also make cannabis companies safer and more efficient, as credit services would reduce the need for cash in day-to-day operations.

2711,,2021-05-25 17:28:55,t3_nkv7q2,,wallstreetbets,"Something interesting happened today. Vimeo, the video hosting service that is 100x better than YouTube but still nobody knows about (except losers like me) just had it's IPO today and it got fucked!

Currently the stock is down 15-20% from the opening bell. Who cares? Nobody is fever-buying IPOs like they were late last year or early this year. But this is actually the perfect time to buy in. Why? Well this IPO is actually occurring exactly when YouTube is just about to fuck over all of the business YouTube accounts in the USA.

What is YouTube doing to fuck over businesses? Well they are starting to run ads on non-partnered content. See source here, from the November terms of use update: [https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719)

If you don't want to read this, basically it says that channels that aren't partners are now going to get ads on their videos and YouTube is keeping ALL of the revenue (fuck you, right?). I've personally already witnessed this because I manage YT channels for several businesses and I've already gotten ads. And guess who gets a call every time their client sees an ad on their videos? Me, I get the call. 

&#x200B;

**When does this happen?**

It's already started. I've started seeing ads on corporate non-monetized and uncopyrighted videos within the last couple weeks, but the change is supposed to be implemented across the country in June. I've already been getting calls from my boss and from clients. We are already moving a lot of content to Vimeo.

&#x200B;

**Why does this matter?** 

Businesses are not going to be happy if their competitors are running ads on their videos. Especially if that ad occurs when the video is embedded on their own website. I know for a fact that ads are showing in YouTube but there has been no distinction that I'm aware of that would prohibit them from running ads in embedded videos on a website or blog. 

&#x200B;

**What is going to happen?**

If businesses start seeing competitor ads on their videos, they will do everything they can to stop it. They can either join the YPP and disable ads or they can leave the platform. However, there are requirements to the YPP:

1. They must have 1,000 subscribers
2. They must have 4,000 watch hours in the last 12 months

I can promise you that most businesses do not even come close to meeting these requirements. They can try to purchase subscribers or views but YouTube is good at identifying this. Trust me, I've gone down that road and have seen channels get taken down because of it.

&#x200B;

**Why is VMEO the best play here?**

The main reason is because businesses will leave YouTube.

Vimeo is hand-down my favorite video hosting service for a few reasons:

* The video encode quality is visibly better
* The embedded player is 100% customizable
* It's easier to pick thumbnails
* It has a built-in review system for businesses
* And the best feature, you can update videos without changing the URL (very helpful for embedding)

What's the drawback? It costs $7/month for most of these features. But businesses will gladly pay that to not have their competitors on their website/videos.

Positions: Shares 11 VMEO @ $43.25. I'll be loading up more soon.",nkv7q2,VMEO's IPO had perfect timing (and not by accident)

This is not a financial Advise,

RBLX has been on a bull run for past week and more. I wanted to to highlight few critical points here.

RBLX is approaching its resistance, Bearish in short term.  
It might fight $90 for 1 or 2 days, and then retrace to 21 ema (must be close to the ascending support line around $72) Wise decision would be to close a position now and re-enter at a lower price.  
Another data point to be cautions, analysts 12 month high price target - $90.

2715,,2021-05-25 19:36:59,t3_nky421,,wallstreetbets,"So a week ago I bought 4K in options for ARKX and UFO.  It started when I had the prophetic revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector. And because increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I stopped smoking weed.  My first thought was that if the government doesn’t release the report then I’m fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report sometime in June. However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it’s another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  After every national emergency, such as saying this is foreign tech would be, it has caused defense contract stocks to go up 5-10%. Also many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.  Finally I looked up ufo on google trends today and it is up 3x its 12 month average.  Google trends have been shown to foresee increase in prices.

GME has been consolidating between the bag holders of the first and second peaks. As you can see, on average, nobody is bag holding now. This is good sign for bulls. I would expect a retest of the 195/200 range. If that holds, it's game on.

&#x200B;

Mods, this is a technical analysis post...not a freaking literary dissertation. Having a length requirement on a post that is obviously going to mostly consist of a picture is ridiculous. Bad Bot.

&#x200B;

If we really need to get this longer then why don't I explain the significance of VWAP. It stands for volume weighted average price. It basically shows the price normalized by the volumes of buyers and sellers that have bought/sold in the past. Why is this important? It's important because it more accurately indicates where there are zones of overhead supply (bag holders waiting to sell once they break even) or pent up demand (most holders are feeling good and waiting to buy dips). In this case, price has been stuck between the psychology of two market participants; the bag holders and the (not?) bag holders. Now that price is above both VWAP levels, more market participants are ITM than not ITM. This means less selling pressure. This means moon.

Hello Hivemind,

From a fundamentalist and technical analysis perspective, I predict with a high degree of certainty that there will be strong price action coming within the next month, and I believe it'll be upward momentum. Here's why:

Fundamentally.  
\-Earnings are in a month. Here we may have another chance at the possibility of seeing the FB settlement or selling of Huwaei patents  
\-Earnings should beat last quarter. I promise you this hack on Colonial pipeline puckered a lot of businesses anuses and companies must all be looking at the best possible ways to increase their end-to-end security, also the shoutout from the hacker Darkside recommending Cyclance (IF the texts were real) is bigger than you think. Also, those of you who are invested and or bag holding should have also subscribed to Cyclance for $29, every one of those subscriptions helps their bottom line.  
\-Increase in advertisements. A lot more sponsored ads coming up on Reddit, Twitter, and also in other forms from Blackberry.  
\-No publicity is bad publicity. We still get connected with Jim Cramer's ""Reddit Stocks"" list on TV, but our price action never moves that drastically in comparison to the S&P 500. I have no doubt in my mind those who actually do their research, follow the price action, and the news from this company they'll see what treasure lies in store, but they could be looking for a better entry price. Currently, the average price target from CNN is $8.76 and $BB is very close as of writing at $8.60. Analyst projections going from $4.60 to $20. Following analyst's opinions are not always a great indicator, but this helps my prediction that there will be some turbulence will be coming soon, up or down.  
\-Massive institutional investment. I cannot stress this enough. Go on Fintel.io and you'll see recent additions to their portfolios from names like:  
\-Citadel. Bought 1,400,000 shares this quarter. Net Long on calls and puts  
\-Great West Life Assurance - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of New York - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of Montreal - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Many others, such as PrimeCap, Fidelity, and Vanguard  
Institutions are getting in, and heavily. there is a possibility that the price was beaten or manipulated down so institutions may enter at a cheap price but that's a different conversation, this is a conversation about $BB and the large chance of a movement, not manipulation.

Technical analysis.

&#x200B;

From this picture, we can see how the Bollinger bands are tightening up immensely, and we are about to see a triple cross of the 20/50/200 DMA. Both of these are signals of a large movement in price and if institutions are getting in so recently I couldn't imagine it's going to tank much further.  
An interesting note to make is how nicely the candles follow the Bollinger bands up and down, as well as when they touch the 50/200 DMA. Once the two cross that'll be either our death or golden cross. Hard to say which way, but I'd suggest it's up with all these companies are increasing their portfolio of $BB by 30%+.

This is the reason why I believe this is the signal. Call it apophenia if you aren't into TA but it can be an incredible tool for establishing share price.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9avjw90ltb171.png?width=2181&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f8c005da597398a5c107c70ab62c72b61d6e467

This chart shows the significance of \~$8.60 from history going back to April 2017 on the farthest left. The green dotted line shows how many times it acted as support but as well as resistance.  
This makes our current price range very strong because of how many times BB has touched \~$8.60. There have been times where it has tested below but eventually it has propped itself back up so far every time. It acted as resistance during the first stage of the WSB rally in January, came back down, and that was the signal to the upside.  
The next signal to the upside is \~$14.51 because of the yellow line. That was resistance during the WSB rally in which the daily candle spiked up and as well as acted at resistance on Jan 18 and as well after the crash.  
If $BB breaks \~$14.51 and secures it, $BB may go parabolic again.

But what if it goes down?  
The next support line below \~$8.60 is \~$6.50. But that probably won't happen because of $BB's Enterprise value. As of writing based the enterprise value is $4.98B and in comparison, our market cap is $4.81B, which puts BB's enterprise value and market cap very close in line with each other.

Final notes:  
I believe with a very high degree of confidence that $BB is going to move up now and we've reached very close to the bottom. I understand that it is impossible to predict the market but with these tools, research, my personal understanding of the market and its psychology involved, I think that $BB is primed and the uptrend may begin.

I am not your financial advisor. I am not a professional. I am only a mere student of the game which is life and the market.

I hold 2000 shares of BB and will be adding upon confirmation of the upside.

General Motors:

General Motors announced that it plans to invest $27 billion in EV and autonomous vehicles through 2025. The company also mentioned that it plans to release 30 EV models globally by 2025.

The company has partnered with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT in leading a $2 billion investment round in self-driving car startup Cruise LLC.

Difference:
Ford is going with Google and General Motors is going with Microsoft. 

Google has 14 Automotive startup investments and Acquisitions.

Microsoft only has investments in 4 automotive startups.

This will help Ford and General Motors in the following areas:

- Autonomous driving technology.
- Connected car tech & fleet management.
- Electric vehicle technology.
- Automotive retail.
- Mobility-as-a-service & shared mobility.

Who wins?
In this situation Ford has the better outlook, Google with 14 different Automotive startups to do its project development for Ford, also Google has access to Android and will give Ford the ability to integrate mobile connectivity to their cars.

Inflation matters because if inflation numbers come out just as high as last time, it will give more credence to the people screaming runaway inflation.

Runaway inflation is really bad because it will force the federal reserve to raise rates.

When rates rise, risk assets go poof.

Limit buy others do not fill except when price movement has gone below limit price.

Limit sell orders do not fill except when price movement has gone above limit price.

Then, if you want to use the Market order, it always shorthands you, making you buy at ludicriously high prices and forces you to sell at dirt cheap prices.

2746,,2021-05-26 01:53:20,t3_nl5li6,,wallstreetbets,"Heyoooooooooooo. 

Whatever I'm not here to impress you idiots with a catchy opening:

Lets look at NVDA. 

Looking at the stability (reddish line)

https://preview.redd.it/u10pl6qodd171.jpg?width=1154&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c6d6162ccd8ef4135b215f79f481d6327feb4bba

We see that for the past few months whenever the price has increased, it stretches the red line until it snaps back down. Is this occuring again with this most recent price increase? You tell me (yes). 

This is further worrisome when you look at the expected moves:

https://preview.redd.it/zrbvo6a0ed171.jpg?width=1122&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0e50c0dfe36958ff7447f95dc071b13fd21fb0c3

Although earnings are coming up and they can be more drastic than normal, typically MM's and OD's don't enjoy greater-than-expected moves. 

The shorts are doing a fun dance:

https://preview.redd.it/t5b3qyp5ed171.jpg?width=1122&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e6fe8bc1ed2dc94b1cd3b184d6c954b543ba3688

The most recent price increases have been met with greater increases in shorting. This can be from a variety of reasons but globally seen as a bit of a bearish sign.

The options layout:

https://preview.redd.it/4jvpzchbed171.jpg?width=1116&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5732c90ccbf63e01f50240c13cb35a7f92820d40

The concerning aspect here is the largest majority of calls are at $600 (ITM) at \~30,000 of them. 

This produces:

https://preview.redd.it/apxxpm6ied171.jpg?width=1095&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=34d04c8afd050167a62de53d532b49e3a1d3c009

Since those options are so ITM and volatility tends to move around earnings reports, let's look at how the options will effect the price if volatility increases:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rmnd65mped171.jpg?width=346&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de87aabdccf8254bc8d3bdf0f482dafefdf71d99

So there are approximately 10,000,000 more shares that have to be sold with increases in volatility than purchased. So if tomorrow, volatility rises - I'd say be cautious. But if it is good news and liquidity becomes abundant, then everything favors an upside. 

There will be some mighty resistance, however - namely those 30k calls at $600. Overall, I'd be slightly gay bearish for the next week or so until either those calls are moved further upland or the price reverts back down.",nl5li6,NVDA DD
2747,,2021-05-26 01:58:06,t3_nl5oiw,,wallstreetbets,"MVIS DD 05/25

 

Hey  guys! Long time no see. Its been an exciting day for MVIS so I though  you guys might be interested in seeing the options landscape.

The  stability metric has been all over the place the past week - probably  like some of your heart rates. Looking at my stability metric, you can  see (at first) some chaos but it appears there is a nice pattern  emerging:

https://preview.redd.it/ssgru1aqbd171.jpg?width=1358&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f963b7200071d3ab7a38276a0325a9929a62b72b

&#x200B;

Initially  the stability dropped well down (purple line) with the price drop and  it kinda, hovered? there. But now the purple line's trend is upwards -  this is obviously a good sign with the price also increasing. Typically I  am skeptical of price increases and the stability metric either doesn't  move or even decreases. But in this case, it seems MVIS was becoming  pretty stable with its new price.

Looking at the expected movements:

https://preview.redd.it/e1bor0qsbd171.jpg?width=1339&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c941dddd7e584037eca3c436d4d7935cd2525d0

&#x200B;

Today's  movements were just touching the top band. So perhaps tomorrow will be a  little bit of a mean reversion day but overall the trend may be picking  up in the positive direction.

Looking at the options landscape:

https://preview.redd.it/vaj79lxwbd171.jpg?width=1363&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20cfee7635a4cff061b080e971c1e19ca1a62786

The graphs are the same but the graph on the left show which options have greatest sensitivity to volatility (blue)

The  only concern here is that I've noticed whenever a stock over-takes a  large section of options (such as here at $15 where there is \~25k calls)  there is usually a bit of resistance. When people do 'technical  analysis' and talk about 'resistance points' they are usually indirectly  pointing out the areas with large option placements.

Looking at the options positioning:

https://preview.redd.it/kwkpy1hzbd171.jpg?width=1344&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9bb7287184bb917592177300b0a356c1c6b224a8

&#x200B;

Reasonably  healthy option behavior. There is about 225k options that have to be  hedged if volatility drops and 190k if vol spikes. This is kinda  interesting (and kinda unusual) in that as a stock becomes more healthy  it typically becomes more liquid. In this case this will cause the  options to have to be hedged via purchasing. This is fine in so long as  liquidity stays low - if liquidity dries up then selling occurs. Without  much more on one side or the other, this usually plays out with a bit  of stagnation.

Lastly, the shorts:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/folrpww1cd171.jpg?width=1324&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfb63529bb20e813ca28580e21031440efae9dac

Another  indication of good news: the shorting has been consistently well below  the running average lately. Is this because there are few shorts left or  because few purchasers? That's hard to say but overall it is usually a  good sign, especially on positive price days.

Overall,  it doesn't look too bad for MVIS - although it might experience some  mean reversion or a slight push back down to $15 to push those (now) ITM  calls back OTM, but I don't see anything that screams big downside just  yet.

Good luck!",nl5oiw,$MVIS DD by u/hiddengooru (mods let this man post)
2748,,2021-05-26 02:01:56,t3_nl5r2e,,wallstreetbets,"I dont need to tell you about the trajectory of SNDL as a state-of-the-art licensed producer of cannabis. Part of this unstoppable trajectory is due to their strategy, industry leading technology/approach, clean balance sheet and vast amount of cash reserves they  have recently raised. Currently sitting close to a Billion dollars in cash. The question is, how can it put these resources to the best strategic use?

\-SNDL has recently announced a string of acquisitions that piece together the necessary components to emerge as the winner in the newly budding cannabis industry in North America. As US legislation at a federal level approaches, the flood gates are soon to open.  The recent acquisitions include the following:

1)Zenabis- Near the end of 2020, SNDL announced they closed the acquisition of a special purpose vehicle used to takeover a subsidiary of Zenabis Global, owning $58.9 million worth of senior secured debt of Zenabis Global. Much to the surprise of SNDL, wews abruptly came that H.E.X.0. would be acquiring Zenabis gloabl in $235 million stock deal to expand their global presence.  Despite having the cash and being ready to pull the trigger, SNDL leanred a valuable lesson not to wait too long..

2) Inner Spirit holdings- A retailer and franchisor of recreational cannabis stores. This helps increase it's market share and geographic footprint in North America. Purchased for only $106.7M. This time around, SNDL did not wait and succesfully acquired this company for strategic purposes.

3) Recently SNDL, acquired a 10% stake in The Valens Company. A growing parts supplier and leader in extraction, analysis of cannabis would make Valens an ideal fit for the growing brand and empire of Sundial. To have bought stock in the market would likely mean that an attempt to buy the company was already made. Sundial likley approached VLNS for an acquisition earlier, but when management turned down the offer they proceeded to accumulate stock.  The Valens company would be a perfect fit for Sundials future potential. 

Today VLNS announced a bought-deal offering. This leaves the door open to a few alternatives:

\-Valens mgmt is trying to avoid an outright acquisition at this time in order to further seed a strategic investor (SNDL) knowing that there will be a take-out at somepoint in teh near future.  SNDL is sitting on a billion cash, will be able to increase it's stake in the company further through this deal in order to accumulate more voteing authority over the company. Howver if the need arises, SNDL has more than enough bullets to go hostile and acquire VLNS at a premium. 

So WHAT do we DO?

I think we continue to support SNDL buying stock to support our name. Annnnd since we know that SNDL has it's eyes on VLNS ([VLNS.CA](https://VLNS.CA) \+VLNCF  US) which it may acquire in the near future at a premium. We should also buy VLNS stock so that we have the ability to tender our votes if an acquisiton were voted on. We also get the added benefit of having our VLNS shares acquired for a premium. Win-Win.

&#x200B;

Thoughts???",nl5r2e,SNDL is building an empire and VLNS is the missing piece
2749,,2021-05-26 02:02:42,t3_nl5rju,,wallstreetbets,"tl;dr - $GME is still very cheap. Even if, like me, you don't buy the 6+ digits hype, this short essay will show potential for at least a few thousand dollars per share. BUY, HOLD, VOTE (not financial advice, yada yada).

\---

1) Basics - Forget the whole squeeze for a moment and lets consider just the business opportunity, comparing to Amazon. In 1999, when they barely sold anything beyond entertainment (so, similar to GME business model henceforth), AMZN market cap was USD 30 B in a USD 10 T GDP environment. GDP is double that now, so we can infer that a well managed company similar to 1999's Amazon is worth now USD 60 B. That alone puts $GME stock in the USD 800\~1,000 ballpark. GME is capitalising on this whole drama by revamping the business model and management, paying debt, etc. They became a sexy company, have cash to invest and attract talent, tons of exposure / publicity and the sympathy by public. They are positioning to become the biggest player in the entertainment niche (games) that will grow the most for many years.

2) Meme stock multiplier - We all saw what becoming a meme did to $TSLA from 2019 on, and all the noise by paid agents trying to mimic the effect by pumping other stocks here in r/wallstreetbets ever since. GME is already a meme stock and thus those USD 800\~1,000 will eventually turn into USD 3,000\~5,000 as they revamp their operations and shift from brick and mortar to digital. Every new product or service will be a new hype.

3) The squeeze potential - The great unknown, thus I'll not digress much about it. Can be a mirage, can be something that will spike 10x from above figures, who knows? I don't believe in 6 digits per share, but maybe low 5s if indeed they find out more votes than shares? I'm not sophisticated enough to understand the possible MOASS, but my whole point here in this post is to show that MOASS, if it ever happens, is a bonus. GME is a strong BUY (and HOLD and VOTE) regardless. But just in case I'm buying a few Calls too.

Popped my DD cherry. Hope it helps.

The top line fell short of estimates by 5%.

And it's not just a case of a tough quarter. The company's EPS growth rate started declining consistently in 2017 and turned into outright losses for fiscal 2021, which ended in January. Meanwhile, GME stock's sales posted an 18% annualized drop in the past three years.

Note from Spotgamma on SPX: ""We are still watching the “void” that has formed below 4175. It would take a break of 4160, but as you can see in the EquityHub view of SPX, gamma changes quite sharply down to 4055. We interpret this sharp gamma change as “volatility fuels” and therefore anticipate a fast move to 4055 if 4160 breaks.

# TA Notes: Looking for low volatility today

* Bulls need to break 420.73 for bullish 🎯
* Bears need to break 417.75 for bearish 🎯

2790,,2021-05-26 13:09:16,t3_nlgn02,,wallstreetbets,,nlgn02,Greetings from Germany 💎🙌
2791,,2021-05-26 13:10:02,t3_nlgnl0,,wallstreetbets,"
• The first patient with SPMS was dosed on May 24, 2021 with nasally administered Foralumab.  The treatment regimen will continue for six months to examine long-term safety, tolerability and clinical responses.
• Previous clinical studies in healthy volunteers and COVID-19 patients showed that the nasally administered Foralumab is well-tolerated with no apparent severe adverse events (SAEs) when dosed for up to 10 consecutive days. Results from these studies showed strong anti-inflammatory effects of the treatment regimen.
 
New York/London, 25 May 2021 – Tiziana Life Sciences plc (NASDAQ: TLSA, LSE: TILS) (“Tiziana” or the “Company”), a biotechnology company focused on innovative therapeutics for inflammatory diseases and cancers, is pleased to announce that the first patient with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) was dosed with nasally administered Foralumab, a fully human anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody, at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH), Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA. Nasal Foralumab 50 mcg (25 mcg/nostril) will be administered in 3-week cycles, with 3 times/week dosing for the first 2 weeks followed by 1 week of rest period. This first-ever clinical study in SPMS patients, under an Individual Patient Expanded Access IND, will continue for six months to evaluate routine safety, tolerability, and neurological behaviors. The study will also examine microglial activation, by positron emission tomography (PET), immunological and neurodegenerative markers to assess clinical responses following the treatment regimen.
Previously, Tiziana completed a Phase 1 trial of a single-site, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose (MAD) once a day dosing for 5 consecutive days with nasally administered Foralumab in healthy subjects. The treatment was well-tolerated with no drug-related safety issues reported at doses of up to 250 mcg. (https://www.tizianalifesciences.com/news-item?s=2019-09-10-tiziana-reports-phase-1-clinical-data-demonstrating-nasal-treatment-with-foralumab-was-well-tolerated-and-produced-positive-trend-in-biomarkers-of-immunomodulation-and-anti-inflammation-in-healthy-volunteers)
Subsequently, Tiziana reported positive data from the clinical study with nasally administered Foralumab in COVID-19 patients in Brazil. Results from this clinical study demonstrated that nasally administered Foralumab at 100 mcg/day for consecutive 10 days was well-tolerated and there were no apparent severe adverse events. The clinical results demonstrated that the treatment provided significant reduction of lung inflammation together with a reduction in interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP), biomarkers of inflammation, in the blood samples taken from patients ( https://www.tizianalifesciences.com/news-item?s=2021-02-02-tiziana-reports-positive-data-from-the-clinical-study-of-nasal-administration-with-foralumab-its-proprietary-fully-human-anti-cd3-monoclonal-antibody-in-covid-19-patients-in-brazil)
 
Dr. Howard Weiner, Robert Kroc Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School said, “Nasally administered anti-CD3 is an exciting, novel approach that has the ability to provide safe treatment for a form of MS that currently has no effective treatment. We are excited to examine this first-in-class approach to treat patients with SPMS for whom no effective treatment option is currently available.”
Dr. Tanuja Chitnis, Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School and senior neurologist at the BWH, adds, “Effective and targeted treatments for progressive MS are urgently needed. Nasal Foralumab could revolutionize treatment for this disabling form of disease.”  
The person who arranged for the release of this announcement on behalf of the Company was Dr Kunwar Shailubhai, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Scientific Officer of the Company.
 
THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSES OF ARTICLE 7 OF REGULATION 2014/596/EU (WHICH FORMS PART OF DOMESTIC UK LAW PURSUANT TO THE EUROPEAN UNION (WITHDRAWAL) ACT 2018) (""UK MAR""). UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, THIS INSIDE INFORMATION (AS DEFINED IN UK MAR) IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.

About Foralumab
Foralumab (formerly NI-0401), the only entirely human anti-CD3 mAb, shows reduced release of cytokines after IV administration in patients with Crohn's disease with decreases in the classic side effects of cytokine release syndrome and improves the overall safety profile of Foralumab. In a humanized mouse model (NOD/SCID IL2γc-/-), it was shown that whilst targeting the T cell receptor, orally administered Foralumab modulates immune responses of the T cells, enhances regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and thus provides therapeutic benefit in treating inflammatory and autoimmune diseases without the occurrence of potential adverse events usually associated with parenteral mAb therapy (Ogura M. et al., 2017). Based on animal studies, the nasal and oral administration of Foralumab offers the potential for the immunotherapy of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases in a safe manner by the induction of Tregs.
About Tiziana Life SciencesTiziana Life Sciences plc is a dual listed (NASDAQ: TLSA, UK LSE: TILS) biotechnology company that focuses on the discovery and development of novel molecules to treat human diseases in oncology, inflammation and infectious diseases. In addition to Milciclib, the Company will be shortly initiating Phase 2 studies with orally administered Foralumab for Crohn’s Disease and nasally administered Foralumab for progressive multiple sclerosis. Foralumab is the only fully human anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (“mAb”) in clinical development in the world. This Phase 2 compound has potential application in a wide range of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, such as Crohn’s Disease, multiple sclerosis, type-1 diabetes (“T1D”), inflammatory bowel disease (“IBD”), psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, where modulation of a T-cell response is desirable. The Company is accelerating development of anti-Interleukin 6 receptor (“IL6R”) mAb, a fully human monoclonal antibody for treatment of IL6-induced inflammation, especially for treatment of COVID-19 patients.

My mother was a fifteen year old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. My father would womanize, he would drink, he would make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark. Some times he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy, the sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament. My childhood was typical, summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring we'd make meat helmets. When I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds, pretty standard really. At the age of 12 I received my first scribe. At the age of fourteen, a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles. There really is nothing like a shorn scrotum, it's breathtaking, I suggest you try it.""",,

AMC is currently trading at a $9000mm market cap... prepandemic levels placed this at $600mm.

AMC has had **no bullish news** for **years**.

The stock is relying *entirely on buy pressure that is detached from the company's actual value.* This **only works in tech companies, because you're investing in the technology and market ownership**.

AMC has **no room to grow in the cinema industry in the USA**. 

AMC has diluted shares from 50m to 500m... raising **billions of dollars**. They **still have debt**.

So why is GME better? Because it *doesn't need a squeeze.* It has more investors, despite what forum sliders want you to believe. It has institutional investors, because of the fundamental value proposition posed by Ryan Cohen and the team they're building.

The company has 99% market share to grow into, and an exploding technological industry to take advantage of. Theyre rapidly and radically transforming their product offerings and their delivery models.

The stock is still undervalue.

If RC had launched a startup with the same vision that Gamestop has... it would be valued *more than Gamestop currently is* at its IPO.

Gamestop has an established customer base, that is now expanding into Europe.

Wake up guys.

AMC isn't it. It never was. It never will be. They aren't working with Gamestop.

Gamestop is safe on its own strengths. It doesn't need a squeeze. It will continue to grow overtime regardless.",,

If you are selling the CC, and it gets exercised, then you have to sell 100 shares of AMC at $15/share. If you own the shares for less than $15, your only real exposure is that you will not get any gains <$15/share.

So right now, I have a bunch of calls I sold at $16/share. If the price point is still <$16 on the exercise date (here 6/11), then I will be forced to sell my shares for $16/share, regardless of current value. So if they are, say, $30/share... then I will not make any of that money. Big bummer, but I win either way.

If you *strongly* believe your meme is higher quality than all the memes currently on r/wallstreetbets/hot, then you may message the moderators.

I know this is disappointing, and you probably put some hard work into this, but this is how we keep the WSB feeds clean for everyone, including the /new feed.

Ford’s plan to invest in EVs and self-driving cars rose to $29 billion, including $22 billion for EVs through 2025. 

Ford and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL are entering a six-year deal that will make the tech giant responsible for much of Ford’s growing in-vehicle connectivity. This partnership is designed to streamline Ford’s operations and accelerate an ongoing $11 billion restructuring plan. 

General Motors:

General Motors announced that it plans to invest $27 billion in EV and autonomous vehicles through 2025. The company also mentioned that it plans to release 30 EV models globally by 2025.

The company has partnered with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT in leading a $2 billion investment round in self-driving car startup Cruise LLC.

Difference:
Ford is going with Google and General Motors is going with Microsoft. 

Google has 14 Automotive startup investments and Acquisitions.

Microsoft only has investments in 4 automotive startups.

This will help Ford and General Motors in the following areas:

- Autonomous driving technology.
- Connected car tech & fleet management.
- Electric vehicle technology.
- Automotive retail.
- Mobility-as-a-service & shared mobility.

Who wins?
In this situation Ford has the better outlook, Google with 14 different Automotive startups to do its project development for Ford, also Google has access to Android and will give Ford the ability to integrate mobile connectivity to their cars.

I will keep buying Ford, because of the potential technology integration.

CPI = measure of inflation

Inflation matters because if inflation numbers come out just as high as last time, it will give more credence to the people screaming runaway inflation.

Runaway inflation is really bad because it will force the federal reserve to raise rates.

When rates rise, risk assets go poof.

Stocks and coins will either finally be dead or return to the atmosphere on this day.

>**BEAR** You hate the government. Inflation is here to stay from reckless printing. You think CPI will come out sky high, the highest financial authority of the land will be publicly embarrassed and raise rates.

As SpaceX is not directly publicly tradable (though tied to Tesla), invest in the company that supplies the concrete/labor to repair the launchpad SpaceX uses for their rockets/tests the most.

SpaceX is not going to stop trying new stuff anytime in the near future and they are not afraid to blow stuff up (starship --- cough ---) in order to iterate on their design faster. That being said, someone out there has to actually do the repairs and supply the materials needed for the repairs to their facility.

If we can find the repair crew/supplier for SpaceX, and invest in them, then we are basically ""betting"" on SpaceX doing well (more explosions and repairs in the future).",nl5ehp,Can't invest in SpaceX but you can invest in Concrete
6382,,2021-05-26 01:53:20,t3_nl5li6,,wallstreetbets,"Heyoooooooooooo. 

Whatever I'm not here to impress you idiots with a catchy opening:

Lets look at NVDA. 

Looking at the stability (reddish line)

https://preview.redd.it/u10pl6qodd171.jpg?width=1154&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c6d6162ccd8ef4135b215f79f481d6327feb4bba

We see that for the past few months whenever the price has increased, it stretches the red line until it snaps back down. Is this occuring again with this most recent price increase? You tell me (yes). 

This is further worrisome when you look at the expected moves:

https://preview.redd.it/zrbvo6a0ed171.jpg?width=1122&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0e50c0dfe36958ff7447f95dc071b13fd21fb0c3

Although earnings are coming up and they can be more drastic than normal, typically MM's and OD's don't enjoy greater-than-expected moves. 

The shorts are doing a fun dance:

https://preview.redd.it/t5b3qyp5ed171.jpg?width=1122&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e6fe8bc1ed2dc94b1cd3b184d6c954b543ba3688

The most recent price increases have been met with greater increases in shorting. This can be from a variety of reasons but globally seen as a bit of a bearish sign.

The options layout:

https://preview.redd.it/4jvpzchbed171.jpg?width=1116&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5732c90ccbf63e01f50240c13cb35a7f92820d40

The concerning aspect here is the largest majority of calls are at $600 (ITM) at \~30,000 of them. 

This produces:

https://preview.redd.it/apxxpm6ied171.jpg?width=1095&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=34d04c8afd050167a62de53d532b49e3a1d3c009

Since those options are so ITM and volatility tends to move around earnings reports, let's look at how the options will effect the price if volatility increases:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rmnd65mped171.jpg?width=346&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de87aabdccf8254bc8d3bdf0f482dafefdf71d99

So there are approximately 10,000,000 more shares that have to be sold with increases in volatility than purchased. So if tomorrow, volatility rises - I'd say be cautious. But if it is good news and liquidity becomes abundant, then everything favors an upside. 

There will be some mighty resistance, however - namely those 30k calls at $600. Overall, I'd be slightly gay bearish for the next week or so until either those calls are moved further upland or the price reverts back down.",nl5li6,NVDA DD
6383,,2021-05-26 01:58:06,t3_nl5oiw,,wallstreetbets,"MVIS DD 05/25

 

Hey  guys! Long time no see. Its been an exciting day for MVIS so I though  you guys might be interested in seeing the options landscape.

The  stability metric has been all over the place the past week - probably  like some of your heart rates. Looking at my stability metric, you can  see (at first) some chaos but it appears there is a nice pattern  emerging:

https://preview.redd.it/ssgru1aqbd171.jpg?width=1358&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f963b7200071d3ab7a38276a0325a9929a62b72b

&#x200B;

Initially  the stability dropped well down (purple line) with the price drop and  it kinda, hovered? there. But now the purple line's trend is upwards -  this is obviously a good sign with the price also increasing. Typically I  am skeptical of price increases and the stability metric either doesn't  move or even decreases. But in this case, it seems MVIS was becoming  pretty stable with its new price.

Looking at the expected movements:

https://preview.redd.it/e1bor0qsbd171.jpg?width=1339&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c941dddd7e584037eca3c436d4d7935cd2525d0

&#x200B;

Today's  movements were just touching the top band. So perhaps tomorrow will be a  little bit of a mean reversion day but overall the trend may be picking  up in the positive direction.

Looking at the options landscape:

https://preview.redd.it/vaj79lxwbd171.jpg?width=1363&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20cfee7635a4cff061b080e971c1e19ca1a62786

The graphs are the same but the graph on the left show which options have greatest sensitivity to volatility (blue)

The  only concern here is that I've noticed whenever a stock over-takes a  large section of options (such as here at $15 where there is \~25k calls)  there is usually a bit of resistance. When people do 'technical  analysis' and talk about 'resistance points' they are usually indirectly  pointing out the areas with large option placements.

Looking at the options positioning:

https://preview.redd.it/kwkpy1hzbd171.jpg?width=1344&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9bb7287184bb917592177300b0a356c1c6b224a8

&#x200B;

Reasonably  healthy option behavior. There is about 225k options that have to be  hedged if volatility drops and 190k if vol spikes. This is kinda  interesting (and kinda unusual) in that as a stock becomes more healthy  it typically becomes more liquid. In this case this will cause the  options to have to be hedged via purchasing. This is fine in so long as  liquidity stays low - if liquidity dries up then selling occurs. Without  much more on one side or the other, this usually plays out with a bit  of stagnation.

Lastly, the shorts:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/folrpww1cd171.jpg?width=1324&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfb63529bb20e813ca28580e21031440efae9dac

Another  indication of good news: the shorting has been consistently well below  the running average lately. Is this because there are few shorts left or  because few purchasers? That's hard to say but overall it is usually a  good sign, especially on positive price days.

Overall,  it doesn't look too bad for MVIS - although it might experience some  mean reversion or a slight push back down to $15 to push those (now) ITM  calls back OTM, but I don't see anything that screams big downside just  yet.

Good luck!",nl5oiw,$MVIS DD by u/hiddengooru (mods let this man post)
6384,,2021-05-26 02:01:56,t3_nl5r2e,,wallstreetbets,"I dont need to tell you about the trajectory of SNDL as a state-of-the-art licensed producer of cannabis. Part of this unstoppable trajectory is due to their strategy, industry leading technology/approach, clean balance sheet and vast amount of cash reserves they  have recently raised. Currently sitting close to a Billion dollars in cash. The question is, how can it put these resources to the best strategic use?

\-SNDL has recently announced a string of acquisitions that piece together the necessary components to emerge as the winner in the newly budding cannabis industry in North America. As US legislation at a federal level approaches, the flood gates are soon to open.  The recent acquisitions include the following:

1)Zenabis- Near the end of 2020, SNDL announced they closed the acquisition of a special purpose vehicle used to takeover a subsidiary of Zenabis Global, owning $58.9 million worth of senior secured debt of Zenabis Global. Much to the surprise of SNDL, wews abruptly came that H.E.X.0. would be acquiring Zenabis gloabl in $235 million stock deal to expand their global presence.  Despite having the cash and being ready to pull the trigger, SNDL leanred a valuable lesson not to wait too long..

2) Inner Spirit holdings- A retailer and franchisor of recreational cannabis stores. This helps increase it's market share and geographic footprint in North America. Purchased for only $106.7M. This time around, SNDL did not wait and succesfully acquired this company for strategic purposes.

3) Recently SNDL, acquired a 10% stake in The Valens Company. A growing parts supplier and leader in extraction, analysis of cannabis would make Valens an ideal fit for the growing brand and empire of Sundial. To have bought stock in the market would likely mean that an attempt to buy the company was already made. Sundial likley approached VLNS for an acquisition earlier, but when management turned down the offer they proceeded to accumulate stock.  The Valens company would be a perfect fit for Sundials future potential. 

Today VLNS announced a bought-deal offering. This leaves the door open to a few alternatives:

\-Valens mgmt is trying to avoid an outright acquisition at this time in order to further seed a strategic investor (SNDL) knowing that there will be a take-out at somepoint in teh near future.  SNDL is sitting on a billion cash, will be able to increase it's stake in the company further through this deal in order to accumulate more voteing authority over the company. Howver if the need arises, SNDL has more than enough bullets to go hostile and acquire VLNS at a premium. 

So WHAT do we DO?

I think we continue to support SNDL buying stock to support our name. Annnnd since we know that SNDL has it's eyes on VLNS ([VLNS.CA](https://VLNS.CA) \+VLNCF  US) which it may acquire in the near future at a premium. We should also buy VLNS stock so that we have the ability to tender our votes if an acquisiton were voted on. We also get the added benefit of having our VLNS shares acquired for a premium. Win-Win.

6385,,2021-05-26 02:02:42,t3_nl5rju,,wallstreetbets,"tl;dr - $GME is still very cheap. Even if, like me, you don't buy the 6+ digits hype, this short essay will show potential for at least a few thousand dollars per share. BUY, HOLD, VOTE (not financial advice, yada yada).

\---

1) Basics - Forget the whole squeeze for a moment and lets consider just the business opportunity, comparing to Amazon. In 1999, when they barely sold anything beyond entertainment (so, similar to GME business model henceforth), AMZN market cap was USD 30 B in a USD 10 T GDP environment. GDP is double that now, so we can infer that a well managed company similar to 1999's Amazon is worth now USD 60 B. That alone puts $GME stock in the USD 800\~1,000 ballpark. GME is capitalising on this whole drama by revamping the business model and management, paying debt, etc. They became a sexy company, have cash to invest and attract talent, tons of exposure / publicity and the sympathy by public. They are positioning to become the biggest player in the entertainment niche (games) that will grow the most for many years.

2) Meme stock multiplier - We all saw what becoming a meme did to $TSLA from 2019 on, and all the noise by paid agents trying to mimic the effect by pumping other stocks here in r/wallstreetbets ever since. GME is already a meme stock and thus those USD 800\~1,000 will eventually turn into USD 3,000\~5,000 as they revamp their operations and shift from brick and mortar to digital. Every new product or service will be a new hype.

3) The squeeze potential - The great unknown, thus I'll not digress much about it. Can be a mirage, can be something that will spike 10x from above figures, who knows? I don't believe in 6 digits per share, but maybe low 5s if indeed they find out more votes than shares? I'm not sophisticated enough to understand the possible MOASS, but my whole point here in this post is to show that MOASS, if it ever happens, is a bonus. GME is a strong BUY (and HOLD and VOTE) regardless. But just in case I'm buying a few Calls too.

Popped my DD cherry. Hope it helps.

The top line fell short of estimates by 5%.

And it's not just a case of a tough quarter. The company's EPS growth rate started declining consistently in 2017 and turned into outright losses for fiscal 2021, which ended in January. Meanwhile, GME stock's sales posted an 18% annualized drop in the past three years.

Note from Spotgamma on SPX: ""We are still watching the “void” that has formed below 4175. It would take a break of 4160, but as you can see in the EquityHub view of SPX, gamma changes quite sharply down to 4055. We interpret this sharp gamma change as “volatility fuels” and therefore anticipate a fast move to 4055 if 4160 breaks.

# TA Notes: Looking for low volatility today

* Bulls need to break 420.73 for bullish 🎯
* Bears need to break 417.75 for bearish 🎯
* Support at SMMAs
* Could see the 120 SMMA tested today so keep an eye if it doesn't hold.
* If 420.73 breaks, look for bullish 🎯 : 422.43 - 423.81 - 425.15
* If 417.25 breaks, look for bearish 🎯 : 416 - 415 - 414.13 - 412.74 - 411.26 - 410
* Please not that if we push below 415 we could see downwards pressure to 405.

# 15min. Time-frame RSI

* Bulls need 70 - 77.543 - 87.99
* Still in downtrend
* Bears need 41.51 - 37.22 - 22.99 - 16.08

• The first patient with SPMS was dosed on May 24, 2021 with nasally administered Foralumab.  The treatment regimen will continue for six months to examine long-term safety, tolerability and clinical responses.
• Previous clinical studies in healthy volunteers and COVID-19 patients showed that the nasally administered Foralumab is well-tolerated with no apparent severe adverse events (SAEs) when dosed for up to 10 consecutive days. Results from these studies showed strong anti-inflammatory effects of the treatment regimen.
 
New York/London, 25 May 2021 – Tiziana Life Sciences plc (NASDAQ: TLSA, LSE: TILS) (“Tiziana” or the “Company”), a biotechnology company focused on innovative therapeutics for inflammatory diseases and cancers, is pleased to announce that the first patient with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) was dosed with nasally administered Foralumab, a fully human anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody, at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH), Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA. Nasal Foralumab 50 mcg (25 mcg/nostril) will be administered in 3-week cycles, with 3 times/week dosing for the first 2 weeks followed by 1 week of rest period. This first-ever clinical study in SPMS patients, under an Individual Patient Expanded Access IND, will continue for six months to evaluate routine safety, tolerability, and neurological behaviors. The study will also examine microglial activation, by positron emission tomography (PET), immunological and neurodegenerative markers to assess clinical responses following the treatment regimen.
Previously, Tiziana completed a Phase 1 trial of a single-site, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose (MAD) once a day dosing for 5 consecutive days with nasally administered Foralumab in healthy subjects. The treatment was well-tolerated with no drug-related safety issues reported at doses of up to 250 mcg. (https://www.tizianalifesciences.com/news-item?s=2019-09-10-tiziana-reports-phase-1-clinical-data-demonstrating-nasal-treatment-with-foralumab-was-well-tolerated-and-produced-positive-trend-in-biomarkers-of-immunomodulation-and-anti-inflammation-in-healthy-volunteers)
Subsequently, Tiziana reported positive data from the clinical study with nasally administered Foralumab in COVID-19 patients in Brazil. Results from this clinical study demonstrated that nasally administered Foralumab at 100 mcg/day for consecutive 10 days was well-tolerated and there were no apparent severe adverse events. The clinical results demonstrated that the treatment provided significant reduction of lung inflammation together with a reduction in interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP), biomarkers of inflammation, in the blood samples taken from patients ( https://www.tizianalifesciences.com/news-item?s=2021-02-02-tiziana-reports-positive-data-from-the-clinical-study-of-nasal-administration-with-foralumab-its-proprietary-fully-human-anti-cd3-monoclonal-antibody-in-covid-19-patients-in-brazil)
 
Dr. Howard Weiner, Robert Kroc Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School said, “Nasally administered anti-CD3 is an exciting, novel approach that has the ability to provide safe treatment for a form of MS that currently has no effective treatment. We are excited to examine this first-in-class approach to treat patients with SPMS for whom no effective treatment option is currently available.”
Dr. Tanuja Chitnis, Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School and senior neurologist at the BWH, adds, “Effective and targeted treatments for progressive MS are urgently needed. Nasal Foralumab could revolutionize treatment for this disabling form of disease.”  
The person who arranged for the release of this announcement on behalf of the Company was Dr Kunwar Shailubhai, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Scientific Officer of the Company.
 
THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSES OF ARTICLE 7 OF REGULATION 2014/596/EU (WHICH FORMS PART OF DOMESTIC UK LAW PURSUANT TO THE EUROPEAN UNION (WITHDRAWAL) ACT 2018) (""UK MAR""). UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, THIS INSIDE INFORMATION (AS DEFINED IN UK MAR) IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.

About Foralumab
Foralumab (formerly NI-0401), the only entirely human anti-CD3 mAb, shows reduced release of cytokines after IV administration in patients with Crohn's disease with decreases in the classic side effects of cytokine release syndrome and improves the overall safety profile of Foralumab. In a humanized mouse model (NOD/SCID IL2γc-/-), it was shown that whilst targeting the T cell receptor, orally administered Foralumab modulates immune responses of the T cells, enhances regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and thus provides therapeutic benefit in treating inflammatory and autoimmune diseases without the occurrence of potential adverse events usually associated with parenteral mAb therapy (Ogura M. et al., 2017). Based on animal studies, the nasal and oral administration of Foralumab offers the potential for the immunotherapy of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases in a safe manner by the induction of Tregs.
About Tiziana Life SciencesTiziana Life Sciences plc is a dual listed (NASDAQ: TLSA, UK LSE: TILS) biotechnology company that focuses on the discovery and development of novel molecules to treat human diseases in oncology, inflammation and infectious diseases. In addition to Milciclib, the Company will be shortly initiating Phase 2 studies with orally administered Foralumab for Crohn’s Disease and nasally administered Foralumab for progressive multiple sclerosis. Foralumab is the only fully human anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (“mAb”) in clinical development in the world. This Phase 2 compound has potential application in a wide range of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, such as Crohn’s Disease, multiple sclerosis, type-1 diabetes (“T1D”), inflammatory bowel disease (“IBD”), psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, where modulation of a T-cell response is desirable. The Company is accelerating development of anti-Interleukin 6 receptor (“IL6R”) mAb, a fully human monoclonal antibody for treatment of IL6-induced inflammation, especially for treatment of COVID-19 patients.

Short - essentially means sell
Long - means buy
Put - the right to sell a stock at a given price 
Call - the right to buy a stock at a given price
So if you are long call on a stock you have the right to buy that stock at a given price, ie if price goes up you win.
If you short a call position you have essentially sold to someone the right to buy the stock (from you), ie price goes up you lose. 
With all 4 positions you can gain/win either buy the actual cost of buying/selling the option contract itself OR by exercising the option and buying/selling the stock itself",,

It's an interesting situation for the developers of games though, they have to play catch up constantly, usually a little tweeking will suffice as Roblox devs make constant small reworkings, but not everyone can keep coming back every few days just to make sure their game works as intended, and it's even harder every couple months as medium sized ones happen. The trend is that these developers do actually spend years keeping their games up to date, but what's interesting is that games from 2005 and later where their creators quit, died, or something else, their games can be stolen and updated indefinitely, there almost nothing stopping someone from taking other peoples ""places"" as Roblox calls them, so popular games don't actually ever die, they just get made again and again by ambitious creators which there has never been a shortage of. 

I don't think their problem will actually be updating their platform, that is something they have historically been very anal about, and are still anal about making sure they roll out changes very frequently. Users' reaction from these updates hasn't ever had a high amount of backlash because the creators just keep updating their games so they don't really feel much until the major ones come out. The incentive for creators on Roblox is that they can trade an ingame currency for real money, which is another reason why they stay, and why there is very stiff competition to remain popular.",,

1) You only “save” on purchasing shares if your options expire in the money. If they don’t, your contracts expire worthless, and your loss is the amount you paid in options premiums. This could be in the thousands of dollars.

2) Building off that last sentence, options contracts deal in units of 100 shares. This means that any dollar amount you see in an options contract, you’re basically multiplying that number by 100. The dollar amount gets very large very quickly.

DO NOT trade options unless you fully understand how they work, and more importantly, have a good understanding of fundamental or technical analysis in which to base your judgement of the stock price (thus the direction in which the price will move).",,

If a lender hangs onto loans and doesn’t sell them that means they don’t conform to the Fannie/freddie standards so they are risky loans. You want to see loans get sold as MBSs that means they right safe loans. VA/FHA don’t buy loans they just gaurentee/insure/back loans in the event of foreclosure.

Attraction isn't a choice and you won't know until you start the interaction. You can't persuade or convince attraction. Once someone has decided that they're not attracted to you the fish is dead in the barrel.  

So as the party who approaches you're often rolling the dice on rejection when you initiate conversation/make conversation.

Based on the paramount responsibility of government to appear solvent (The fiat USD's trust comes from the citizens (public's) ability to pay it's debts (gov loans))... they can not raise rates. They can print more money to monetize new gov bond issuance... which is what they will likely do. Print enough to get inflation high enough where the increase in inflation is more than increase in gov borrowing, by so eventually stabilizing US Gov debt to GDP ratio back to 40% or so... which means 10-20% inflation for at least 10 years.",,
