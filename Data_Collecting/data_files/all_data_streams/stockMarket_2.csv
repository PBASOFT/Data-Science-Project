The next supply squeeze that may take markets by surprise isn‚Äôt lithium. It isn‚Äôt even a battery metal ‚Ä¶

While everyone is distracted by the media barrage surrounding EVs, another commodity may be creating an investment opportunity to rival all ‚Ä¶

We think it‚Äôs potentially bigger than the cannabis boom that reportedly netted some investors 1,000% gains.

It‚Äôs helium.

And some experts say we‚Äôre running out of it.

It‚Äôs not just a niche commodity anymore. It‚Äôs not just about balloons. And we think it‚Äôs positioned to become the focus of increased investor interest.  

Like oil and gas, this is about exploration, discovery, and development. And we think the biggest returns may end up coming from the small-cap explorers trying to hit the big time with a new discovery - all on their own.

*Growing Helium Demand*

Demand for helium is increasing, and it‚Äôs coming from multiple sectors, including everything from the tech and biomedical industries, to space, medical equipment and national security. And, yes, of course, party balloons and Thanksgiving Day parades.

Many industries require helium.

It‚Äôs been reported that the tech industry has been a massive catalyst, and that 2013 was a game-changing year for helium supply.

That‚Äôs when the world‚Äôs first ‚Äòhelium drives‚Äô were made commercially available, making helium a key ingredient to fill our monstrous appetite for data.

Some 3.7 billion people are generating some 2.5 quintillion bytes of data every single day. And even those numbers may grow by up to 60% a year. By 2025, it is projected to be more like 160 zettabytes per year. Helium drives were apparently a breakthrough that replaced the air in hard drives with helium to reduce the energy used. They went from concept to commercialization in 2013.

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)--all are said to need tons of it for their massive data centers.

We think demand is set to surge into the helium-driven territory of zettabytes.

And the growing semiconductor market may depend on helium, too. Why? Because helium can bring temperatures down to below -450 degrees Fahrenheit--lower even than liquid nitrogen. This is important for superconducting equipment in particle accelerators and the magnets used to build semiconductors, according to Forbes.

Driving this further is a global computer chip shortage.

In Geneva, Switzerland, the Large Haldron Collider (LHC), the largest high-energy particle accelerator on Earth--and the biggest machine in the world, needs a truckload of helium every week.

Nor does the demand story end there ‚Ä¶

The health sector is another major driver of helium demand. It‚Äôs also critical for use in cooling magnets in MRI machines. Without helium, we won‚Äôt have working MRIs. The shortage also threatens NMRs--nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which in turn is a crucial aspect of medical research.

As it approaches $100 trillion, you'll see a decrease in growth, a decrease in volatility, and it will creating a stable influence in the entire financial system of the 21st century,"" the CEO of MicroStrategy said in an interview earlier this year. 

I think this helps summarize the thinking. This investment group believes Bitcoin adoption will continue to grow up to 100x it's current size.

If you assume they are right about the adoption, then the rest makes sense. When Bitcoin adoption is 10X more than today, the market manipulators are not going to be able to destabilize the coin on a whim as they do now.

Most analysts have believed Bitcoin would reach at least a price of $100k since years ago. Recently it got to around $60k from around $10k last year. It's dropping this week, but anyone that takes this space seriously believes Bitcoin is going to grow a lot more before any real threat to its existence. So that means we are likely to see adoption of many more $trillion, and the price of $100k is still in the horizon and is a fairly sure bet if you do believe the adoption will expand.",,

Binance has lower fees but is illegal in the US and it's weirdly difficult to create an actual account on [Binance.US](https://Binance.US). 

Kraken has no easy way to transfer money onto the platform for some bizarre reason. Literally couldn't get my bank to wire them money. Feels scammy.

Gemini fees are ridiculously high unless you use a special version that's not available on mobile.

The stock market opened deep in the red but managed to climb throughout the session to pare much of the losses. For example, the Nasdaq (QQQ) opened 1.73% down but managed to close the day 0.12% up. Despite the market declining modestly the last three days, it is encouraging to see volatility decreasing this week  after the wild swings the market experienced in the last few weeks. As said before, I thought the initial sell-off after the April Consumer Price Index was released was overblown for several reasons and am encouraged by this week‚Äôs price action.  

Leadership in equity markets has see-sawed between cyclical and value stocks and technology stocks, as market participants weigh the prospects for a strong economic rebound as the US economy continues to reopen with the possibility that the pick-up in activity may generate a surge in inflation. After leading the market higher in April, in the last month, the Nasdaq is down 4.77% compared to 0.79% down in the S&P 500. In my view, this dip could represent a great opportunity given earnings have been extremely strong and many companies have significantly raised guidance moving forward. 

The Federal Reserve released its April Meeting Minutes (basically a written record of what happened in the meeting), which said that ‚Äúparticipants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee‚Äôs maximum-employment and price-stability goals‚Äù and reiterated, for like the millionth time, that they did not believe a near-term adjustment of monetary policy was needed. Much of the recent volatility in the market is due to investors afraid that a surge in inflation may cause the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy, so hopefully this commentary by the Fed can calm things down. [Read the entire meeting minutes here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210428.pdf)

However, it is important to note, the minutes covered the meeting before the release of the April Jobs Report, which came in much weaker than expected (which bolsters the Fed‚Äôs argument that employment remains far from their goal) and the Consumer Price Index, which showed a greater-than-expected increase in consumer prices. That said, the recent reports are extremely unlikely to change the Fed‚Äôs view given Powell and other monetary officials have said they expect any inflation to be ‚Äútransitory‚Äù and want to see a ‚Äústring‚Äù of strong labor reports before adjustments to the current policy are considered.

As the US economy reopens, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures ‚Äútransitory‚Äù. In an April 28 meeting, Jerome Powell said, ‚ÄúAmid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.‚Äù 

Moreover, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be ‚Äútransitory‚Äù as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a ‚Äústring‚Äù of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, ‚ÄúWe want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there‚Äôs a very large group of people who are not.‚Äù Finally, the April Job Report, which showed the economy gained only 266,000 jobs compared to the 1 million expected and marked a sharp deceleration in growth compared to March, bolsters Powell‚Äôs argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

**Highlights**

* After declining in recent weeks, the sell-off in cryptocurrencies across the board intensified, with Bitcoin (BTC) falling below $40,000 after the People Bank of China (PBOC) doubled down on it‚Äôs stance and released a statement reiterating that digital tokens shouldn‚Äôt be used for transactions. The PBOC posted in their official WeChat account, ‚ÄúVirtual currencies should not and cannot be used in the market because they‚Äôre not real currencies‚Äù. It‚Äôs important to note the statement doesn‚Äôt have any new regulatory steps, according to Yu Lingqu, a vice director at the China Development Institute think-tank in Shenzhen. 
* Ford Motor (F) is expected to unveil an all-electric version of its bestselling F-150 pickup truck tonight
* The US dollar dipped on Tuesday for the fifth straight session, reaching its lowest level against a basket of currencies since late February on waning fears that inflation spikes could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than anticipated, another great sign that inflationary fears are overblown. 
* Nvidia (NVDA) is extending its cryptocurrency mining limits to newly manufactured GeForce RTX 3080, RTX 3070, and RTX 3060 Ti graphics cards. After nerfing the hash rates of the RTX 3060 for its launch in February, Nvidia is now starting to label new cards with a ‚ÄúLite Hash Rate‚Äù or ‚ÄúLHR '' identifier to let potential customers know the cards will be restricted for mining. NVDA offers a separate, specialized mining processor that has the best performance for mining but will not be able to handle graphics. 
* In a Ford factory in Michigan, President Biden promoted his $174 billion plan to promote and accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles across the United States and planned to roll-back vehicle emission standards. According to the fact sheet, Biden's plan ""proposes cost-sharing grants to support new high capacity battery facilities in the United States‚Äù and backs grants to fund the retooling of shuttered factories ""to build advanced vehicles and parts.""
* Michael Burry, the investor famous for calling the 2008 housing market bubble and portrayed by Christian Bale in the movie ‚ÄúThe Big Short‚Äù, recently unveiled a huge bearish bet on Tesla. Scion Asset Management, Burry‚Äôs firm, said in a regulatory filing it had put options on 800,100 shares of Tesla, as of the end of Quarter 1, a value of $534 million. Details on the strike price of the puts, their value and whether they are part of a broader trade are not publicly available.
* Interestingly, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) has sold nearly all of its Wells Fargo (WFC) stock, a position the company has held since 1989. In a regulatory filing on Monday, Berkshire said it owned just $26.4 million of shares of WFC as of March 31, down from around $32 billion in January 2018.

* L Brands (LB) target raised by Barclays from $66 to $82 at Equal-Weight. Stock currently around $68

&#x200B;

Halfway through 2021, retail investing has reached a peak volume we have never seen before. In fact, the average amount of trades happening each day has more than doubled since 2019. Trillions of dollars are moved as stocks rise and fall throughout the day. However, even though stock prices change at all hours, US retail traders are restricted to the narrow timeframe of 9:30 AM through 4:00 PM EST.

The restrictive trading hours placed upon retail traders is just one of the many issues with the current system. Some of the other problems have been brought to attention due to recent events, such as the meteoric rise of GameStop stock and Dogecoin. In both cases, many different stock brokerages used by retail traders restricted the buying or selling of specific securities, effectively manipulating the market.

Time and time again we have seen larger investment institutions place rules and regulations on ordinary traders, while giving themselves the freedom to do whatever they want. Our goal? Level the playing field.

**Our vision**

The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) represents a massive amount of wealth and equity. It has a market cap of 26.2 trillion dollars and is easily the largest stock exchange on the planet. However, if you‚Äôre able to freely trade with all the stocks within the NYSE, you‚Äôre still only able to trade with roughly a third of the global stocks.

There are dozens of other stock exchanges out there using dozens of different currencies. However, the time-zone and currency differences make accessibility difficult. We see a world where anyone can trade on any stock exchange, regardless of their currency, at any time they wish. At first glance, it may seem idealistic, or a far reach. But in reality? It‚Äôs already here.

**What is StockSwap?**

StockSwap is the stock market reimagined, with the power of investing held equally by all parties for the first time in history.

On StockSwap, you can purchase any stock you want, just like on any other platform, but without any of the restrictions.

**How does it work?**

StockSwap is possible through the developments of cryptocurrencies and blockchains over the past several years. When you buy a stock on StockSwap, you are exchanging your money for a wrapped cryptocurrency token that is directly tied to and backed by your desired stock, purchased by us. This means you retain voting rights, receive dividends, and keep any other benefit of directly owning the stock yourself.

**How can I start?**

If everything you‚Äôve read so far sounded appealing, that‚Äôs fantastic. But while we‚Äôd like our platform to be perfect, we‚Äôre not quite there yet. Before you can start trading with us, there‚Äôs a few things you should know.

**Where are we now**

As we work towards perfecting StockSwap, all trades have a 1% fee placed on them, capping at $10 to help cover our developmental and maintenance costs. We understand nobody wants to pay money to invest and are working on further reducing those fees as we progress, with our ideal scenario consisting of phasing them out completely in the near future.

In addition, while StockSwap is already developed and fully functional, we are still finishing the process of obtaining our broker dealer license. Before completing this step, SEC regulations require the investment portfolio of any potential client to be greater than 10 million USD. This means, while we‚Äôre currently serving several dozen clients, it‚Äôll be at least a few more weeks before we‚Äôre able to able to help everybody trade freely.

Until then, keep up to date on our progress through our medium and telegram pages. We can‚Äôt wait for you to join us on our journey as we reimagine how we invest.

Until next time!",nghld2,StockSwap - Investing reimagined

And it's approved already, and it's added in Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for small cell lung cancer already and yes, it will be covered by insurance. 

So, the only reason that may explain such low current price is the global rebalancing to a value stocks. But without a doubt price will grow as soon as americans change their focus from coronavirus to other health problems. And probably it's a few months question.

Ah, I almost forgot... According to Webull average price target for $GTHX is 59$, between 41$ and 78$. And it's mostly based on actual price targets from the last three months. So, welcome aboard till it's undervalued.",nghpae,Why do Reddit users ignore such potential blockbuster stocks like $GTHX?

So the suggestion was this:  You should compare your returns to a broad-market index.  I'd ignore NASDAQ since that is tech-heavy and isn't really a good long-term comparison.   The S&P 500 is fine for large US companies.   The MSCI ACWI Index is another good all-world index too.   

Generally, if you're not beating these indexes consistently over time you might want to consider just buying an ETF or whatever your local equivalent is that tracks these indexes.   It's a lot less work and also results in a return which exactly matches the market the index tracks.",,

* Etsy had over 100% revenue growth in 2020 on their way to becoming the 4th largest marketplace by site visits.
* Over 88% of customers use the site to find products they can‚Äôt find anywhere else
* Over 40% of revenue is coming from outside of the US.
* Etsy estimates its TAM at $100B
* Less than 50% of customers are repeat annual buyers
* Etsy is trading at \~46x earnings
* Revenue grew at 141% yoy compared to Q1 of the prior year, but analysts are projecting revenue growth of 32% for the year 2021
* Etsy is expanding the service side of its business which includes higher margin revenue.

Etsy has a niche with its choice to target specialty goods, but I don‚Äôt know if this company has the stickiness and the growth to justify taking a position. Unlike e-commerce platforms like Shopify and BigCommerce, Etsy lacks the subscription revenue and app store that cements its ecosystem. Etsy is trying to salvage this through running onsite and off site ads. Even with this, what stops Etsy from becoming another eBay? Am I misunderstanding the business?

Bitcoin Originally was supposed to be a way to send and store money with no 3rd party help (No bank, No western union. nothing but you and the tech.) People started treating it like a store of value. Witch fine it's whatever. Bitcoin is kinda lame and more of a pioneering tech. 



But Then we get to ETH. Let's start with the basics of what you can do with ETH. I will try and make this all as basic as I possibly can. If any crypto people are here I'm sorry but I'm going to butcher the hell out of what it can actually do. 



If Bitcoin gets compared to gold. ETH can be compared to the bank. You can buy and store like Bitcoin but you can also create smart contacts to use as leverage against your ETH and do things like borrow money. You could treat the ETH coin like an option and bet on if it will go up or down. You can use ETH to Create NFT'S  Witch Isn't a really well explained concept but It a single token that you could Tie to anything. Phisical. You can Take NFTs and tie them to the sale of a car or your personal computer. It can act as a title to that item. You could use it to track Digital items in games. Nfts could solve the problems with owning something digitally. 



You can also create decentralized apps.So a blockchain is essentially one giant server split up and managed by computers all over the world. It's been neat watching the exchange of money work on the blockchain but what happens when We can start storing Data on the Blockchain. This is where Dapps come in. Imagine if you could have a version of YouTube Where you could upload a video that no one would be able to delete or block or censor. It would never go down you would never see the words YouTube servers are down. 



The word decentralized is thrown around a lot when it comes to crypto. But I want you to ask yourself something. 

If you had to have your personal info stored somewhere online. Who would you trust? I company like Palantir That runs on one set of servers. Or a blockchain? Where you are the only person involved with the storing of your data. You are in charge of who sees it. More importantly you're in charge of who gets access to your data. Imagine a world where your Data doesn't get hacked. Where you don't see news stories of corperations yet again losing your personal info to hackers. Thats what the blockchain is good for. I don't think you can look at tech thats been around for 10 years and call it a scam.",,

Do you guys have any good Funds or ETF that I could look into that have a value approach and could expose me to that kind of market. I've recently found the Brandes International Equity Fund and the BMO international Dividend ETF (ZDH). Where Brandes has a great value approach that I like they kind of lag vs the benchmark for that type of ETF. So I'm looking for a third option to compare and chose from one of the three.

Today, only the SPY gained a distribution day, but the number of stocks that hit their all-time high marks were well below the target minimum.

More adoption = less volatility


But it will take time, trust, and businesses are still a ways from having ' infrastructure ' ready, etc.. but with time we get more coins (ALL FUCKING COINS, EVEN ALTS). More coins = hopefully more wide spread holders and therefore even less volatility etc.


How I see it now especially considering everyone argues against alts because they 'can never beat bitcoin cuz MATH'; I agree and I say alts with lower USD equivalent caps have a better chance of being used often for currency because people will learn ""XYZ coin can never go above $xx.xx"".


Let's say that 'max' is $10.. if I need to buy groceries, I'll 1000000% use my coins that are at $6. can't go over $10 anyways so if it blows up tomorrow I'm not that upset. 


But we all know BTC (or a few others) are often theorized $100k+, 200k+.. that's great but I'm not gonna use a portion of my moonshot tickets for groceries when I have other 'less risky' things.

Luxurious feeling cars, top notch safety,  those alone justify any price discrepancy. But models for scaling production have them price competitive before 2025.

Fundamentally the company is strong. And from that foundation its statistically an unnecessary risk to short it.

It wont end well",,

I dont know what data you're seeing. But its Fud at best.

A company with 10 years of R&D, and patent head start. With  products so good they dont need to advertise them on television to be a household name.

That company, is going to be overtaken by older companies who have none of the R&D, and none of the patents. Are going to be able to either build new factories or retrofit existing production lines to manufacture entirely new and different machines. Because....... what? Old? Big? Money? Whats the advantage these legacy automakers have to let them catch up to a 10 year engineering head start tesla has let alone out pace them?

Its not the engineers. All the engineers specialized in EV production are at Tesla. And a career of building and improving piston engines isnt a background that translates to programming and software design. Most Mechanisms in ICE vehicles are coded into software in EVs by necessity. Theres no gear shift. No steering column, no air intake or exhaust.

Several big analysts think COIN might be a $400-500/share company in the next 12-18 months. It sucks it might take a year for you to recover your initial investment, but that's just the nature of it. Oppenheimer thinks it'll be \~$435/share within the next year or so, but also predicted a lot of volatility, too.

ARKX is an ETF that came out \~market high. The market overall has been down since then, especially with a lot of rotation out of the tech sector into value and consumer companies. Plus, Virgin had a pretty bad earnings, and Cathie removed them from ARKX.  Just look at the holdings. It's good companies.

I bought ARKG several years ago, and even with it being down this year, I'm still up a good deal with it. I dropped some of my IRA money into it at the start of the year, and I'm down like 30% on that. It feels bad, but I'm confidant it'll recover once people start rotating back into tech/cutting edge stuff.

So, ask yourself this....if you were to sell those investments now at a 40% loss, what would you put the money into NOW that would compensate for it?  Would you put it into something safe (VOO/VTI) where you can claw yourself out of the hole in 5 years or would you put it into something really risky to try to make up for it more quickly?

The customer market is also notoriously cheap. It‚Äôs fine to want to pay less for a product, but I would get laughable offers 50% below the going market on some items.

I still primarily sell there but I really dislike how customer centric they have become. I have shipped items that were legitimately lost in the mail because of covid and I was forced to refund the buyers. So I am out the inventory of the item because of a massive delay in shipping where it just gets stuck in a terminal.

Their search algorithm is also bunk. I have set prices to the lowest possible price and every now and then my items would not pop up in searches. I would have friends check with there accounts and they couldn‚Äôt find the item either.

With that said, I'd like to get peoples opinions on the pros and cons of each of these companies. 

What products do they offer?

How is one better than the other?

Will the function/price ratios of their product be cyclic or will there be a clear winner?

Just to bring up a few.

Here is some quick information on these companies:

**NVDA**: Company focuses on GPUs. Has a great GPU for both gaming and crypto. GPUs thrive in crypto and Neural Networks (AI).

MC\~350B, EV/EBITDA\~60, low debt, good growth

**AMD:** Has made a huge push in the CPU niche and has gained popularity with the gamers. Their CPUs are valued at the best function/price ratio. Pretty sure they are working on a promising GPU.

MC\~90B, EV/EBITDA\~40, low debt, good growth

**INTC:** The most experience and clout in the industry. Look around you, you'll probably see an intel sticker. Recent restructure of company with seems promising. Heavy in the DB and cloud niche which will be massive in the future (and currently is). Also, working on GPUs, not sure on the progress.

MC\~223, EV/EBITDA\~6.7, debt, could have less, good growth

At first glance the cheapest to most expensive from a valuation standpoint looks as followed INTC, AMD, NVDA, respectively.

UBS's holdings increased by 174% compared with the previous quarter, Goldman Sachs increased its holdings by 36% compared with the previous quarter, and Ali became the Chinese concept stock company with the largest holdings of Goldman Sachs. Most analysts on Wall Street believe that Ali‚Äôs firm investment in the new fiscal year will put pressure on short-term profit indicators, but the mid-to-long-term development trend is clear, which will help further strengthen the company‚Äôs long-term barriers to competition. At the same time, Ali said that it will disclose more indicators to measure the effectiveness of its investment in the e-commerce ecosystem from the next quarter. Higher transparency is expected to drive the market to regain confidence in the company's stock.

I get it, it's easy to disregard basic fundamentals  when you bought a dying meme stock at $22+ in January during the  GameStop short squeeze, and now you're suffering cognitive dissonance  from having to catch a falling knife in a delusional attempt to ""average  down"" on your FOMO induced speculative bet. Behavioural finance never  ceases to amaze me.   


BlackBerry has steadily shrunk since 2015.  They are a tech company that cannot compete effectively with industry  peers and get bullied out of most lines of business they venture into.  The company simply does not create value for shareholders. It is an  objectively poor investment of your money.

951,,2021-05-20 05:07:55,t3_ngrfdh,,StockMarket,"Profitability certainly isn't a one way road. If you ask pretty much any profitable trader on their journey, you'd be met by how much money they've  burnt for the sake of learning how to trade; and how you should place special emphasis on planning your positions. Conventional and generic as it may sound, trading the most liquid market on the field of investments actually needs a lot of attention to detail and groundwork.

With so, throughout my experience and journey in the forex market, here is my checklist before I enter a trade.

1. **KNOW YOUR BROKER.**  Yes, you've read that right. Knowing your broker can have a factor on your win rate. You have to know how much spread and leverage they offer--given so, it will help you determine whether your type of trading (Scalping, Swing, or Day Trading) would suit their services. For this, I use [Fazzaco.com](https://Fazzaco.com). They provide in-depth analyses on different FX Brokers. From trust ratings to news and economic datas , they have it all.
2. **KEEP TRACK OF YOUR TRADES.** Jot down your performance. Treat trading like a competitive online game. As much as possible, you would want to be one of the bests--having high win rates and a good stat sheet is one of our goals. To do that, you must be self-aware of your trading history. Trading is more than just making money. Part of it is also keeping records. I highly suggest using myforexbook
3. **CHECK THE FUNDAMENTALS.** Technical Analysis is one thing--personally, I use TA to find the best position to enter a trade. But other than that, my bias would entirely depend on the economic situation and datas the currency has to offer. Again, NEVER NEGLECT YOUR FUNDAMENTALS.
4. **TRUST YOUR ANALYSIS.** One of the many reasons why most traders fail is the tendency to switch bias while in a middle of a trade. Although some harbor success  on these methods, it isn't exactly for everyone. Stick to your plan. Remember, there are only two outcomes in trading. Either you win, or you lose. There is no middle ground.
5. **HAVE A GROWTH PLAN.** Think long-term. If you want to find success in the career of trading, set ideal objectives. It is essential to have daily, weekly, and monthly goals.

&#x200B;

Always remember that rules are what distinguishes viability from seasonality. A good trader is built step after step.  Hope you guys find this post useful.",ngrfdh,Hi guys! I've been trading for 2 years. Was lucky enough to achieve consistency within my first year. I just want to share some of the rules I've stuck by that has significantly affected my trading career.
