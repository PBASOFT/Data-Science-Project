If i choose to include 1 share, then when i try to set another stop limit order for, let's say $101, it will show 0 shares available to include now. Even if the first order has not been filled yet. If i change my mind and want to set the stop limit order for the higher price, then i can cancel the pending order if it has not been filled yet, and submit the new order.

My point is exactly what I said. You can't use crypto to buy very much of anything anywhere.

Crypto in its current state is a speculative investment vehicle. That is to say, people aren't buying Dogecoin or any of the other flavor of the week cryptocurrencies so they can then use it to buy groceries or pay their power bills.

4. Cheaper currency conversions with Fiat -> Crypto -> Fiat, due to higher liquidity & no overhead.
5. Predictable inflation.
6. With cold storage - nobody knows if I have $5 or $5m. And if you memorize 32 words - your money cannot be ceased (assuming no torture).
7. For retailers - fewer fees than 3% of Visa & Mastercard. No chargebacks.
8. Retailers can accept customers from any country. No sanctions or blacklists.
9. No identification or proofs (location/age/etc) to have a wallet. And implications of that, like the possibility of a wallet controlled by software.
10. Insurance with smart contracts. For example - if the flight is delayed based on 3 sources - automatically issue $50 for each hour. Or if the temperature drops to -10F in Houston - issue $10,000. And since no 3rd party with offices & people involved - it’s cheaper & instant.

Yeah, and that's why I didn't do that. I specifically quoted you to avoid that. You said ""you can't use Bitcoin to buy much of anything anywhere, therefore it is not a currency"". That is incorrect. If that WERE the way the world decided what is/isn't a currency--it's not, by the way--then by your very own standard the kwanza, the cook islands dollar, and many, MANY more ""aren't real currency"" because I can buy more with Bitcoin in NYC then I can with kwanza anywhere in the world. Again, that's NOT how we define a currency, so you're literally just throwing shit at a wall to see what sticks.



>Crypto in its current state is a speculative investment vehicle. That is to say, people aren't buying Dogecoin or any of the other flavor of the week cryptocurrencies so they can then use it to buy groceries or pay their power bills. They're buying in hopes that its value will increase relative to their own standard currency so they can sell it later for profit... and then use THAT money to buy groceries and pay their power bills.



And people's speculation have nothing to do with what is is. They can eat the Bitcoin, shit on it, throw it off a highway, it doesn't matter and what other people are doing with their dollarydoos, euros, or Bitcoin isn't really relevant. Like at all.

>Why would anyone give two shits about that?

I think he means to say that it's more of a ""fixed""quantity of Bitcoin. I think it's very unlikely to happen but there's always the possibility of the next politicians to be even more printing money friendly. The dollar is very stable, but one thing you can't deny is that it can be printed out of thin air by the treasury/legislation based on whoever is in power in the US. Crypto is a ""global"" currency/asset. 


>I mean, you will also know the rate at which the US dollar will inflate

Goes back to the point above. 


>PayPal? God forbid I defend PayPal, but they're faster and cheaper than sending BTC. And that's saying something

Tell that to the people who've been locked out of their money for no reason and have had to fight tooth and nail because PayPal isn't regulated as banks are. At their sole discretion, they can choose to fuck you over. You can legally fight back but not without paying lots of money. In the US, sending money between people in banks takes a few days unless you pay to ""wire"" money. Zelle is starting to take over but they have limits between 500. 2000 per day AND it's tracked by your bank. Some would argue that the bank or government doesn't need to know how much/how often or to whom you exchange money with. We've kind of accepted that already but just stating something not obvious. 


>My US dollars are pretty secure in a standard bank account...

Sure. I don't think this is such a great point against the dollar. BUT you should realize that everyday people don't have the luxury of having multiple thousands of dollars in their bank and are charged fees by large banks to maintain their accounts. $12 a month for someone who has less than $500 in their bank account seems kind of a lot. Again, people have accepted this as normal and there's ways to not pay a fee but you can't argue that the freedom of crypto might be something that people want. 

At the end of the day, I don't think there's any crypto out there AT THIS MOMENT that beats the dollar in terms of stability/security etc. But if I had to bet against crypto being the future in 10 or 100 years, I wouldn't do it.",,

There's a transparency in Ark funds that breaks norms in a way that is \*mostly\* beneficial to investors. She runs a bunch of hyper growth funds and you're absolutely right that hyper growth isn't going to outperform every year. She believes over a 5 year time horizon, her basket of hyper growth is likely to double in value, or I guess now it's 125% of value. I agree that's silly. But as an investor, you can see what the funds you own are actually doing on a daily basis and decide if it remains something you want to own.

Taking Cathie out of the equation, her ETF's are baskets of stocks that you can make a decision if you want to own or not. I find the cult of personality silly. It was silly when people were calling her money tree at the peak and it's equally silly saying she's a fraud because her funds are down 30% from their high after a 150% 1Y return. It's never been a large allocation for me, but I continue to watch the daily trades, know what are in the funds, and own it for that reason. For example, can you say you disagree with the 5-year prospects of most of [ARKF's top 10 holdings](https://ark-funds.com/fintech-etf)?

As much as crypto's have gained mainstream acceptance as a speculative investment, their use as a medium of exchange is going to stay niche unless some monumental hurdles are overcome.

All the time now, a company performs well and the stock price drops because of it. Take Lowe's last week for example. It literally doubled earnings, 8x in a row it's destroyed them, and It's down 9% since. What more could you literally want from a company (I dont own it btw, so this isn't a rant on that basis)

I know the argument is ""ThE WhoLE MaRkEt Is DoWn"". Sorry, no, I don't buy this bullshit.

Let's look at todays winners;

America Great Health is the 5th biggest gainer today, up 15%. It's a garbage fucking pennystock that trades at 0.18 cents. Even worse, it's a bullshit pharma stock that used to be a fucking marketing company. Normal volume is 10 million. Volume today - 200 million. There is no news to justify this interest

Iovance Biotherapeutics, another fucking pharma stock, missed earnings, has CLAIMS OF SECURITIES FRAUD, and is up 15% today.

LifeMD has had 2 lawsuits filed against it in the last week, about claims its directors have committed (even more) fraud -- seems like a pattern. Even better;

LifeMD appears to use unlicensed doctors to dispense OTC medications, has implemented an autoshipping/autobilling scheme, failed to honor guarantees, and put in place abusive telemarketing practices.

So what does the stock do in response to this? Of course, it jumps 15%.

To end my rant, the 3rd placed highest today is another bullshit company, a Chinese medical company called Lianluo Smart. There's one single news article linking it to a takeover by newegg or something, the news article made little sense. Low and behold, normal volume is 400k, today it's 9 million. Even if the news is to be believed, this one single article was posted 1 hour ago, yet the price suddenly spiked 2 hours ago.

So, why do companies that do well, make money, smash earnings lose their stock value, and bullshit, nonsense companies get P&D so much. This is a daily occurence. Every single day I see a new company increasing its share price by 50%+ and it's nonsense. I thought P&D's were illegal.

The value of USD over a time horizon of 100 years has declined 99%, so it'd be fair to assume it will decline another 99% in the coming 100 years if it survives that long. Clearly fiat is not good to hold long-term. Many people buy stocks. Individual stocks as well as index funds are in massive bubbles by every measure, because people mindlessly throw money in without any regard to the underlying value of the companies.

There is a use case for a thing called a ""savings account"" which used to be a thing that yielded interest that would offset the deterioration of fiat value over time. Central banks around the globe have killed the notion of savings accounts due to ""easy money"" & ""infinite debt"" policies, quantitative easing. Over the past century, gold has been seen as an inflation hedge or an alternative form of a long-term savings account. 

Bitcoin by its programmatic definition is better than fiat cash, gold, and savings accounts at preserving value, even if the user-base stagnates, but bitcoin also has the upside potential of new adoption as people grow to trust it and see it as a new and improved form of a long-term savings account.",,

That only really works out if the issuance of new ETH is less than the fee burn, but issuance is going to drop dramatically as well due to the transition to proof-of-stake.

Fees represent real-world value paid by users in accordance with the value they place on getting their transaction through, so imho all this actually does establish intrinsic value for ETH.

Hi, I'm 22 and from the UK, I like the idea of new markets and choosing my plan, I contribute 21% of my salary to pension (employer pays 15%)
  
My default pension plan would be 100% Global Equity Fund, but I would like some more diversification. For example, that fund only has a 0.2% exposure to emerging markets.
  
I was considering:
  
80% Global Equity Fund (TER 0.17%)
  
5% NA Equity Fund (TER 0.05%)
  
5% Global Emerging Markets (TER 0.70%)
  
4% Asia Pacific (Excluding Japan) (TER 0.05%)
  
2.5% Europe Excluding UK (TER 0.05%)
  
2.5% UK (TER 0.04%)
  
1% Japan (TER 0.04%).
  
The Asia Pacific fund only has a 0.1% exposure to China, so the GE does a good job at including that and also the regions like South America and Central, which are not given as Equity Funds to choose from.
  
I'm completely okay and aware that the GEM may well fail for awhile and not take off, but do we think 5% is a reasonable amount to risk?
  
I do plan to monitor geopolitical activity, and I will also be moving some of the % into ESGs (Environmental Social and Goverance) Funds, probably changing 80% GE to 70% GE and then 10% ESG when it becomes available for me.
  
Overall, I'd just like some opinions - I'm trying not to go risk crazy, hence the 80% which is a GE, is this a reasonable level for someone new to investing?

The issue is that monetary control has huge implications globally. Maybe it doesn't affect you much in your first-world life (unless you happen to be carrying nontrivial cash and [a cop pulls you over in the US and decides to take it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_forfeiture_in_the_United_States)) but if you take Venezuela going from relatively wealthy nation to destitute poverty due to monetary controls from its government, China's capital controls not only affecting its people but distorting markets worldwide like London and Vancouver as Chinese citizens try to get money out, Argentina (historically and seemingly again now) and countless others, I do think tools to decrease monetary power of such governments will become more useful. TBC, I don't think Bitcoin or Ethereum are those tools today. They are in use in Venezuela and such, but at least to the degree we can measure them, not to a degree that really has any meaningful impact.

Then there's the whole world of remittances: Western Union, Moneygram, and others like them charge obscene rates to send money worldwide, often to poor immigrants sending meager earnings back to their families. Again, not saying Bitcoin or Ethereum or anything else here is solving them, but I don't think the status quo is good, and I don't think a ""regulated cryptocurrency"" will solve it either, and I do think something _like_ Bitcoin _could_ help with problems like that.

Yes, the volatility is insane, the energy problems are real, and to an outsider it looks like a giant pyramid scheme. But at the same time, we've never actually bootstrapped a currency from nothing, with no government/force backing it, and I'm not really sure whether it's even possible. But if I play out hypothetical scenarios of what it might look like, it seems like it would look an awful lot like what we're seeing, with crazy volatility, accusations of pyramid scheme peddlers, and all the usual, and maybe someday stability if enough people believe in it.

tl;dr: I'm not necessarily sold on the current offerings, but I don't think ""regulated crpytocurrencies"" will be the future either, and I think there's a lot of shitty outcomes out there due to today's money that can actually be improved upon",,

>Welcome to the digital world, where everything can be bought 24/7 without leaving your house.

Not true - You can only buy/sell stocks during ""market hours"", which is 8 hours a day and doesn't include weekends or holidays. You could only buy/sell physical gold when your local gold dealer is open.  


>\-You can divide it.  
>

I think this is meant to be contrary to gold, which you'd have to melt down to the exact amount if you want to buy a car with it.  


>\-You know exactly how much of it exists in the world  
>  
>Why would anyone give two shits about that?

Money supply is VERY important. Do you care about the slave trade? In west Africa, the currency was glass beads. Europeans realized they could manufacture glass beads cheaply and bring them over by the boatload to go shopping. This left Africa with a lot of glass beads and Europe with all of their goods and possessions. When they were so impoverished, the logical next step was to buy the people themselves.  


>\- and the rate at which that will increase.  
>  
>I mean, you will also know the rate at which the US dollar will inflate

You don't, though. Before last year, nobody expected the Federal Reserve to double the money supply.

&#x200B;

>\- You can transfer it over the internet.  
>  
>PayPal? God forbid I defend PayPal, but they're faster and cheaper than sending BTC. And that's saying something

Paypal is not useful in many countries, especially places with high unbanked populations. It is also censored many places where it is needed most - Venezuela and Palestine for example. I send Bitcoin to unbanked family overseas far cheaper than any bank or remittance service can (due to exchanges batching transactions, my network fee is usually \~$1), and they can exchange it for local currency faster and cheaper than any other method.  


>\- You can secure it in sophisticated ways at a low cost compared to other things.  
>  
>My US dollars are pretty secure in a standard bank account...

US Dollars have lost 99% of purchasing power over the past 100 years, and over that period of time, there have been numerous ""bank runs"" where customers try to withdraw their funds and the banks can't fulfill it. It's unlikely, but the time this would happen is when you need it most.  


>None of what you said is attractive about changing your whole lifestyle just to go edgy and incorporate the use of Bitcoin as a CURRENCY in your life.  
>  
>Guess why? Because it's not, and never will be, used as a currency by anyone. Too many hurdles

I don't use it as a currency, and wouldn't advise anyone to - other than for large international transactions. It's interesting to see the government refer to them as ""cryptoassets"" here. I think it's more likely that some central banks will need to prop up their fiat currencies by backing them with Bitcoin. Furthermore, Bitcoin is likely to replace the USD as the global reserve currency, because it doesn't give the economic advantage of ""reserve"" status to a single nation, and it also makes more sense globally than the petrodollar.",,

You can open a bank account, use mobile apps, and grow your wealth in investing in real estate and stocks.

Most of the world do not have these privileges. 42% of the world, 4.2 billion people, live under authoritarian regimes. Their currency are often debased and cutoff from the financial system that you enjoy.

The fact that you can protect and grow your wealth by investing in stocks, bonds, and real estate is a privilege most of the world do not enjoy. The fact that you can save for retirement without worrying about it devaluing 90% overnight is a privilege.

Bitcoin provides an escape hatch.

For activists living under state repression, bitcoin provides a way to preserve their money in cyberspace, locked away by encryption.

In Iran and Palestine and Cuba, individuals face sanctions or embargoes because of the misdeeds of their corrupt rulers. Bitcoin gives them a lifeline for earning income or receiving remittances from abroad.

You don't need to have a particular passport or bank card or voting status to use it. No government can turn off your bitcoin if it's threatened by your ideas.

Bitcoin provides an alternative to our increasingly centralized financial system. It gives any activist or journalist a way to raise funds without censorship, a way to save despite the corrosive impact of excessive money printing.

That will likely continue for the foreseeable future, as each blockchain has its own specific wallet requirements. The place that many of these will differ will be between exchanges and private wallets. If you send crypto from an exchange that has KYC to a wallet that you own it should be easy to ID as you say due to the fact that you likely will be sending many transactions to that same wallet. You can also send coins to another exchange that you have accounts on. That may be easy or not to find depending on where in the world that exchange is located and how opaque their accounting system is. If you then exchanged one coin on one chain/wallet for another coin on another chain/wallet system and put the resulting coin into yet another privately held wallet, it can get really Byzantine really fast.

Is my theory correct, that since a lot of money is in the hands of rich people which store it in all sorts of assets (housing, stocks, bonds, etc.) the little percentage of money that is available to the rest won't have such a big impact that it will cause a too big of a change in inflation?",nhgs6x,Possibility of not having too high inflation in the US due to high M2

Message begins:

This makes lots of sense, however, let’s say I trade one crypto for another? That should be a taxable event as well, it’s just that, for now, the onus is on the owner of that crypto to share that info with the govt.  and pay the tax. Some exchanges operate with KYC and some do not. If a person was to choose to trade currencies on an unlisted exchange and then sell those on a KYC exchange, how do they determine basis? Is the basis the initial price that they paid for the original coin? The exchange rate of the coins? There is a lot of space where gains could be concealed and transfers not reported. Admittedly this is part of the reason BTC was created: to allow anyone to transfer wealth to anyone else without the intermediary of a banking system needing to get involved. That also means that there are loads of ways to move funds that would require a lot of investigation to uncover where and how much was transferred. All of this is not to mention certain coins that are designed, from the outset, to be completely anonymous, and therefore opaque to anyone tracing transactions. 

Herein lies the difficulty that governments are going to encounter when attempting to enforce these tax laws. I think the best case scenario would be for crypto currencies to work with governments to make taxation easier and more transparent. That may be a serious long shot for some of them. Less so for others. I think that Some are attempting to work with several governments to gain legitimacy for their crypto system. They seems to think that proper regulation and government compliance will be key to more universal adoption. This will remain to be seen.",,

I also read something recently that makes a lot of sense. Over any 20 year period in the Russell 3000 index something like 64% of all companies would be losing investments. Only 15% of the companies in the same index account for 95% of all the index gains.

Most crypto systems are designed to be open and transparent, such that everyone sees every transaction and the hash that signed it. Thus, everyone has access to who owns what and when they transfer it. The issue is that wallet IDs can be difficult to trace even in these conditions as many blockchain screwy unique new addresses for each transaction. It still points to the same wallet if you decrypt it, but many systems may lack the sophistication to apply that math.

That delay is because the banks want to make sure one account holder has the funds for the other account. Some people might have enough reputation to have the banks trust them and move money faster but essential the delay is to confirm ownership.

With the block chain that ownership was public and verified by millions of other people. So if people want to move large sums of money around the delay to verify ownership doesn't take that long.

Now expand that to ALL things and not just money, you can verify ownership of anything. If you have the key that says you own something then you are the owner.

Billionaire investor Sam Zell is seeing inflation everywhere, and has bought gold as a hedge -- something he says he used to knock others for doing.

“Obviously one of the natural reactions is to buy gold,” he said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “It feels very funny because I’ve spent my career talking about why would you want to own gold? It has no income, it costs to store. And yet, when you see the debasement of the currency, you say, what am I going to hold on to?”

Zell, 79, said he’s concerned not only about the U.S. dollar but other countries printing money as well, and questioned whether inflation will be transitory, as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated last week.

“Oh boy, we’re seeing it all over the place,” Zell said of inflation. “You read about lumber prices, but we’re seeing it in all of our businesses. The obvious bottlenecks in the supply chain arena are pushing up prices. It’s very reminiscent of the ‘70s.”

While gold is an attractive investment, opportunities in fossil fuels are not, said Zell, who in 2019 agreed to set up a joint venture with Tom Barrack Jr.’s Colony Capital Inc. to invest in oil and gas.

“Right now, oil and gas is not priced to reflect the risk of what’s going on, whether it be in the EV world, a climate changed world,” he said. “As recently as a couple of years ago I thought the risk-reward ratio was appropriate. It’s clearly become very inappropriate as our political situation has changed.”

Zell also said he’s concerned about renewable energy undermining the reliability of power grids, pointing to the recent blackouts in California and Texas.

In real estate, there are plenty of questions about what demand will look like over the next couple years in the office, lodging and retail sectors, Zell also said in the interview.

“Everybody’s worried about going back to work and office-space occupancy. I don’t think that’s really an issue,” he said. “The problem is that, before the pandemic, we were dealing with an oversupply of office space. Obviously the pandemic hasn’t reduced that oversupply and has probably encouraged it accordingly.”

Stores also present challenges, he said, given that the U.S. already had more retail space per person than the rest of the world before Covid-19, and shoppers increased their reliance on e-commerce while stuck at home during the pandemic.

“Street retail today is like a falling knife, and you don’t know how far it goes down,” he said. While that “doesn’t mean the best malls aren’t going to perform,” there’s a “huge amount of real estate that’s going to have to be reprogrammed in one form or another.”

The challenges faced by hotels are more of a temporary problem over the next three to four years, Zell said. “We will see a slow recovery in business travel,” he said. “In the interim period of time, it’s going to be a slow recovery, and hotels are big overhead things and running them at less-than-optimum occupancy is a very expensive scenario.”",nadzhy,Billionaire Sam Zell Buys Gold With Inflation ‘Reminiscent of the ‘70s’

[amazon.com](https://amazon.com) seems to be hot last year because people don't want to go to stores to buy stuff but once the store opens, wouldn't the traffic of [amazon.com](https://amazon.com) go down? Also, since people are at home more, AWS was getting a lot more traffic from their popular clients such as Netflix. But once the economy reopens, people won't stay at home as much and therefore not go on to AWS-hosted websites as much, right? Other services such as Twitch and Amazon Prime should have lower traffic too because of people spending less time at homes. The only few services I think of might benefit are Whole Foods and IMDb.com.

But somehow, analysts seem very bullish on Amazon's short-term. I am seeing a bunch of $4000-$5000 price targets. Why are analysts giving such high price targets when so much of Amazon's revenue depends on the environment of staying at home?

Thanks for sharing your thoughts!",nhixq1,How will reopening affect Amazon?

&nbsp;

**Quick summary**

-   She has a long history of running funds that fit under ""discovery growth"" or ""global thematic"" styles.

-   Cathie has a **great track record outperforming the S&P 500**, but much of this has been due to outperformance of growth style. Also, this assumes you catch the very early cycles of her outperformance.

-   When compared to category style, almost all of Cathie's major **outperforming** years come during special periods in the market cycle, particularly in the periods following a market crash. With one other period of great performance during the 2017 BTC bubble craze**.**

-   Outside of those special events, Cathie's funds generally **underperform** equivalent style peers on a year-by-year basis.

-   She has a history of **leaving a fund during or** **following a period of underperformance**, then ""rebooting"" in another fund. This includes a short stint in **a hedge fund that lost over 80% of it's AUM**.

&nbsp;

Before getting into the deep dive, a quick note on benchmarks. Cathie's investment style fits into one of two flavors: **US growth** and **global growth**. The S&P 500 is not an appropriate benchmark at all for a growth-oriented or global oriented fund. Instead, for the years available, I will benchmark her to the Russell 1000 Growth and MSCI World Large Cap Index, as these fit her investment universe and demonstrate whether an investor would have been better off with a passive index fund.

Additionally, I'm going to compare her performance to some matching T Rowe Price Funds. Why T Rowe Price? First, their security selection universe is similar to Cathie Woods: they tend to prefer growth-oriented companies (i.e. think Amazon rather than Phillip Morris). Secondary, they have been around for a while and their funds have history dating back earlier than the indices I will be using.

Finally, for another reference point I will benchmark against Yahoo Finance's category averages for years where no index data is easily available. 

&nbsp;

In Summary:

-   To benchmark her ""discovery growth"" funds, I am going to use the **i-shares Russell 1000 Growth Index (IWF)** (subject to years available) as well as **T Rowe Price's New Horizon Fund (PRNHX).**

-   To benchmark her ""global "" fund, I am going to use **Vanguard Total World (VT)** (subject to years available) and **T Rowe Price's Global Stock Fund (PRGSX)**.

-   For years where no index data is easily available, I will instead use Yahoo Finance's category averages (average of of active fund performance, after fees).

&nbsp;

**1980-1998 (Jennison Associates)**

This is the one period for which I could not find any performance data, as there are only a handful of surviving funds from that period. She was apparently a portfolio manager and chief economist. I tried looking up fund history on the SEC website but could not find anywhere she is listed as a manager, even after searching shareholder reports for the period. It's possible whichever funds she worked on are no longer around...so unfortunately we need to skip this period.

&nbsp;

**1998-2001 (Tupelo Capital Services)**

Cathie co-founded this hedge fund in 1998..right as the dotcom bubble was building steam. ARK's company profile boasts that she managed $800 million in assets in 2000. Interesting that they give this figure for the very height of the market bubble. In 2001, as the market bubble crashes, Cathie leaves Tupelo Capital.

Unfortunately there is no accurate performance history for this hedge fund, but I have found AUM filings from the SEC.

In Q4 1999, the fund's AUM reached $1.0 billion.

Source (<https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-00-001292/>)

In Q1 2000, the fund's AUM then reached $1.3 billion.

Source (<https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-00-005389/>)

By Q4 2000, the AUM shrank to ~$800 million: matching Cathie's stated figures.

Source (<https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-01-001535/>)

Finally, by the end of Q1 2001, the AUM shrank to ~$200 million.

Source (<https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-01-502496/>)

In other words**, the fund's AUM shrank roughly 80% over 2000 and 2001**. Note that this would have been due to a combination of asset losses as well as investors pulling out, so it's not possible to know how much of that is due to actual equity losses.

By comparison, T Rowe's Global Equity Fund lost 17% across 2000-2001, roughly in line with the category average. Unfortunately Vanguard's Total World index (VT) did not exist during this timeframe.

&nbsp;

**2001-2013 (Alliance Bernstein)**

After Cathie left Tupelo Capital Services, she joined Alliance Bernstein. During her tenure she managed three funds that I could find:

-   AB Discovery Growth (**CHCIX**): A discovery/growth oriented fund.

-   AB Sustainable Global Thematic Fund (**ALTFX**)

-   AB Strategy Research Portfolio: Note that this is a Separately Managed Account (SMA) not an open mutual fund. I will use the acronym **ABSRP**.

All further sources will be at the bottom.

**2014-2020: Ark Years**

For the Ark era, I am going to use ARKK to evaluate her performance. I'm using ARKK because first and foremost it is her flagship fund, and secondly because her specialty funds, while interesting, are nearly impossible to benchmark against. For another comparison, I am also going to add another passive fund to the mix, Vanguard's VGT (Technology Index), in addition to the Russell 1000 Growth.

&nbsp;

**2014: N/A**

There is no full-year history for ARKK in 2014.

&nbsp;

**2015: Cathie UNDERPERFORMS T Rowe, UNDERPERFORMS Passive**

Benchmarks I am using for ARKK are IWF (IShares Russell Growth 2000) and VGT (Vanguard Technology ETF) as a secondary benchmark. It turns out to not make a difference whether a year is a underperform or an outperform. 

-   **ARKK**: 3.76%

-   VGT: 5.02%

-   IWF: 5.50%

-   PRNHX: 4.50%

&nbsp;

**2016: Cathie UNDERPERFORMS T Rowe, UNDERPERFORMS Passive**

-   **ARKK**: 87.38%

-   VGT: 37.07%

-   IWF: 29.96%

-   PRNHX: 31.49%

Summary: This is without a doubt the breakout year for Cathie Wood. How was this done? Can you guess what was the biggest contributor to her outperformance? Hint - it wasn't an equity holding. A position in Bitcoin Investment Trust is by far her top contributor, netting her 635, 748, 655 basis points of compounding outperformance in Q2, Q3, and Q4. Check out their quarterly reports and you'll see it's not even close. Note that the contribution of this is more than simply the compounding of 1.0635 * 1.0748 * 1.065..because this compounding is based upon the base of all assets. In other words..I estimate her actual returns without bitcoin would have been about 57%. Still great, but brings it down a bit more towards earth.

Q1 Return: 19.2%

Q2 Return 20.9% (14.55 without BTC)

Q3 Return 18.3% (10.82 without BTC)

Q4 Estimated Return 9.9% (3.35 without BTC)

**56.3% return without BTC (estimated)**

**87.4% return with BTC included.**

2020 bears no explanation. We all lived through the fun in the market last year. In case it isn't obvious, her biggest contributor for the year was Tesla, however there were many others as well and overall it was a much more balanced return profile versus that of 2017.

&nbsp;

**My take on ARK**

The following comes directly from ARK's own FAQ:\
""ARK's funds are fully invested and do not hold a material amount of cash. ARK generally will not use cash in a tactical manner.""

<https://ark-funds.com/help-center/what-is-the-typical-range-for-the-cash-position>

Let me explain in layman speak what this means. Here the algorithm Cathie follows to buy or sell:

-   When Cathie receives inflows, she buys

-   When Cathie receives outflows, she sells

Sounds a lot like the algorithm for a passive fund. You see, unlike most active funds...Cathie is not tactically using cash nor thinking of limiting inflows..even as she now sits with many billion AUM, and continuing to pump money into existing positions.

Unlike Cathie, **top active shops tend to hold higher cash positions during times of market euphoria and close funds when they are performing** ***too*** **well**. The exception to this are mega-cap blue chip funds, but Cathie is not running a mega-cap blue chip fund. The T Rowe Funds in my benchmarks for example are currently either closed or restricted to new inflows. Fidelity has done the same with very successful small or mid-cap funds. Let me quickly summarize what IMO are some of the best virtues of a good active manager:

-   Keep cash onhand and deploy it only when there is a reasonable risk/reward tradeoff.

-   Sell if the risk/reward tradeoff is no longer to the best interest of your clients, even if this means selling to a cash position.

-   If your cash grows too large or if your fund performs too well..you should consider closing the fund as otherwise it attracts short-minded performance chasers.

-   If there is a great buying opportunity (i.e. a market crash) and your fund is closed, you should open your fund to solicit new inflows.

-   You should try to keep your Assets Under Management (AUM) small if possible. The larger your AUM, the more difficult it is to make a winning bet on a small cap. Let's say for example you wanted to bet 5% of your portfolio on San Jose Water Company (SJW), an infrastructure holding of mine. Well...their total market cap is less then $2 billion. If your AUM was $100 billion, you'd need to buy the entire company outright just to make a small dent in the portfolio.

-   Your marketing to your clients should be reasonable and not overpromise. Telling your clients ""your goal is to beat the S&P 500 on a risk adjusted basis"" is fine as long as you are clear about risks involved.

I do not see Cathie following any of the above. Instead I am seeing a combination of dangerous behaviors:

-   Actively soliciting more inflows even when total AUM across Ark funds exceeded $50 billion. This is forcing more purchases into existing overcrowded positions.

-   Advertising that ARKK should double your investment in 5 years.

-   Regularly putting out videos, promotional materials, interviews, etc. promoting the house holdings with price targets significantly above most industry targets.

I do not believe Cathie is acting in her investors best interests. Intentionally or not, I believe Ark is essentially a pump scheme:

-   Buy companies with a marketable story and small revenue base but large revenue growth.

-   Promote the companies heavily: sell investors on the story.

-   Solicit inflows, use to buy more into those positions...sometimes owning up to 10% of the company. My theory is that this in itself is jacking up the price of those companies...

-   Sit back and **watch the stock's price grow at a faster rate than revenue growth**. This is not sustainable.

-   Until...well until what? You now hold a basket of companies trading at very high P/S ratios. Some of them might become the next Google, but surely they all won't become the next Google. You can try selling them to some greater fool, but good luck doing that with 10s of billions in AUM.

&nbsp;

Edit: lots of posts about how ARK cannot control inflows because it's an ETF. This is true and not Cathie's fault, but nonetheless it's a problem...or at least it's fair to say it's a flaw in the structure of active or concentrated ETFs. ARK is now suffering from the big AUM problem. Too much capital to chase after too few opportunities, victim of its own success.

* “I can’t find any period in history where monetary and fiscal policy were this out of step with the economic circumstances, not one,” the chair and CEO of Duquesne Family Office said.
* Though he agreed with the early steps the Fed took during the pandemic, he said the policies have continued for too long.

Federal Reserve policies aimed at keeping markets and the economy afloat during the pandemic could end up threatening the long-term health of the U.S. dollar, investing magnate Stanley Druckenmiller told CNBC on Tuesday.

The chairman and CEO of Duquesne Family Office said the Fed’s insistence on holding interest rates down and buying trillions in bonds even though markets are thriving and the economy is booming is a long-term risk.

“I can’t find any period in history where monetary and fiscal policy were this out of step with the economic circumstances, not one,” Druckenmiller said during a”Squawk Box” interview.

Though he does not take issue with the Fed’s initial actions to combat the pandemic-related threats, Druckenmiller said the central bank has kept its foot on the accelerator too long.

He asserted that the Fed has continued its policies to help underwrite the spending binge in Congress, which has allocated more than $5 trillion in stimulus and is contemplating trillions more in infrastructure-related spending.

Over the long haul, he said, the policies and the heavy debts and deficits they support will threaten the dollar’s standing as the world’s reserve currency. That status means the dollar is accepted for transactions and as a store of wealth anywhere and is widely held by central banks around the world.

“If they want to do all this and risk our reserve currency status, risk an asset bubble blowing up, so be it. But I think we ought to at least have a conversation about it,” Druckenmiller said.

“If we’re going to monetize our debt and we’re going to enable more and more of this spending, that’s why I’m worried now for the first time that within 15 years we lose reserve currency status and of course all the unbelievable benefits that have accrued with it,” he added.

To be sure, others have warned in the past that Fed excesses could threaten the dollar, but the greenback has retained its position in the world.

One reason for that is there have been no other viable alternatives introduced.

Druckemiller has entertained the thought that a challenge could come from the crypto world. He said in the CNBC interview that the ultimate solution could be “some kind of ledger system invented by some kids from MIT or Stanford” though he conceded that “I don’t know what it will be.”

However, he noted that in the early days of the pandemic, other foreign governments already voiced their concerns about the dollar by selling Treasurys, the opposite of what normally would happen in a crisis when ultra-safe U.S. debt is generally seen as a haven.

Indeed, foreign holdings of government bills, notes and bonds actually have decreased, falling by $127 billion or nearly 2% over the past year, according to Treasury Department data. Foreigners hold nearly one-third of the public portion of the $28.2 trillion U.S. debt.

Druckenmiller said central banks have been the root of a lack of confidence in dollar stability.

“The problem has been clearly identified. It’s [Fed Chair[ Jerome Powell and the rest of the world’s central bankers,” he said. “There’s a lack of trust.”

Druckenmiller’s comments came a day after he and Duquesne partner Christian Broda said in an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal that Powell “needs to recognize the likelihood of future political pressures on the Fed and stop enabling financial and market excesses.”

Similarly, former New York Fed President William Dudley wrote in Bloomberg News that markets are underestimating how much the central bank will have to raise interest rates in the years ahead to keep up with the inflation it is trying to foster.

The Fed itself, in its semiannual Financial Stability Report last week, said it worried about risks coming from soaring asset prices.

Druckenmiller told CNBC he has “no doubt whatsoever that we are in a raging mania in all assets.”

Looking at TBT, you can see how it has fallen due to the Fed's influence.  But you have to know a lot more than looking at a chart and saying ""yea I get it.""  Because you likely don't.  For example, these ETFs have serious tracking errors which makes options bets on them even riskier than normal.  Second, a good chunk of the drop on TBT is also due to the effect of interest payments...so people not in the know of how that works are betting without knowing the 'rules'.  
There are some real risks in the trade...if the fed proves to be kinda right...or if they use more of their toolz to push rates from rising anytime soon, or if we have a major world event, geopolitical boom-boom.  
Anyway, bonds tend to move inverse to interest rates.  Fed can control those rates.  Hence why the Fed is pretending to be in total denial of the inflation that is happening in front of our face. High rates tend to hose tech companies....borrowing, etc.  If inflation rises, interest rates are likely to rise.  Killing the housing market which is also hot. IN the 1970s we had huge inflation...the mortage rates were something nuts... like almost 20%!",,

Regarding large cap vs smaller cap - can’t really go too wrong with either, as long as you’re diversified.

It offers less privacy than banking... Every transaction you make is public and immutable. if you send someone Bitcoin they can see other transactions you have made. If I buy a burger with my credit card the vendor can't see every other thing I've ever bought.

Saying it offers more privacy and it's also 100% public are two contradictory statements...

Past that, the average person does not give a shit about privacy. People post their entire lives on the internet, no one cares if a bank can see where they spend money.

I understand the uses of an immutable linked list that can only be appended to via a consensus algorithm

Which is why I understand that comparing software to software makes more sense than comparing software to a precious metal. Bitcoin is a network, tiktok is a network, it's more similar then you think.

sure, can you give an an example  of any blockchain product that is a better product than what already exists and can you express why an average user of the existing product would switch? Do this without talking about the price of the coin increasing.



>Whether you think it's reached its absolute peak in value, will become worthless, or will stabilize, or remain volatile forever more is all opinion, conjecture and can't be stated with any kind of fact.

See this is the core problem, you think only in price but you can't express why any price is justified. I'm asking you to express why anyone would use a new product over a competitor they have already used their entire lives. 

>... this all started because I pointed out that as a store of value compared to gold, 12 years is 'early' considering gold has been used as a store of value for 5000 years. lol

Yes and I pointed out that a element is not the same thing as software, something that you haven't actually responded to. When comparing attributes, bitcoin is as similar to gold as it is to shit... In 5,000 years from now the Bitcoin software you can download today won't even function, Bitcoin might not even exist anymore, on the other hand gold will still be gold unless we do some pretty hardcore manipulation of atoms.


What you are saying is the kind of thing someone who doesn't actually understand the tech says, it's marketing buzzwords. Do you also think that Bitcoin let's people be their own bank, that's equally wrong...


So after all that, let's try again. I'm an average westerner with a bank account, why should I use(not invest in) Bitcoin over what I already have.",,

You didn't, the whole conversation is above. You asked ""Can you name a single reason why I should **use** Bitcoin? Not invest in but **use**.""

&#x200B;

>You literally did, you said that I should use Bitcoin instead of my bank because it offers better returns than a savings account...

Well you're misusing the word 'literally' as I mentioned interest rates, I never once said ""numbers go up"" - which you quoted me as saying, and then doubled down on by saying I literally said it, when I *literally* didn't.

Technically interest rates are offered by exchanges not bitcoin per se... so there's that I guess. But those interest rates are still better than what a bank offers ( \~ 6% APY)

&#x200B;

>Yes and I pointed out that a element is not the same thing as software, something that you haven't actually responded to. 

Because no one claimed that bitcoin was an element. I still don't claim bitcoin is an element. People *liken* it to 'digital gold' generally, lazily perhaps.  You're making strawman arguements.

I agree with you, it's software. I already said I agreed with you. You're getting caught up in semantics. But it's software that society/culture has given as a store of value - which is why it's often compared to gold. 

&#x200B;

>See this is the core problem, you think only in price but you can't express why any price is justified.

Supply and demand, like any tradeable asset. I can't justify why a Pokemon card is worth $200k or why certain artwork is worth $millions. That it's digital code has pretty much nothing to do with it.

It's worth what anyone is willing to pay.

&#x200B;

>When comparing attributes, bitcoin is as similar to gold as it is to shit... 

Point to me where society and culture ever attributed shit as a store of value. Horseshit doesn't count. 

&#x200B;

>What you are saying is the kind of thing someone who doesn't actually understand the tech says, it's marketing buzzwords. Do you also think that Bitcoin let's people be their own bank, that's equally wrong...

I'm not marketing on trying to sell bitcoin to anyone. Like I said, I don't hold any and I wouldn't buy as an investment right now either. I do think blockchain has its uses though - I listed some of them.

Futures are moving higher this morning, with the Dow and S&P up about 0.4%. Nasdaq is 0.2% higher. This follows a rebound yesterday when tech booked major gains (Nasdaq rallied 1.8% and is now on track to break a four-week losing streak).

Another post-pandemic low in initial jobless claims yesterday does appear to have helped. Goes to show that just when you don’t see any catalysts for a rally, investors come in and bid things up. This tends to happen in bull markets. We’re still in a bull market. Probably will be for a little while.

Cryptos have even bounced a bit. On that note, hope you listened to the [weekly podcast with Jacob Ma-Weaver](https://contrarianpod.com/content/podcasts/season3/regulatory-risk-facing-cryptocurrencies-jacob-ma-weaver/) on crypto regulation. One thing we didn’t even speak about was the IRS. Yesterday the Treasury department came out and said there would be stricter tax reporting requirements. So regulation is coming for cryptos. Whether that removes their utility is another question.

Today we have purchasing manager surveys out at 0945. . That’s it for economic data releases. No major earnings reports either. May be a quiet day. May see more buying, as tends to happen in bull markets. Oh wait, I already said that.

I am looking for advice.

Long story short. I got a bunch of cash.  I am a US citizen, who lives outside the US.  Idealy I would like to have a house/property in US, but don't need to live thereanytime soon.  Long term however, I do want to buy a house in Washington state.  I do not think currently it would be a good idea. I would preferebly like to avoid buying into the current housing market.

The quetion is what on earth do I do with the money.  My understanding is, I can avoid taxes, if I buy back into the pyramid scheme of US property within a year.  If I buy just property, will that be tax exempt?

In the mean time, what should I do with th money? 

If I do nothing it will be deflated away, I am paranoid of going all in on this market.  What is a safe investment that I can place the money in, to beet inflation but not get wrecked by market correction?

Let's go back and look at what you actually said

>> I'm a normal Canadian, why would I ever use bitcoin over my current bank?

Sure looks like the only reason you can articulate why I should use bitcoin over a bank is that it acts as a better interest savings account when also conveniently we ignore risk. 




> Because no one claimed that bitcoin was an element. I still don't claim bitcoin is an element. People liken it to 'digital gold' generally, lazily perhaps. You're making strawman arguements.


I mean you did, if you want to liken it to a digital product then compare it to digital products... what's the average lifespan of a digital product again? how many digital products last even 20 years?


> I agree with you, it's software. I already said I agreed with you. You're getting caught up in semantics. But it's software that society/culture has given as a store of value - which is why it's often compared to gold.

So you agree this software will likely not exist in it's current form in even 20 years? not exactly a good store of value...


> Supply and demand, like any tradeable asset. I can't justify why a Pokemon card is worth $200k or why certain artwork is worth $millions. That it's digital code has pretty much nothing to do with it.

These are collectables, you never claimed bitcoin was a collectable, are you saying bitcoin is a collectable? Because I'll agree with that, how you describe it, bitcoin sure does seem pretty useless.


> It's worth what anyone is willing to pay.

If I find a sucker I can convince to but something at an inflated price that doesn't mean the price is going to stay that way forever. we are in a discussion about investing which means you actually have to justify your position. If your only argument is that ""Today someone will buy it"" then we know the price is likely going to go down at some point.


> Point to me where society and culture ever attributed shit as a store of value. Horseshit doesn't count.

You mean fertilizer? it's used several orders of magnitude more than Bitcoin. 



> I'm not marketing on trying to sell bitcoin to anyone. Like I said, I don't hold any and I wouldn't buy as an investment right now either. I do think blockchain has its uses though - I listed some of them.

The uses you listed are already done in a combination of better/faster/cheaper by other products that people already use on a daily basis. Again, you can't just express a use, you need to explain why it's better than the competition that's already used by almost the entire population. 

blockchain also has uses, sure. Anyone with a small amount of technical knowledge can make one in <2 hours. It's not like we are talking google search here, it's a combination of 3 concepts that we've known about for decades.


> Already stated, that those benefits don't appeal to you is your personal choice and I'm not here to change your mind. You quite clearly stated you don't give a shit about privacy, good for you.

So bitcoin has no uses for the average person?

Again, bitcoin does not offer privacy, it's pseudo anonymous, once someone can identity one transaction from you they can identify all transactions you made from the same wallet.
