I bought it as a meme stock when I first started investing (betting at this point) at $21 CAD.  I've lost over half my money on it so I've been keeping an eye on articles and it's literally a coin toss as to whether they say it's the next biggest thing or it's going nowhere.  100% of them say that they can't really recommend one way or another.

And yes taxes hurt economies, but the impact of taxes can be offset somewhat by spending the tax revenue.   The best plan by far is just offering everyone a pro-rata credit based on all carbon taxes collected.  E.G. if a carbon tax in the US generates $300 billion in revenue each quarter, each citizen will get a quarterly check for $1,000 (assuming 300m people).   Net cost to taxpayers is zero, but those who fly more and eat more meat and own humvees will lose relative to those who don't travel and take the bus.

Yes, it would still be a net detriment to the economy in the short term (as we would be pushing people away from the most efficient and cheapest fuel sources), but presumably we should be willing to take that hit in order to do more to fight climate change.",,

All the car companies that are competing with F have debt. Which ones are profitable without government handouts & loans or a side hustle? They are valued by their potential EV sales 5, 10 or 20 years into the future. 

I can’t go to the local dealership lot and buy an all EV truck (with a bed)  from anyone else yet, can I? 

Why is F held to a different standard? Maybe because their CEO doesn’t love to tweet or he is not a “strong woman”.  F has been around a long time and has a new CEO who wants to compete in the EV market. I wouldn’t count them out.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

I work for company that is part of large multinational conglomerate that owns many other companies in the same sector. Our parent company is listed on NYSE. However, it is considered low P/E and high dividend value stock that recently got quite expensive so I don't own any stocks of it. Also... knowing how things work from the inside... I actually don't really want to hold any shares of this company... At least not at the current price.

Regarding owning shares its no big deal. We get little training videos about how we are not supposed to trade on insider information and how we are not supposed to trade shares just before and after earnings but other than that, no problem, anyone can own company's shares and I don't think you need to declare anything to HR. Also, we have shares ownership programme where employees are allowed to buy company's share at a discount. I think it's buying shares at cheapest price that quarter or something like that. Didn't really look into it much.

Looking forward to hearing from other people.",nknzhl,People who work for publicly listed company. Do you own shares of company you work for?

If you say ""stocks"" that's a reference to plural different companies.  

So you could say you bought 100 shares of Ford, not 100 stocks of Ford.  

If someone says they bought 5 *stocks*, that would imply they bought shares of 5 different companies.  

All that said, my advice would be to treat owning a stock like owning an animal: it needs to have a certain amount of care and attention all the time.  Do homework on it.

**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, May 26, 2021**

Stocks mostly consolidated today, finishing modestly higher led by a 0.34% gain in the Nasdaq (QQQ). After the volatility experienced in the first weeks of May it is very encouraging to see market volatility calming down and holding on to recent gains. Market participants continue to closely monitor incoming inflation data, though it seems fears that the Federal Reserve will be forced to tighten monetary policy have tempered.

New economic data released yesterday shows consumer confidence dipped in April, compared to March, even as more social distancing restrictions were lifted across the US. The Conference Board (a non-profit research organization), released their April Consumer Confidence index which showed sentiment falling steeper than expected. The report showed the consumer confidence index dipped to 117.2 in May from 117.5 in April. However, on the positive side, April's reading was the highest since February 2020, before the start of Covid-19 lockdowns. Economists expected consumer confidence to rise to 119.5. 

Yesterday, members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), reiterated their stance that they were not yet concerned that new inflation data would force the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be “mostly temporary” and that the Fed was “not quite there yet” when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be “overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.” 

Richard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, also said “there will come a time in upcoming meetings” when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that “it is going to depend on the flow of data”. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.

This reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldn’t worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.”

**Highlights** 

* Great vaccination numbers coming out in the US. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United States has administered 289,212,304 doses of COVID-19 vaccines in the country as of Wednesday morning and distributed 359,849,035 doses. 165,074,907 people had received at least one dose, while 131,850,089 people are fully vaccinated as of Wednesday morning. For context, the entire US population is roughly 328.2 million.
* Amazon (AMZN) announced that former CEO of Amazon Web Services Andy Jassy will formally take over as CEO of the e-commerce giant on July 5. A few months ago, Jeff Bezos, current CEO and founder, announced he was stepping down and transitioning to a role as the Executive Chairman.
* Shares of Ford (F) jumped more than 8% after the company said it was raising it’s investment on electric vehicles from $22 to $30 billion. The company recently announced the all-electric F-150.
* Amazon announced it was purchasing Hollywood movie studio MGM Holdings for $8.45 billion, bolstering Amazon’s streaming service. Mike Hopkins, senior vice president of Prime Video and Amazon Studios said, “The real financial value behind this deal is the treasure trove of IP in the deep catalog that we plan to reimagine and develop together with MGM’s talented team. It’s very exciting and provides so many opportunities for high-quality storytelling ""
* Mortgage applications slid by the most since early April last week, with a decline in refinances dragging down overall loan volumes even as purchases ticked up for another week. The Mortgage Bankers Association's (MBA) weekly market composite index for mortgage applications fell 4.2% during the week ended May 21. This followed a 1.2% rise during the prior week.
* Volkswagen sold more than 206,000 electric vehicles over the past 12 months in Western Europe, more than double the 102,500 made by Tesla over the same time period, according to Schmidt Automotive Research.

Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos will step down on July 5, turning the helm over to cloud-computing boss Andy Jassy.

""We chose that date because it's sentimental for me, the day Amazon was incorporated in 1994, exactly 27 years ago,"" Bezos said Wednesday at Amazon's annual shareholder meeting, which was held virtually.

Amazon announced in February that Bezos would leave his post later this year. Bezos will transition to executive chairman of Amazon's board and is expected to dedicate more time toward initiatives like the Bezos Earth Fund, his Blue Origin spaceship company, The Washington Post and the Amazon Day 1 Fund.

The company had kept its succession plans quiet, though onlookers speculated that either Jassy or Jeff Wilke, who retired from his post as head of Amazon's worldwide consumer business last August, would be Bezos' eventual successor.

**START HERE:** [“If You Can” by William Bernstein.](https://www.etf.com/docs/IfYouCan.pdf)

If you want an expanded version of that, Bernstein’s book “The Four Pillars of Investing” is amazing.

I am not a fan of buying individual stocks and prefer buying all of them via index funds. Here’s another Bernstein article on that:

[The 15-Stock Diversification Myth ](http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/900/15st.htm)

> … **a grossly disproportionate fraction of the total return came from a very few ""superstocks""** like Dell Computer, which increased in value over 550 times. If you didn’t have one of the half-dozen or so of these in your portfolio, then you badly lagged the market. (The **odds of owing one of the 10 superstocks are approximately one in six.**) Of course, by owning only 15 stocks you also increase your chances of becoming fabulously rich. But unfortunately, in investing, it is all too often true that **the same things that maximize your chances of getting rich also maximize your chances of getting poor.**

> …even 100 stocks are not nearly enough to eliminate this very important source of financial risk.

> So, yes, Virginia, you can eliminate nonsytematic portfolio risk, as defined by Modern Portfolio Theory, with a relatively few stocks. It’s just that nonsystematic risk is only a small part of the puzzle. Fifteen stocks is not enough. Thirty is not enough. Even 200 is not enough. **The only way to truly minimize the risks of stock ownership is by owning the whole market.**

Added bold for emphasis. This is an argument in favour of index fund investing over stock-picking.

Now, it’s possible for will continue to do well, and *may* turn into one of those “super stocks” Bernstein mentions. That’s a gamble though. IMO, most people would be better off with an index fund for most of their investments, maybe save a few percent for single stock gambles.

I hope this helps!",,

# The Balance Sheet

>A  balance sheet shows how much a company is worth, also known as the  ""book"" value. It lists the value of a company's assets, liabilities and  shareholders equity.  
Like the Income Statement, it is often shared on a quarterly or annual basis.

# Overview of whats in it

# Assets

>An **asset** is defined as anything owned by a company that holds inherent, quantifiable value.

**Current assets** include anything a company expects it will convert into cash within a year, such as:

* Cash and cash equivalents
* Prepaid expenses
* Inventory
* Marketable securities
* Accounts receivable

**Noncurrent assets** include long-term investments that aren’t expected to be converted into cash in the short term, such as:

* Land
* Patents
* Trademarks
* Brands
* Goodwill
* Intellectual property
* Equipment used to produce goods or perform services

A **liability** is the opposite of an asset, it's something a company ***owes***.

**Current liabilities** refer to any liability due to the debtor within one year, which may include:

* Payroll expenses
* Rent payments
* Utility payments
* Debt financing
* Accounts payable
* Other accrued expenses

**Noncurrent liabilities** refer to any long-term obligations or debts which will not be due within one year, which might include:

* Leases
* Loans
* Bonds payable
* Provisions for pensions
* Deferred tax liabilities

Liabilities may also include an obligation to provide goods or services in the future.

# Shareholders Equity

**Shareholders' equity** refers to anything that belongs to the owners of a business after any liabilities are accounted for.

* Common stock
* Preferred stock
* Treasury stock
* Retained earnings

If  you were to add up all of the resources a business owns (the  assets)  and subtract all of the claims from third parties (the  liabilities),  the residual leftover is the owners’ equity.

# Dueling Views:

**Record of capital invested:**  There are some who believe that the main function of a balance sheet is  to record how much a business has invested in its assets-in-place,  i.e., the assets that allow for its current operations to occur.

**Measure of current value:**  There is a large and perhaps dominant school of thought among  accountants, or at least accounting rule writers, that a balance sheet  should reflect the value of the business today.

**Liquidation value:**  There is a third school, with lenders to the firm among its primary  members, who feel that a balance should reflect what you would get for  the assets of the firm, if you liquidated them today.

# Fixed and Current Assets

**The Old Way:** Two or three decades ago, the way you were taught to value fixed and current assets was to show them at **original cost, net of accounting depreciation.**

**The New Way:** As accounting has increasingly adopted the **fair value standard**, there has been a move to mark assets to current market value.

**Divergent Effects:** The difference in values that you get for assets, using the two approaches, varies. It is:

* **Greater on older assets than on newer ones**
* **Greater on fixed assets than current assets**

# Financial Assets

* Financial assets can be holdings of securities or part ownership of other companies, private or public.
* With  holdings of publicly traded securities, the movement to using current  market prices to mark up their values is almost complete.
* With equity ownership in other companies, the rules can vary depending on:  

   * Whether  the stake is viewed as a majority stake (>50%) or a minority stake.  The former will lead to full consolidation (where 100% of the  subsidiaries revenues and operating income will be included in the  parent company’s financials, with the portion that is not owned shown as  minority or non-controlling interest on the liability side) and with  the latter, the actual stake will be shown as an asset.
   * With  a minority stake, whether it is held for trading or as a long-term  investment. With the former, the holding will be marked to market. With  the latter, it will be shown at book value terms.

# Intangible Assets

**Big game:**  Accountants talk a big game when it comes to intangible assets, and  from that talk, you would think that they have figured out how to value  the big intangibles (brand name, management quality etc.).

**But different reality:**  In reality, accountants are much better at valuing small-bore  intangibles like licenses and customer lists, where the earnings and  cash flows from the intangible are observable and forecastable than they  are at valuing the big intangibles.

Goodwill

* After  all the talk of intangibles in accounting, it is telling that the bulk  of intangible assets on accounting balance sheets across the world take  the form of one item: **goodwill.**
* Goodwill is a plug variable that signifies little.  

   * For goodwill to manifest itself on a balance sheet, a company has to do an **acquisition**.
   * When that **acquisition occurs**, goodwill is measured as the **difference between the price paid on the acquisition and the target company’s asset value (dressed up book value).**
   * It shows up as an asset because **without it in place, balance sheets would not balance.**

# Goodwill Impairment:

**Old rules:**  For much of the last century, goodwill once created in an acquisition,  was written off on autopilot, often amortized over long periods in equal  installments.

**New Rules:** In the late 1990s, both **GAAP** and **IFRS**  rewrote the rules, requiring accountants to revisit goodwill estimates  each year, and make judgments on whether the goodwill had been impaired  or not. To make that judgment, accountants would have to revisit the  target company valuations and decide whether the value had increased (in  which case goodwill would be left unchanged) or decreased (and goodwill  would be impaired).

**Is it informational?**  The rationale for this rule change was to provide information to  markets, but since goodwill impairments are often based upon market  pricing movements (in the sector) and lag them by months and sometimes  years, the effect of goodwill impairments on stock prices has been  negligible.

# Current Liabilities

**Current liabilities can be broadly broken into three groups:**

* **Non-interest-bearing** liabilities, such as accounts payable and supplier credit, which represent part of normal operations.
* **Interest-bearing** short-term borrowings such as commercial paper, short term debt and the short term portion (<1 year) of long term debt.
* **Deferred** salaries, taxes and other amounts due in the short term.

When  computing non-cash working capital, we do not include interest-bearing  short term debt in the calculation, moving it instead into the debt  column.

# Debt Due

When companies borrow money, it can take three forms:

1. **Corporate bonds**, represent debt raised from public markets
2. **Bank loans**, debt raised from banks and other lending institutions
3. **Lease debt**,  arising out of lease contracts requiring lease payments in future  years. Until 2019, only leases classified as capital leases qualified,  but since 2019, operating lease commitments are also debt.

The **mark-to-market movement** on the **asset** side of the balance sheet has been muted on the **liability**  side of the balance sheet. Bank debt, for the most part, is recorded as  originally borrowed, and corporate bonds due, are for the most part not  marked to market.

# Debt details

While  balance sheets are the repositories for total debt due, broken down  into current and long term, there is additional information on debt in  the footnotes, for most companies.

**This additional information can be on three fronts:**

1. Individual debt due, with stated interest rates and maturities.
2. Additional features on the debt, including floating/fixed and straight/convertible provisions.
3. A consolidated table of when debt repayments come due, by year.

# Shareholder’s Equity

**Old ways:**  The shareholders’ equity in a business was a reflection of its entire  history, since it started with the equity brought in to start the  business, adds on equity augmentations over time as well as the  cumulation of retained earnings.

**New ways:** The shareholders’ equity in a business reflects the jumbled mess of mark-to-market accounting, with all of its contradictions.",nlsjyp,Accounting 101 - Part 2: The Balance Sheet

DOOH means ""Digital Out of Home"" advertising. This is basically all of the digital signs and advertisements you see outside of your home.

Airports, waiting rooms, car dealerships, hair salons, anywhere you are, there are advertisements all around.

Especially as we are a very visual society now because of smart phones and the internet, this is a remarkable arena that doesn't get as much attention as it should!

This company is an emerging player that has a very unique platform that could dominate in the space. Imagine a technology that allows customers to edit content in real time to improve your customers’ experience!

ALF provides solutions that bring transparency and accountability to the digital out of home advertising marketplace. Since 2018, the company has been developing its artificial intelligence advertising platform to deliver targeted advertising in an ethical and privacy-conscious manner.   manner. As an AI enterprise SaaS platform company, they are powering computer vision with machine learning models to allow content publishers and brand owners to deliver interactive, intelligent information without violating user privacy.


Trading on the NASDAQ gives ALF a lot more exposure...

The fact that the stock has a very small trading float of around 138,000 shares is also something to pay close attention to.

This is a limited amount of shares available for public trading as as more of Wall Street uncovers the company, the rule of supply and demand could come into play here. What happens when supply is limited but demand is high?

It's Economics 101.. the price goes up....

Earlier this month shares of ALF were as high as $5.60!

The amazing thing is that they debuted at $2.41. The stock saw a jump of nearly 100% in a matter of days.

With the nature of how fresh ALF is to the Wall Street scene, anything could be possible here.

But if share prices were to head back to the 52-week high, it could mean upside of over 70%!

ALF has a “BUY” rating from Investing.com and is “VERY BULLISH” on many other sites.

He invested in RV stocks and sure enough it worked out. It's much easier to research a company when you are part of the ecosystem.

The next step is do research on areas you're interested in. If you're curious about gene editing or robotics, it makes researching the companies working on it that much easier. When you get caught up, companies will pop up with what they're doing in the space and you'll be better informed about whether a company is positioned to capitalize on that market.

LMP Motors $LMPX 's business model as “Buy, Rent or Subscribe, Sell and Repeat.” This means that we “Buy” pre-owned automobiles primarily through auctions or directly from other automobile dealers, and new automobiles from manufacturers and manufacturer distributors at fleet rates. LMPX Rents or Subscribe” by either renting automobiles to our customers or allowing them to enter into our subscription plan for automobiles in which customers have use of an automobile for a minimum of thirty (30) days. LMPX then sells its inventory, including automobiles previously included in our rental and subscription programs, to customers, and then we hope to “Repeat” the whole process.

**IPO and Price History:**

LMPX IPO'd in December 2019 at 5$ per share and has steadily increased throughout the past 18 months, reaching a peak of $45 earlier this year. It has since retraced in price and is currently trading at $15.8. This retracement is largely due to investors believing revenue guidance for 2021 was overstated based on December 2020 Q4 revenues of 4M.

**Revenue Growth and Forecast:**

LMPX reported 10.8m of revenues in 2019 and grew revenues to 30.4m for 2020. Representing a 180% increase in Revenues YoY.

LMPX forecasted revenues of 29m to 31m for Q1 2021 representing a 650% increase in revenues from Q4 2020.

LMPX full year 2021 revenues forecasted at 535 million

&#x200B;

Shareholders called out the CEO on these revenues forecasts after Q4 results and the stock subsequently sold off.

**Q1 2021 Earnings Preliminary Numbers (To be reported after close tomorrow)**

LMPX quietly released its preliminary numbers last week directly to the SEC.

&#x200B;

Reporting Revenues of $33m, representing 725% increase in revenues from the previous quarter.

Gross profit increased to 6M from 500k the previous quarter.

Cash increased of 1.4M to 19.4m through net operating cash flows.

These preliminary numbers beat the Q1 Guidance of 29M-31M by 15%.

The earnings call tomorrow will prove to shareholders and investors that this company is achieving substantial growth and the the forecasts are obtainable.

Guidance for the 2021 year is expected to increase above its 535 million to 570 million+.

**EBITDA:** EBITDA expected at 4.4% for 2021 of total revenues amounting to 25million which is to be used for repayment of loans on recent acquisitions.

**Valuation to Peers:**

**CVNA:**

Market Cap of 44.7B

Sales of 5.5B

P/S: 8.12

Revenue growth YoY: 41%

**VRM:**

Market Cap of 5.9B

Sales of 1.3B

P/S: 4.53

Revenue growth YoY: 14%

**LMPX:**

Market Cap of 158M

Sales of : 33M for Q1 (570M 2021 full year)

P/S: 0.27 (based on 2021 revenue Guidance)

Revenue growth YoY: 1766% (2020 to 2021 growth)

**LMPX** **Fair Value based on 2021 Sales:**

Market Cap: 2.5B

Share price: $256

P/S: 4.5

**Used Auto Market Growth:**

The used car market is booming, making it a perfect time for resellers. The shortage of new cars as a result of the global chip prices has demand for used cars surging.

Used car prices have jumped 21 percent since April 2020 and 10% of that came directly during April 2021.

&#x200B;

This factor alone should drastically increase guidance for 2021 above the 535 forecast. April price jumps and demand surge will be reflected in next quarters earnings resulting in increased guidance.

**Key Acquisitions and Business Moves:**

LMPX has been making key acquisitions over the last few months which will help play into the bottom line.

**LMPX Acquisitions:**

Hometown Subaru - May 2021

2 Dodge/Chrysler Dealerships - April 2021

Bachman Bernard Chevy Buick Dealership - April 2021

New Ecommerce Website - March 2021

LTO Holdings Acquisition - February 2021

Atlantic Auto Group Acquisition - February 2021

Landed 660M syndicate credit line for use of Acquisitions - January 2021

LMPX started off the year with a bang and secured 660m of credit to use towards acquisition's. Which has been put to use over the first 5 months, purchasing multiple auto groups and dealerships. Securing backlogs of inventory and entering into new markets throughout the U.S. These acquisitions will be even more profitable with the recent 10% surge in used car prices in April 2021.

**Float:**

LMPX currently has 10.01m shares outstanding of which 4m are owned directly by management/insiders. Making the tradeable float roughly 6m. The lower the float means the quicker the price moves. Institutional holdings is low but I expect it to drastically increase after tomorrows earnings resulting in a even smaller tradeable float.

**Summary:**

LMPX will report revenues of 33M tomorrow representing a 725% increase from prior quarter. This will bring back investors who dumped their shares after the CEO was called out for ""overstating guidance"". This earnings report will beat expectations by 10-15% and Revenue guidance is expected to be bumped higher to the high 570 million range. New investors will be drawn in from the quarter over quarter growth reported on the call. The recent boom in used auto prices and demand will further excel LMPX as a market leader. If LMPX continues to exceed revenues estimates and obtain 550M+ revenue for 2021 its fair value compared to its peers should be at $250+ a share representing a 1582% increase from its current share price.

Get in on the ground floor tomorrow before the earnings call. LMPX ran today as investors started to catch on to the SEC filing of preliminary numbers. We should see a 20% + move after hours tomorrow and quick run back to its ATH of $45.",nltnxv,LMPX - LMP Motors - Growth Monster and Earnings Beat Coming Tomorrow

576,,2021-05-26 23:29:28,t3_nlufsp,,stocks,"VIAC stock jumped 3.81% today to $42.46 as rumours around a buyout continue to intensify, and I believe this is just the start. Several analysts agree with me, setting an average price target of $54 for the next 12 months.

I know it's been dismissed as a meme stock for the last wee while, due to the crazy rise and fall with the Archegos ‘incident’ and the hype around a possible pump after that implosion. But hear me out: I believe VIAC is actually a great value opportunity, with a solid 25-50% medium term upside.

There are a several reasons, which I’ll detail below, but essentially they have become a major buyout target as the streaming wars heat up between Netflix, Amazon, Disney and Apple. WarnerMedia (HBO) and Discovery just announced a huge merger, and Amazon has announced it would buy Hollywood studio MGM for just under $9 billion. That’s moving attention and speculation onto VIAC.

First, let’s analyse the quality of the business. ViacomCBS is a traditional broadcaster with a huge content library, that is currently pivoting from that dying business model and transitioning into streaming for obvious reasons. It is one of the world’s biggest content creators with its streaming service Paramount+ (rebranded from CBS All Access) carrying a content catalogue of 30,000 episodes, 2500 movies and 1000 live sports events. They are also diversifying with a free ad-driven service named Pluto TV, and premium offering Showtime.

Did I mention they have rights to the Superbowl? Content is king in streaming, and they have a huge number of popular shows and movies for a range of ages. To name a couple, they have StarTrek, NCIS, 60 Minutes, The Godfather, Indiana Jones, Mission Impossible, Top Gun, Hawaii 5-0, Teen Mom, The Late Late Show with James Cordon, Survivor, Key & Peele, Big Brother, The Amazing Race along with traditional offerings like CBS news.

One of their best attractions and a major competitive advantage in my view is their huge children’s content library through Nickelodeon, making them an attractive option for families. Titles include Spongebob Squarepants, PAW Patrol, Avatar: The Last Airdender, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Dora the Explorer, Blue’s Clues and much much more. The list is very long, and this in particular has been driving subscriber growth recently.

Despite all of this, the company is one of the cheapest current offerings in streaming, due to a bizarre collapse in their stock price which has nothing to do with them. They were bought by an aggressive hedge fund named Archegos Capital, which collapsed in March, tanking the share price from $100 to $37. It appears that hedge fund had artificially elevated the price to reach those astronomical levels, but I believe at $42 it’s still below its intrinsic value.

For example, the stock’s P/E ratio is around 9.5, compared to the wider film and TV industry’s average P/E of 29.8. Discovery’s P/E for example is 22, Netflix is insane at 60. At the very least I believe this represents an opportunity to get into the streaming market for a cheap entry point, as demand is expected to increase by 20% annually for the next decade.

They make a lot of money having recently beat earnings (and beating the 4 earnings before that), and continue to outperform, picking up an extra 6 million subscribers for Paramount+ over the last 3 months. That will intensify as they expand to new areas (they’re moving to Australia) and start to prioritise streaming more as, for example, the new Top Gun reboot will be on P+ two months after it hits theatres.

But most importantly, the extremely low share price and its huge content library makes it an attractive buyout proposition for bigger players with cash to burn like Amazon or Apple. There are way too many providers in streaming right now, some will sink and some will swim, and having a content library like ViacomCBS would be a major jewel in the crown.

Netflix in particular is vulnerable in my view, as traditional broadcasters are refusing to licence their content to them while they create their own streaming services, forcing them to pivot to creating more original content. That’s extremely expensive to make and they’re picking up massive amounts of debt while they do this.

Overall, ignore the pump and dump bullshit that’s been floating around on WSB for the last couple of months, I believe VIAC will only become more attractive as the streaming space consolidates. Every merger and buyout makes them more valuable, and I believe the consolidation will speed up as the big players need to move fast to avoid being left behind.

I have a small holding (40 shares, averaged at $41.50) and I’m hanging in for a 50% gain over the next 12-24 months. I'll continue to buy anytime it dips below $40.

I brought up specialty drugs as an example of how the CVS PBM forces payment through an in house pharmacy--rather than any other one. Most commercial plans feature maintenance choice, which generally restricts maintenance drugs to CVS or the mail order pharmacy. Some plans feature an opt out option, and some plans feature the retail 90 plan design which isn't restrictive. Your plan may be one of these. Which leads me to B.

B) If you bothered reading anything I said you'll notice where I repeated the word ""most."" Most plans are restrictive. Some are not. If you call up Walgreen's yourself they would tell you most Caremark plans will not pay at their pharmacy for maintenance medications beyond grace fills, if that. The ability of the PBM to steer patients to a specific pharmacy is its moat; as I said most Caremark plans will not pay for drugs at Amazon.

I've been studying stocks and charts, and I've only been paper trading on webull. Trying to get a good understanding of things before getting my feet wet. I'd like to get into being a patten/swing trader eventually. I've still got a long way to go, but I'm committed. 

I see some really good gains on stock warrants,  and I've traded a few just playing around and done really well with them in the paper account. 

I genuinely try to stay away from the comments section on any stock, just for the fact that everyone and their mother thinks that the stock they've invested in is going to ""sky rocket to the moon"", regardless of how the chart is looking and I don't have time for mental games.

But I still glance at the comments every now and then. And it seems that anytime I look a comments on stock warrants, they seem get a bad rep, or people get belittled for bragging about about their gains because ""it's not a stock, it's a stock warrant""

So I've strayed away from warrants temporarily until I know more about them, because I don't want to waste my time practicing something on my paper account, if I'm not going to be able to apply it on a real account. 

It all boils down to two questions. Can stock warrants be traded like a regular stock? And if so, are the short term capital gains tax rates similar to that of a regular stock?",nlv5hd,Stock warrants?

Your terminology on both revenue and expenditures are likely incorrect, at least when speaking in context of publically traded entities which use the accrual basis of accountanting and not cash basis. When a company ""brings in"" money is not important. What is important is when revenue is recognized and when expenses are inccurred, these are not necessesarily duirng the same peroid of time when cash is collected or spent. 

If I sell you a good in Q4FY21 but you don't pay me until Q1FY22, the revenue is still recogized in Q4FY21. Same with expenses under the accural basis. 



>For most firms, revenue recognition is a simple process, where once a product or service is sold, it is recorded as revenues.

Business wishes this was true but it's absolutly not lol. Even in the transacting of a seemingly simple single good of services there are countless contengicies and contract terms that can impact the recogniction of revenue.

But from what's been pieced together, this is what I think the chain of events are: When the short seller's debt exceeds their margin, the broker liquidates collateral to settle the debt. When the debt is so high the brokers can't solve the debt, the clearing entities liquidate the brokers. This chain continues all the way up to the DTCC and eventually the Feds. As far as I understand it (and I could be wrong, I'm not an expert on this), the DTCC originally never believed any of its members would run into such a financial shit show. They literally didn't have any mechanisms in place to protect the market from a financial black hole. This is one of the reasons (believed) for the flurry of rules being passed lately. The DTCC's job is to make sure people get their money and the market doesn't shatter, after all.

At the end of the day, the money will have to come from somewhere. Even if that results in money printing from the Fed (hence Dr Burry's prediction of hyperinflation). If GME share holders don't get paid, then it becomes an international fraud issue. And I don't think the US government wants international fraud across hundreds of countries. 

Of course, this is the hypothetical if the squeeze does happen. Nothing is certain.",,

Here are two scenarios I’d like to do. I don’t think they exist though. Can anyone suggest an alternative and/or a quick explanation on why they won’t work?

1) Buy stock at $10. When it hits $15 I want an automatic stop order placed at $12. This is close to a trailing stop loss but looking for something with more concrete amounts.

2) I want to place two orders at once and have one automatically cancelled if the other triggers. See stock around $10. Create order for $9.50 and $10.50. If it drops great I get a normal limit order, if it rises I don’t want to be left behind so I’ll buy some at higher amount if I have to. But I don’t want to buy double if it dips then rises.

Are either of these possible? Trying to not stare at screen all day but also pretty particular about trades. So I’m hoping a complex buy order could do both at once.",,

Well, no, not really.

First you have to pay borrowing costs in addition to the interest you pay on your margin account. And the borrowing costs depend on how difficult it is to borrow that stock. So for something undergoing a short squeeze the borrowing costs snowball higher and higher.

Second, as the price of the stock increases, so do your short ""losses"" or amount of money you owe. If this gets too high then you'll get margin called.

So you can't just remain short forever waiting for the price to drop.

This will only happen if people sell. But if they know too many people are short and nobody sells then the price just goes up and eventually shorts will be forced to cover.",,

Second, yes they are stable. Let's be real, nobody is building any more railroads. Railroads are land owners for the right-of-way the tracks are laid on, asset holding companies for the rails, locomotives and rolling stock, and major freight/intermodal players. Backtested against the SP500, they blow it out of the water over the last 20 years with practically zero risk giving how essential they are to the country.

I'll give ya a quick rundown on the remaining 5 Class I railroads:

BNSF - privately owned by Berkshire Hathaway. I own some BRK.B because of this. Really, really wish they were public. Best of the bunch for US rail, imo.

UNP - largest public US railroad. Covers Western US. They haul everything across the country. Rate of stock gain is 2nd to last, but I can't imagine owning railroads without UNP in there. 

CSX and NSC - East coast/Midwest freight hauling coal/intermodal/commodities. Growing exponentially in terms of value. Good buy

CNI - just merged with KSU (Kansas City Southern) to create the only Canada-US-Mexico point-to-point railroad. Great entry point right now too as they paid so much for KSU that their stock took a 13% drop due to the debt taken on. Until now, rate of stock gain has been slowest of the 5 railroads, but should this merger go through long-term they may be the best hold.

CP - far and away my favorite holding. Their rate of growth is incredible, their financials strong, their leadership the best in the business. They along with CNI are the only Class I railroads in Canada. Their stock regularly takes 8% dips then roars back, so I'd wait for a better entry point or DCA in with a small initial.

Of course, do your own DD, but that's my take from a guy whose been holding these a long time. About 30-40 years ago there were 100s of railroads. Soo Line, Wisconsin Central, etc etc etc. They've all been bought out by these 5, making them stronger and resistant to competition than ever, and thus laws were passed against any more mergers due to monopoly concerns. The CNI-KSU merger is likely the last we will ever see, and it's still no sure thing as the STB (Surface Transportation Board) has not approved it yet as it would make CNI too strong. I consider each of these railroads as akin to Google essentially owning the internet. Nobody is coming for them. 

Lastly, they all recently underwent PSR (Precision Scheduled Railroading) which is a new way of moving freight, instead of going when a unit train is full, they run at set times, regardless of manifest cargo, in order to keep cars moving and customers from waiting. This has enormously cleaned up operations costs and efficiency for all involved, and railroads are now operating in the 21st century with better revenues than ever.

There is too much negative pressure on Amazon from world governments and general public on variety of things. Plus Bezos retiring, Jassy won’t have the same mindset.

Ecommerce competition is heating up daily basis. Azure and G cloud have gotten significantly better and continue to do so.

I also don’t like Amazon dipping it’s toes into so many things. I wish it focused on just dominating global commerce and AWS. Now it’s Pharmacy, Food, movies, etc. 

Given all of that, Amazon is worth $1.7T. It will be difficult to increase the market cap x3+ anytime soon. I think the money will see a better ROI in other companies moving forward. I rode Amazon for 8 years, I’m done with it. Too much risk and not enough reward potential.

756,,2021-05-27 00:56:44,t3_nlw1q0,,stocks,"Federal health officials have approved the first passenger cruise from the U.S. from Fort Lauderdale in June — but Florida’s governor insists he will block company plans to require passengers be vaccinated.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wednesday gave Royal Caribbean Group approval to start seven-night cruises to the Caribbean on its Celebrity Cruises brand ship, Celebrity Edge, on June 26, according to a CDC spokesperson. The ship is the first to win CDC approval for revenue cruises since the COVID-19 pandemic began.

The approval is a welcome milestone for the cruise industry, which has been paralyzed in the U.S. since March 2020 after COVID-19 outbreaks and deaths on several ships.

“For the past 15 months our conversations with friends and loved ones about seeing the world have been accompanied by the phrase ‘someday.’ I’m beyond proud and excited to say that day has arrived,” said Celebrity Cruises CEO Lisa Lutoff-Perlo in a statement. The June 26 cruise will leave from Port Everglades and visit Mexico and The Bahamas.

The CDC recommends all cruise passengers be vaccinated, but doesn’t require it. The agency has given cruise companies two options: meet vaccination thresholds of 98% of crew and 95% of passengers on the ship and start revenue cruises immediately, or forego the thresholds and first perform test cruises to ensure COVID protocols are working. Cruise ships that meet the threshold will have more relaxed mask and social distancing rules.

Celebrity Cruises spokesperson Susan Lomax said the company has opted to comply with the CDC’s vaccination threshold and will require all crew and passengers 16 years old and older to be vaccinated. The age requirement will drop to 12 years old on Aug. 1.

The go-ahead for Celebrity Cruises follows the CDC’s approval — also the first of its kind — of test cruises with volunteer passengers aboard Royal Caribbean International’s Freedom of the Seas ship from PortMiami in late June. Freedom of the Seas will require all crew and passengers 16 years old and older to be vaccinated, but will not meet the agency’s vaccination thresholds — meaning it must first perform test cruises before revenue cruises can begin.

Royal Caribbean Group is the second largest cruise company in the world with three cruise lines: Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Silversea.

The restart plans clash with a law recently passed by the Republican-controlled state Legislature and promoted by Gov. Ron DeSantis that bars businesses, schools and government entities across Florida from asking anyone to provide proof of a COVID-19 vaccination. Under the new law, which takes effect on July 1, businesses can be fined up to $5,000 per violation. The only exemption in the law is for licensed healthcare providers.

“We’ve been very clear, the law is clear in Florida,” said Taryn Fenske, spokesperson for the governor. “You can’t mandate vaccine passports. We are interested to see how the CDC works with them so that they don’t get these exorbitant fines.”

Celebrity plans to restart its cruises days before the new law takes effect. Lomax said the logistics of its vaccine requirement are still being worked out.

“We are working with the Governor’s office to align on the path forward,” she said via email.

DeSantis sued the CDC last month, asking a judge to force the agency to drop its cruise safety requirements and allow cruises to begin immediately. The judge instead sent the case to mediation, which begins Thursday.

Wednesday’s approval signals long-sought relief for the cruise industry, which first began working with the CDC to restart cruises last October under a conditional sail order issued by the agency. Cruise companies had to enhance COVID-19 testing capabilities on their ships, report weekly crew test results to the agency and secure agreements with ports and local health authorities in the cities they plan to visit.

PortMiami will welcome volunteer passengers on board Royal Caribbean International’s Freedom of the Seas for a two-day test cruise on June 20. PortMiami also submitted an agreement to the CDC with Carnival Cruise Line that has not yet been approved.

A good stock for investing in is also a good stock for daytrading most of the time. What we look for as day traders is a company with good fundamentals, and at least two solid quarters of earnings/growth. Then we look at how much volatility the stock has. Volatility within a range is excellent for us. Say you have 25k in your account and you found a stock thats been performing above and beyond expectations for at least two quarters. You then need to identify the normal range of that stock. Keep an eye on it in a watch list. Learn its daily patterns. One day when you notice that it's fallen below it's normal trading range, and there's no news to support that drop...we usually look for a 5% drop on growth stocks...that's when you buy shares. Depending on the price of the underlying stock, we try to trade anywhere from 100 shares to 10k shares on a single stock, in multiple lots. Your goals, and thus earnings will be different from others with different size accounts and risk tolerances. I started out with a goal of $50 per trade and was happy with that. Then as I learned the ropes I slowly increased my position sizes and thus my earning potential on individual plays. I usually trade between 500 and 2000 shares per position, and I look for $200+ as my exit. I set limits and take profits so I can move on the the next play or re-enter the same ticker again and again and again. I've played a single ticker probably 10 times in a single day.

I don't short. That's not for me. I only play to the upside, and only on solid stocks, because if the position goes against me after I buy in, I know that I will be able to get back out in time. Usually within a few days.

I hope this helps you get some idea about what you could potentially make, and how you might go about picking a good potential stock for trading. Paper trading is only good for practicing entries and exits on your platform of choice. It does nothing for you actually executing when there's real money on the line though. That's why you only trade what you're comfortable losing on any given position.

Let me know if you have any other questions!",,

I've had a few small OTC stuff with $100 thrown here or there in my account, this was my first foray into the real stock market.

Sold AMC last week at a loss, thought better of it, then bought it back in the dip. Cost basis went up (wash sale), so set a sell limit today and exited AMC when it dropped this morning.

Basically AMC at this point is pump and dump trading by WSB subreddit.

Sold for a loss today because it was tanking pretty hard in the am a few times. My cost basis was adjusted from the wash sale, so total loss playing around with AMC was like $30.  Now it's up to $15+ again this afternoon??? Can't deal lol

Is it often stocks jump by $2-3 in a day at 15% gain/loss when the stock price is in the teens? I think not, unless big news for investors, no major news really for AMC or AMCs business plans so that's why it's mostly pump and dump, or a small squeeze at this point, but short float was 20% as of April 30th with millions of shares sold and bought each day since with probably a constant adjustment of the shorting of the stock going on.

I only make two or three ""high-conviction"" trades per year. When I trade, I go big with serious conviction. I want to tell you about my biggest trade ever - Molson Coors (3500 shares @ $55.44). I've also got a bunch of options that expire in October.

I am not a ""technical"" trader. Nor am I a ""fundamental"" trader. I'm a guy who follows Chris Camillo & and the Dumb Money ""social arbitrage"" style of investing. Chris has over a decade of 60%+ annual returns. The goal in this style of investing is to find game-changing information about a company that Wall Street doesn't know, research it like crazy, put on a trade, and then wait for the suits on Wall Street to discover the information when the company announces quarterly results. When game changing information is discovered by the suits in New York, they buy like crazy and drive the price up.

If you want to read more ""fundamental"" analysis on $TAP, read [this awesome due diligence](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvb868/molsoncoors_beverage_co_tap_dd_reopening_play/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) over on WallStreetBets from u/undream22.

**Background of the Trade:**

Molson Coors is an old company. They make the majority of their money off of cheap beer (e.g. Coors Light, Miller Lite, & Miller High Life). For the last 4-5 years, their stock has sunk because cheap beer is losing market share to hard seltzers and higher margin specialty beers.

Truly & White Claw took over the seltzer market which is growing quickly. FYI - hard seltzer's are way more profitable than beer.

The company got a new CEO who implemented a ""Revitalization Plan"" and is heavily investing in more profitable ""above premium"" beverages to make more money off of their huge distribution network. The important beverages include (but are not limited to) the following:

* Topo Chico Hard Seltzer
* Zoa - Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnston's energy drink
* Vizzy Hard Seltzer

**Thesis of the Trade:**

Molson Coors has three huge winners on its hands ***and Wall Street has no idea***. Once Molson Coors starts reporting actual numbers from Topo Chico, Vizzy, & Zoa at the end of this quarter they are going to crush all the analyst earnings estimates. This will lead to the big boys on Wall Street buying up TAP and driving up the price.

**Why Doesn't Wall Street Know Yet?:**

While the analysts certainly know that Molson Coors is distributing these beverages, they simply don't realize how big of a deal these drinks are. They don't know this because 1) the recent quarterly numbers do not reveal it, and 2) Wall Street doesn't pay attention to store checks, Google Trends, or the power of social media.

Let me explain:

* Topo Chico Hard Seltzer was released to the public on March 29, 2021. This preliminary launch was limited to nine select markets. Two days later, Molson Coors' Q1 ended.  **So, Wall Street doesn't have any actual numbers on Topo Chico Hard Seltzer yet**. I recommend that you listen to the Q1 call (April 29th). In the Q1 call, the CEO only talked briefly about getting unexpected market share in Texas with Topo Chico. However, based on the Dumb Money community channel checks (Check our our Discord group), stores in every market where it was released are selling Topo Chico HS like crazy. Topo Chico is selling as good (if not better) than Truly and White Claw. This is a huge deal. Moreover, Google Trends show people are searching ""topo chico hard seltzer"" more than ""truly hard seltzer"" and more than ""white claw hard seltzer."" That is amazing. And it was only released in NINE markets. It might be way bigger when it gets release to the rest of the country. Finally, #TopoChico is trending on TikTok and Instagram. Don't underestimate the power of social media.
* Zoa was released on February 24th (2/3's into Q1). Aannnddd, it's release was initially limited to online sales and select in-store sales. **Any numbers from Zoa were de-minimis in Q1 results**. They are expanding their distribution, and Dumb Money members are finding it in grocery stores now. Just spend a few minutes looking at the Rocks Instagram feed to see how hard he is pushing this drink. The branding is excellent and he has over 239m followers on Instagram and 15.2 million on Twitter. Google Trends show people are searching ""zoa energy drink"" just as much as ""monster energy drink"" and more than ""red bull energy drink."" Think about that for a second. A bran new energy drink is just as sought after as two established brans that own the market. Again, Don't underestimate the power of the Rock on social media.
* Last quarter Molson Coors had **two** **unexpected events that significantly reduced earnings**. 1). The Texas freeze shut down their biggest manufacturing plant in Fort Worth, Texas, for several days - impacting earnings. 2). They had a cybersecurity event that shut down production even further. Read/listen to the last earnings call to learn more about these two one-off events. This obviously cut into earnings last quarter and yet they still beat estimates. My guess is that so long as they don't have any enormous and unexpected events during Q2, they are going to crush earnings.
* Vizzy was launched in 2020 in the middle of the pandemic. Google Trends shows it is now starting to compete with Truly and White Claw. It is a ""healthier"" hard seltzer because it has vitamins (I guess). This competition came from only one variety pack. They just released a new lemonade version that is getting much higher reviews that competitors. Moreover, Dumb Money store checks show it is selling out in Canada.
* I expected the next two quarters are going to be gangbusters for the entire industry - lifting Molson Coors and all the other alcohol companies. Think about it. The vaccine is highly distributed finally. Summer is coming. So many people are going to have BBQ's, go to baseball games, go on vacations, and just let loose. And it is the summer of hard seltzerI don't think Wall Street understands how big pent-up demand is for having a good time. Alcohol is going to flow this summer unlike anytime we've ever seen before. TAP is the ultimate recovery play.
* From a fundamental analysis, TAP is highly undervalued in comparison to its competitors. Just take some time and look at $BUD, $SAM, $STZ and you'll see what I mean. Again, if you want to read more ""fundamental"" analysis on $TAP, read [this awesome due diligence](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvb868/molsoncoors_beverage_co_tap_dd_reopening_play/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) over on WallStreetBets from u/undream22.

Anyway, I'm tired of typing now. That is my trade. I hope someone appreciates this write-up.

Three final things:

1. If you want to know more about Chris Camillo, YouTube his famous Bloomberg interview. Also, he was recently featured in a recent ""Unknown Market Wizards"" book by Jack Schwager. Oh, and he wrote his own book back in the day called ""Laughing at Wall Street."" It's a great read.
2. I also HIGHLY recommend watching Dumb Money Live's episode on YouTube called ""Going ALL IN on $TAP""
3. I also HIGHLY recommend watching an older Dumb Money Live episode called ""Billion Dollar Energy Drink? Investing in ZOA from Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson""

Stocks traded mostly sideways today, managing to mostly hold on to recent gains, despite new data on consumer confidence coming in below expectations. After the volatility experienced in the first few weeks of May, recent price action has been more encouraging to me. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 0.2% down, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 0.15% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.22% down. 

Today, the Conference Board (a non-profit research organization), released their April Consumer Confidence index which showed sentiment falling steeper than expected. The report showed the consumer confidence index dipped to 117.2 in May from 117.5 in April. However, on the positive side, April's reading was the highest since February 2020, before the start of Covid-19 lockdowns. Economists expected consumer confidence to rise to 119.5. 

A separate report by Standard & Poor’s said that its S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller national home price index posted an annual gain of 13.2% in March up from 12% in February and marking 10-straight months of acceleration in home prices. The results far outpaced analysts’ expectations of a 12.5% annual gain, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. According to a recent Reuters poll, U.S. house prices are forecast to outpace GDP growth and consumer inflation — rising at a blistering pace to average 10.6% this year, almost double the 5.7% predicted in February. With demand rising faster than supply, it is not surprising to see home prices surging forward, with economists expecting the growth to taper once supply rises to meet demand. Total housing inventory at the end of April was 1.16 million units, down 20.5% from one year ago — the lowest level since NAR started tracking homes for sale in 2011. Inventory, however, was up 10.5% from March, an indication that homebuilding is picking up.

Today, members of the Federal Open Markets Committee reiterated their stance that the Fed was not yet worried about rising prices forcing the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be “mostly temporary” and that the Fed was “not quite there yet” when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be “overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.” 

**Highlights**

* Reddit-stocks like Gamestop (GME) and AMC are once again on the move higher.
* The court case between Epic Games and Apple (AAPL) s expected to end this week as both sides prepare closing arguments. As a reminder, Epic Games is accusing Apple of antitrust behavior by taking a 30% commission from sales in the app store and blocking companies from using third-party payment options. Apple says it prevents third-party software to ensure consumer protection and the commission is in-line with other app-store developers, like Alphabet. The result of this case will have very wide ranging implications.
* Amazon (AMZN) is reportedly nearing a deal to buy the Hollywood studio MGM for roughly $9 billion, in a deal that would turn the movie studio into a streaming asset for AMZN. According to people familiar with the matter, a deal could close as soon as next week.

# Profile: Is this company real?

1. Website
2. Address, Google Maps of HQ
3. LinkedIn
4. Wikipedia
5. Social Media Accounts
6. News Articles
7. Key Executives

# Financials:

1. Look through the latest **income, balance sheet and cash flow statements**
2. Calculate **YoY and QoQ** **growth** for at least 10 years (or less if the company is young) for each of the 3 financial statements
3. Calculate different **valuation ratios and metrics** to see how they **stack up against their competitors**
4. Look through **Analyst** Estimates, **Investment Bank** ratings and **DCF** figures

# Documents:

1. Read through recent **earnings call transcripts** to get a feel for how executives communicate and how honest they have been in the past quarters.
2. **SEC Filings**: Read through proxies, prospectuses and more to get a full picture.

# Insider Activity:

1. Find out how many I**nsider Buys and Sales** have been made in the past 6 months.
2. Look into who these insiders are, what they're role and functions are within the company.

# Ownership:

1. Find out which **Mutual Funds, ETFs and Hedge Funds** own the stock, how much of it and when they last bought/sold shares.

# Social Sentiment:

1. Scan through **Reddit, Twitter, Facebook Groups** for ticker/company mentions to see if the conversation is bullish or bearish. Beware, this can be misleading due to spam and trolling.
2. **Google Keyword Research:**  This is especially useful if the company provides a consumer product or  service, I like to find out how often its mentioned and find any spikes  in online searches.

# Future:

1. What products and services are planned for the future?
2. What are the industry/sectors innovations, needs and wants?
3. What are competitors developing and are planning on releasing?
4. What markets is the company looking to penetrate?
5. What cultural/societal shifts and trends might effect the companies roadmap?

When this deal was announced May 17th DISCA and T were on fire. Premarket I was watching shares catch fire and go above $43 on DISCA. Later on during the day, I did decide to start trading it as it fell to $34. In my opinion close to $34-35 is a fair value for the stock without a deal!

DISCA now has 15 + million subscribers for their 4.99 service. Expectations were for 8. We all know the streaming is the wave. As we see also with Netflix and Disney there is enough for them all provided we have rich content. In the most recent report DISCA beat on top line and said that the streaming business added 4 million subs in just the last 2 months. This business is alot more profitable. Current bottom line is about 2.79 for the year, next year is about 3.25 without factoring in the rapid streaming and more profitable side of the business. This yields a PE ratio of this year near 11 and next year under 10! Doesn't that sound cheap for a large company that will grow sales between 10-15%?

This is all before the Warner Media deal.... So in my mind DISCA is worth 34-35.... On it's own its executing and turning the business around.....so now with Adult Swim, Boomerang, Cartoon Network, CNN, TBS, TNT, TruTV, Turner Classic Movies, Turner Sports, HBO..... now its worth less?

I understand we won't be able to see the full details and synergies yet.... this deal may or may not even close! It will be at least 6 months out.... but in the mean time DISCA which has been delivering is getting crushed? This combines to be close to a 50 billion company...... Unfortunately, T paid over 85 billion, and there is still alot of debt. But please help me figure out how DISCA isnt worth at least 35..... 

Should we just can the deal and fight to stop the merger? Is that what the market is saying? That combining all that and maybe charging 14.99 for HBO and Discovery + and maybe having 100 million subscribers is not good?...... Do we see what it is doing for DISNEY? Just shaking my head here.

They are much less space. They are cheaper than gas and most importantly pretty much anyone, any age can use a bike! I tried to research as much as I could the exact number of bikes in China but I could not find that unfortunately. The 600 million estimate was as close I could find.

Most importantly we may be able to make an investment. EZGO is the Ebike and IPO’ed early on in January. The execution from the company has been amazing. However, the stock has come down a lot. The figures yesterday 5/24/2021 given by the CEO were 6 months thru March 31st of 2021 and did not even include some big deals. 

Let me go thru some important highlights and insights from the CEO:

**Revenue grew 224% to $16.8 Million from just $5.2 Million**

**Projected sales of 100,000 bikes in 2021 (Which was given February 17th)**

**Sales of the 2 wheel bicycles increased 50% to 23,000 units while the 3 wheel increased 600% to 11,000 units! Total of 34,000 units. (5/24/2021 The CEO gave this update and said sales have increased drastically and it expects rapid revenue growth)** 

***These numbers were for ending March 31st and does not Include the following!!!***

**4/1/2021 EZGO reports a large order from the Ukraine the stock spikes to 9.48!** **These bikes are to be delivered in April!**

**4/15/2021 EZGO signs a new contract for 10,000 Bikes after an exhibition displaying their bikes**

Their higher end bike sells for about $300 US dollars and travels 225 miles on a single charge. Most bikes are about $200 and have 150-200 Mile range. You can go to their website EZGOtech, I do not want to get banned by including links. The bikes look great!

At 100,000 bikes, could be more and 300 a bike we are looking at 30 million in sales………which is 100% growth again……. I believe that estimate is light!

Eight months ago, I made my first ""call of calls"" on a blockbuster event amongst reverse mergers.  Eight months ago, I made the ""call of calls"" on what was then a different ticker, and what now belongs to Lordstown Motors (RIDE).

And indeed, RIDE went on to become the fourth of nine realized blockbuster events amongst reverse mergers.

Then came Workhorse's loss of the USPS contract.  That was nothing, as production could continue on the main EV product.  Lordstown Motors could still take on Ford and its F-150.

Then came the Hindenburg short report.  RIDE became the second of three realized blockbuster events shorted by Hindenburg.  Like, really?

Then came the announced production delays recently, most likely due to semiconductor shortages.  The commercial EV startup's chances against Ford got dashed big time.

Then came something bigger and more unfortunate for RIDE bagholders: Rivian is just another EV startup.  Ford is a typical Big Auto laggard in EVs.

Not so the Next Tesla.

Not so the Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto, its proven track record in the commercial pickup truck business, and [now its own foray into EV pickup trucks](https://motorillustrated.com/volkswagen-trademarks-amarok-is-compact-pickup-coming/76784/), semiconductor shortages be damned.

854,,2021-05-26 05:08:34,t3_nl8xqa,,stocks,"I started looking at Lithia Motors ($LAD) in the past couple of weeks.  They're an automotive retailer here in the states with a Market Cap of $10.37b.  Their growth is in main accomplished through M&A of other dealerships.  

* Downsides include: 
   * susceptibility to economic downturns, 
   * if interest rates climb it will make it harder for them to offer attractive financing,
   * 2020 supply chain shortages interrupting inventory,
   * High debt levels,
   * Competitive advantages, as I see them currently, are limited:
      * small pricing advantage over smaller competitors,
      * limited protection in certain markets where regulations or distributor arrangements keep their competitors out for certain vehicle brands.
* Fundamental Numbers:
   * Free Cash Flow - went positive for the last 4 years. They ended 2020 with $381m in FCF. 
      * CAGR on FCF from 2017 to 2020 equaled 86.4%.
   * From 2010 to 2020
      * Revenue grew from $2b to $13.1b (CAGR 20.5%).
      * BVPS CAGR was 24.7% (2020 BVPS of $111.83).
      * EPS CAGR was 43.7% (2020 EPS of $19.53).
      * ROE in 2020 was 25.6% (CAGR 19.2%)
   * Total Debt in 2020 was $4.175b
   * Long-term debt was $2.311b 
   * LT Debt to Earnings = 4.92

The last few numbers are very concerning to me.  That's a whole lot of debt they are carrying!  Combined with limited economic moats.... Hmmmm.  However, I did compare their 2020 numbers to Carmax, one of their biggest competitors.  Carmax had a whooping LT Debt/Earnings ratio of 20.7, revenue of roughly $19b, and EPS of $4.52.  Carmax's growth number were also much less overall.

Given their LT debt/Earnings was roughly 1/4 of a direct competitor's and their growth numbers were looking good to me, I was continuing to do some reading and research.  Then Lithia made a rather big announcement.  They're doing a new public offering of shares valued at $1b.  At the same time they announced a private offering of $800 million in senior notes (3.875%) that would be due 2029...  Nearly another billion in LT Debt?!?!?  ARRGGHHHHH!

Looking at their 2021 Q1 presentation, they do give target uses of capital, which at least shows they have a plan that they are willing to publish.  Those plans are as follows:    

* Internal Investment & Modernization 25% 
   * (Actual 5-year average: 17%) 
* Share Repurchases 5%
   * (Actual 5-year average: 11%) 
* Dividends 5% 
   * (Actual 5-year average: 4%) 
* Acquisitions 65% 
   * (Actual 5-year average: 68%) 

Their stated goal in the 2021 Q1 for acquisitions is an annual addition of $3-5 billion in revenues.  They also posted good numbers for Q1 YoY and compared to the previous quarter.  However, with the debt now I feel like the research rabbit hole has gotten a little deeper for me....

**95% of it is taken word for word from Prof. Aswath Damodoran's lecture slides that he makes available for free. He teaches at NYU and has an amazing Youtube channel with full courses on various aspects of corporate finance.

# The Income Statement

**What is it?**

The income statement is one of the most common and important financial  statements you’ll come across. It’s also known as the profit and loss  (P&L) statement, summarizing all income and expenses over the period  of analysis, often shared as quarterly and annual reports.

**What is its purpose?**

The function of an income statement is to show a company’s financial performance over the period of analysis.

**What is inside an income statement?**

* **Revenue:** The amount of money a business takes in during a reporting period
* **Expenses:** The amount of money a business spends during a reporting period
* **Costs of goods sold (COGS):** The cost of component parts of what it takes to make whatever it is a business sells
* **Gross profit:** Total revenue less COGS
* **Operating income:** Gross profit less operating expenses
* **Income before taxes:** Operating income less non-operating expenses
* **Net income:** Income before taxes less taxes
* **Earnings per share (EPS):** Division of net income by the total number of outstanding shares
* **Depreciation:** The extent to which assets (for example, aging equipment) have lost value over time
* **EBITDA:** Earnings before interest, depreciation, taxes, and amortization

>*These items often contain sub categories and separate line items depending on a company’s reporting and accounting policies.*

**Classifying Expenses**

**There are three different types of expenses**

**1.** **Operating Expenses**

>**a.** Expenses associate with the operations of the business.**b.** Direct costs of producing the product/service and other expenses associated with production, including SG&A expenses.

**2.** **Financing Expenses**

>**a.** Expenses associated with the use on non-equity financing.**b.** Most often taking form of interest expenses on debt.

**3.** **Capital Expenses**

>**a.** Expenses that provide benefits over many years.**b.** For a manufacturing company these can be plant & equipment.**c.** For non-manufacturing companies they can be less conventional and tangible forms.

**Their Placement**

>***No images allowed on the sub, so here's a link:*** [*https://imgur.com/WCDqBee*](https://imgur.com/WCDqBee)  
>  
>📌 **SUMMARY:**  Operating expenses associate with operations of the business, financing  expenses with non-equity financing and capital expenses with ones that  provide benefit over many years.

Revenue Recognition

For  most firms, revenue recognition is a simple process, where once a  product or service is sold, it is recorded as revenues. For firms that  sell products or services over many years (eg. subscriptions) it becomes  trickier.

**Under ASC 606 (new revenue recognition standard):**

* The  new model’s core principle for revenue recognition is to “depict the  transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that  reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in  exchange for those goods or services.”
* Thus,  for a real estate developer working on a multi-year construction,  revenues should be recognized as construction progresses, and for a  software firm that enters in a contract over many years, performance  obligations will determine when revenues get recognized.

>**📌  SUMMARY: For most firms, when a product or service is sold, it is  recorded as revenues. For firms that deal with long term contracts,  memberships, subscriptions etc. revenue is recorded depending on sum and  duration - eg. $120,000 for 1 year of service = $10,000/month recorded  revenue.**

Revenue breakdowns

As companies enter **multiple businesses and different geographies**, it is useful to know **where they generate their revenues.**

**Where** are **geographic breakdowns found?**

* While the breakdown can **sometimes** by provided in **income statements**, they are more likely to be part of the **footnotes to the financial statements.**
* Companies generally break down ***revenues by geography***, though the degree of detail can vary.
* Companies also break down ***revenues by business segment***, though there is an element of **subjectivity to the segment categorization.**

>**📌 SUMMARY:** Companies generally **break down revenues by geography** with a varying degree of detail and **revenues by business segments**  subjective to the segment categorization. Both can sometimes be found  in the income statement, but generally they are found in the **footnotes of the financial statements.**

Operating expenses: Breakdown

Operating  expenses are broken down into expenses directly related to producing  the goods or services that give rise to revenues, i.e. cost of goods  sold, and expenses that are related to operations, but which are not as  directly tied to revenues.

**How** are operating expense broken down?

1. Expenses directly **related to the production** of goods / services that **increase revenues.** These are **netted out** form **revenues to get gross profits.**
2. Expenses related to operations, not directly tied to revenues. These are **netted out** from **gross profits to get operating income.**

**SG&A Costs**

1. In many companies, the **largest** **non-operating expense is S, G & A**, a term that can include everything but the kitchen sink.

>**📌 SUMMARY:** Companies **break down revenues** by how they **relate to production** or **operations.** The **former tied to the increase of revenues,** the **latter not.**

Depreciation

There are three forms of depreciation; **economic, accounting & tax depreciation.**

1. **Economic Depreciation**

This reflects the **loss in value (earning power) in an asset, as it ages.** It requires nuance, and will vary across even the same type of assets, depending on how it is used.

2. **Accounting Depreciation**

This is more mechanical and is **driven largely by the aging of the asset**, with the differences often being in whether it happens **uniformly over the life of the asset or is more accelerated.**

3. **Tax Depreciation**

This reflects what the tax authorities will allow as **depreciation for purposes of computing taxable income.**

>**📌 SUMMARY: Economic** depreciation reflects **loss in value (earning power) in an asset, as it ages.** **Accounting** depreciation is **driven by the aging of an asset,** **depending** if it occurs **over the life time of the asset or in a more accelerated period.** **Tax** depreciation reflects **what authorities allow as depreciation** for purposes of **computing taxable income.**

Financial expenses

The most common financial expense is **interest expense on debt**, either in the form of bank loans or corporate bonds.

**Some interest expense is implicit**

As accountants classify other **commitments (such as leases) as debt, some of the interest expense is implicit**, i.e., it is calculated by accountants **based upon their assessment** of the **debt equivalent value of commitments and current interest rates.**

**If interest income exceeds interest expense, this number will measure net interest income.**

In some companies, **interest expenses are netted out against interest income earned by the company on its cash holdings** and **financial investments**, and **reported as a net interest expense**. If interest income exceeds interest expense, this number will measure net interest income.

>**📌 SUMMARY:** Most **common financial expense is interest expense on debt**, either **bank loans or corporate bonds.** Accountants classify **other commitments (leases etc.) as debt,** making some **interest  expense implicit and calculated based on their assessment of debt  equivalent value of commitments and current interest rates.** Some companies net out interest expense against interest income earned on cash holdings and financial investments. If **interest income exceeds interest expense, this number will measure net interest income.**

Income from non-operating investments

Income  earned from cash & marketable securities are reported different  then income earned from cross holdings in other companies.

**Cash & Marketable Securities**

**Income earned on cash holdings** (which is invested in marketable securities, like treasury bills and commercial paper in most companies) will be **reported either as a stand alone income or netted against interest expenses.**

**Cross holdings** in other companies

* Reporting can vary upon the magnitude of your holding:
* When you hold a (**small or minority**) portion of **another company,** the **income** from that holding will **usually be reported in the income statement.**
* If you hold a **majority stake of another company**, you will generally **have to consolidate your financials.** You will **count 100% of the subsidiary’s revenues,** **operating expenses and operating income as your own.**

>**📌 SUMMARY: Income earned** on **cash holdings** will be reported either as a s**tand alone income or netted against interest expenses. Income** earned from **minority stake** in a company will usually be reported in the **income statement.** If you hold a **majority  stake of another company, you will consolidate 100% of it's revenues,  operating expenses and operation income as your own.**

Extraordinary Income/Expenses

As the term implies, extraordinary income and expenses are designed to capture what a company **does not face in the ordinary course of operations.**

**Extraordinary** items include:

* **One-time expense or gain** from **sale of assets or divisions**
* **Write offs or charges** associated with **past project, lawsuits or fines**
* **Impairment of goodwill from acquisitions** in the **past**

**Truly extraordinary** items:

* If an item is **truly extraordinary**, it should show up **infrequently** and the amount associated with it **should vary**.

>**📌 SUMMARY: Extraordinary** items and expenses capture what a company **does not face in the ordinary course of operations**. If an item shows up **regularly and consistently, it is not extraordinary.**

Income Statement Analysis

There are **two** **methods** to read and analyze financial documents: **vertical and horizontal analysis.**

**Vertical Analysis**

>***No images allowed on the sub, so here's a link:*** [*https://imgur.com/tsbdF73*](https://imgur.com/tsbdF73)

This  method of analysis, as the name suggests, is top – down. You look up  and down the income statement to see how each line compares to revenue  as a percentage.

This type of  analysis makes it simple to compare financial statements  across periods  and industries, and between companies, because you can  see relative  proportions. It also helps you analyze whether performance  metrics are  improving.

Vertical analysis isn’t  always as immediately useful as horizontal  analysis, but it can help  you determine what questions should be asked,  such as: *Where did costs rise or fall? What line items are contributing most to profit margins? How are they affected over time?*

**E.g** – here we have the total dollar amounts and the percentages side by side

**Horizontal Analysis**

>***No images allowed on the sub, so here's a link:*** [*https://imgur.com/Zkgy21y*](https://imgur.com/Zkgy21y)

This method of analysis focuses on **year-over-year (YoY) or quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) performance.**

Horizontal  analysis makes financial data and reporting consistent per  generally  accepted accounting principles (GAAP). It improves the review  of a  company’s consistency over time, as well as its growth compared to   competitors.

Because of this,  horizontal analysis is important to investors and  analysts. By  conducting a horizontal analysis, you can tell what’s been  driving an  organization’s financial performance over the years and spot  trends and  growth patterns, line item by line item. Ultimately,  horizontal  analysis is used to identify trends over time—comparisons  from Q1 to  Q2, for example—instead of revealing how individual line  items relate  to others.

**To perform horizontal analysis you:**

1. Take the value of Period N
2. Divide it by the value of Period N-1
3. Subtract 1 from that number to obtain percentage change

>**E.g –** ***Revenue in 2017 was $4,000 and in 2016 it was $3,000. The YoY change in revenue is $4000/$3000 – 1 = 33%.***",nlhcci,Accounting 101 - Part 1: The Income Statement

869,,2021-05-26 13:59:44,t3_nlhpv3,,stocks," LONDON — A Dutch court on Wednesday ruled oil giant [Royal Dutch Shell](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/RDS.A) must reduce its carbon emissions by 45% by 2030 from 2019 levels.

That’s a much higher reduction than the company’s current aim of lowering its emissions by 20% by 2030.

Shell’s current [climate strategy](https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/the-energy-future/our-climate-target/_jcr_content/par/relatedtopics.stream/1621314462494/d53de79d4e951642456e928cdfd18b0a1867cf4d/our-climate-target.pdf) states that the company is aiming to become a net-zero emissions business by 2050, with the company setting a target of cutting its CO2 emissions by 45% by 2035.

CNBC contacted Shell to request a comment on the ruling.

Shares of Shell were trading 0.3% lower in London. The stock price is up almost 10% year-to-date, having tumbled nearly 40% in 2020.

The lawsuit was filed in April 2019 by seven activist groups — including Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace — on behalf of 17,200 Dutch citizens. Court summons claimed [Shell](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/RDSA-GB)’s business model “is endangering human rights and lives” by posing a threat to the goals laid out in the Paris Agreement.

Under the Paris Agreement — a landmark deal adopted in 2015 and signed by 195 countries — nations agreed to a framework to prevent global temperatures from rising by any more than 2 degrees Celsius, although the accord aims to prevent global temperature rises exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius.

At Shell’s annual general meeting last week, shareholders [voted overwhelmingly in favor](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/18/shell-secures-backing-for-climate-strategy-but-growing-minority-rebel.html) of the company’s energy transition plans — but, crucially, a growing minority rejected the strategy, insisting the oil giant needed to do much more in the fight against climate change.

Activist investor Follow This said at the time that the result was likely to mean Shell would have to revise its climate targets once again.

According to Reuters, the case is the first in which activists have taken a major energy firm to court to compel it to overhaul its climate strategy.

When the lawsuit was filed, a lawyer acting on behalf of environmental groups said the case would “raise the pressure” on other fossil fuel companies.

Quantum computers use quantum entanglement of laser light to create superimposed values: 1 or 0, 1 and 0, 1 and 1, 0 and 0 (1 qubit). Not many know this, but when you have Google Chrome, Steam, and Spotify all open, your computer is switching off between processing power very quickly because binary only works in 1 or 0! A quantum computer can truly actually be processing more than 1 thing at the same time, because it can be 1 or 0, 1 and 0, etc.!

This technology can be applied to logistics, blockchains, payment networks (could potentially process near ∞/second transactions simultaneously as opposed to VISA's 1700/second), etc. The possibilities are endless and I want in!!!",nljpkq,Quantum Computing Stocks

I’m 23 years old, CPA, currently investing about $2,000 per month into individual stocks. Total portfolio is about $40k, made up of 28 stocks. Mostly high multiple tech (ARK stocks), but also some healthcare, big tech, and REITs. I also have a Roth that I contribute $500 per month.

I won’t need the money for 20-30+ years, and I’m comfortable holding through volatility. My focus is really just finding quality companies that will be long-term winners. My question is:

1. How many stocks is enough to be adequately diversified as the portfolio grows? I feel i could cut down to under 20 stocks and concentrate in my top holdings. 

2. I’ve been aggressively buying stocks on the way down and trimming positions on the way up. How often should I be taking profit? Does this strategy make sense long-term?

Story: So I have recently decided, I want to eat way less - to no meat and therefore had a lot of exposure with plantbase food and alternatives. I read some articles about this topic and I am now convinced, that the market for plant base food could have a bit of potential. 

Not just because vegetarien-diet is in the uprise, but because the alternatives get better and better (imo). This makes them a direct competition to the meat industry in long term, since the taste will no longer be a major differentiator in the future. 

I mean I am far for an expert and would not give my arguments too much weight , but I kind of want to be invested in one, or a few companies, that are in this branche.

I really have not thought about writing in this subreddit and just went with a stock i randomly read about. This was kind of a mistake i guess, because I invested in this stock, and since then it lost 70% of its value.

In my life, I have developed a love for Restaurants. The unlimited drinks at a cheap price, the quality boneless Buffalo wings, I love it all. However, there is one thing I have noticed researching Restaurant stocks (starting with my favorite screener, Finviz): many of them are overvalued. Granted, the COVID 19 Disease has plagued and closed many restaurants; so its’ understandable if a restaurant temporarily loses money. However, if a company has little cash, negative cash flow, and a lot of debt, it is likely that the company will either had to get acquired by a speculator, reorganize, or, liquidate. I have three brief case studies that will show you how Restaurant stocks fare in the market.

**First is Dave & Busters (PLAY)**, the Restaurant/Arcade amalgamation that is also noted for their Buffalo wings. The market capitalization for the company is $2.02 billion. In terms of stock price, the company has gone up in price. From $13.23 on August 21, 2020, the company now trades at $42.45. Is it worth it? Let us find out. 

The company’s equity is only $153 million ($169 million in 2020). With long-term debt, PLAY has $596 million in long-term debt. PLAY also has $1.3 billion in operating lease liabilities (which means that PLAY has a lot of rent to pay). In simpler terms, imagine having to pay $1.3 billion for an apartment without leasing it to anyone. The apartment would go out of business. And remember, the company has not fully recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic! 

Current Assets are low for the company compared to their liabilities. PLAY has only $11.9 million in cash, with only $24 million in inventories. The company also lost $49 million in Free-Cash-Flow. Yes, 2019 had a positive of Cash Flow ($288 million), which is a good way to pay off debt. However, it will take a couple of years before the Restaurant business recovers; and cash cannot pay off the debt. The company has an Enterprise Value (Market Capitalization plus Debt minus Cash) of $3.92 billion. Finally, the company trades at over 13 times its’ book value. 

Would you invest into a company with little cash, lots of debt, loss of revenue? Probably not. 

**Second is Potbelly Corporation (PBPB)**. The company is a sandwich shop that is based in the mid-West as well as select cities in states such as Texas. Akin to PLAY, the company has gained a lot in Stock price; going up from $3.50 in November 2020 to its’ current price of $6.97. Is the company worth $193.81 million? Let us find out. 

PBPB, if invested in December 2015, would only be worth $40 in December 2020. By contrast, $100 in the NASDAQ in the same time would be worth over $260 – and that is in spite of the Pandemic. In 2018, the company lost $8.54 million. In 2019, the company lost $23.59 million despite only having $13 million less in revenue (this was due to income taxes). In 2020, the company lost $65.67 million in 2020 due to the Pandemic. 

PBPB only has $11.13 million in cash, and $3 million in inventories. Operating lease liabilities is $35.32 million, wiping out the Current Assets ($23.31 million). Total liabilities are $277.90 million compared to only $283.36 million in assets. PBPB only as $5.5 million in equity; yet, is valued at $193.81 million! Imagine buying $5.50’s worth of Lemonade for $194. Net cash provided by operating activities has gone down from $31 million in 2018 down to $18.17 million in $11.61 million in 2020. 

PBPB’s price is not worth the value. 

**Third and finally is Noodles & Company (NDLS)**

NDLS is exactly as it says in the tine: it sells Pasta meals. I have only been in there once in my life. The market values the company at $559 million. Akin to the other two food companies, NDLS has increased in Price over the past year (from $6.40 on November 2nd, 2020) to $12.34 on May 26, 2021. Is it worth the increase? Let us tune in, turn on, and drop out. 

Since 2016, NDLS has had a loss of net income four times (as high as $71.7 million in 2016) out of five.  With Cash Flows, NDLS has been variable, with last year generating only $9.12 million compared to $30.06 million in 2019. NDLS only has $7.8 million in cash and $9.6 million in inventories. Current Assets are $23.71 million. Current liabilities (including $26.1 million in current operating lease liabilities in 2020) are $58.13 million. In other words, immediate liquidity is impossible. Long-term debt is $41 million. 

NDLS may not be as bad as the other two stocks; but, it still is not worth the increase in stock price that happened this past year.

Prices should (in a perfect world) go up if the value is higher than the price. This is not a perfect world, however, and, the market does not reflect price in value sometimes. Restaurant investors beware.",nlku8p,"Restaurants, more Bloated than a Pregnant Woman:"

**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, May 26, 2021**

Stocks mostly consolidated today, finishing modestly higher led by a 0.34% gain in the Nasdaq (QQQ). After the volatility experienced in the first weeks of May it is very encouraging to see market volatility calming down and holding on to recent gains. Market participants continue to closely monitor incoming inflation data, though it seems fears that the Federal Reserve will be forced to tighten monetary policy have tempered.

New economic data released yesterday shows consumer confidence dipped in April, compared to March, even as more social distancing restrictions were lifted across the US. The Conference Board (a non-profit research organization), released their April Consumer Confidence index which showed sentiment falling steeper than expected. The report showed the consumer confidence index dipped to 117.2 in May from 117.5 in April. However, on the positive side, April's reading was the highest since February 2020, before the start of Covid-19 lockdowns. Economists expected consumer confidence to rise to 119.5. 

Yesterday, members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), reiterated their stance that they were not yet concerned that new inflation data would force the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be “mostly temporary” and that the Fed was “not quite there yet” when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be “overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.” 

Richard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, also said “there will come a time in upcoming meetings” when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that “it is going to depend on the flow of data”. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.

This reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldn’t worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.”

**Highlights** 

* Great vaccination numbers coming out in the US. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United States has administered 289,212,304 doses of COVID-19 vaccines in the country as of Wednesday morning and distributed 359,849,035 doses. 165,074,907 people had received at least one dose, while 131,850,089 people are fully vaccinated as of Wednesday morning. For context, the entire US population is roughly 328.2 million.
* Amazon (AMZN) announced that former CEO of Amazon Web Services Andy Jassy will formally take over as CEO of the e-commerce giant on July 5. A few months ago, Jeff Bezos, current CEO and founder, announced he was stepping down and transitioning to a role as the Executive Chairman.
* Shares of Ford (F) jumped more than 8% after the company said it was raising it’s investment on electric vehicles from $22 to $30 billion. The company recently announced the all-electric F-150.
* Amazon announced it was purchasing Hollywood movie studio MGM Holdings for $8.45 billion, bolstering Amazon’s streaming service. Mike Hopkins, senior vice president of Prime Video and Amazon Studios said, “The real financial value behind this deal is the treasure trove of IP in the deep catalog that we plan to reimagine and develop together with MGM’s talented team. It’s very exciting and provides so many opportunities for high-quality storytelling ""
* Mortgage applications slid by the most since early April last week, with a decline in refinances dragging down overall loan volumes even as purchases ticked up for another week. The Mortgage Bankers Association's (MBA) weekly market composite index for mortgage applications fell 4.2% during the week ended May 21. This followed a 1.2% rise during the prior week.
* Volkswagen sold more than 206,000 electric vehicles over the past 12 months in Western Europe, more than double the 102,500 made by Tesla over the same time period, according to Schmidt Automotive Research.

903,,2021-05-26 23:29:28,t3_nlufsp,,stocks,"VIAC stock jumped 3.81% today to $42.46 as rumours around a buyout continue to intensify, and I believe this is just the start. Several analysts agree with me, setting an average price target of $54 for the next 12 months.

I know it's been dismissed as a meme stock for the last wee while, due to the crazy rise and fall with the Archegos ‘incident’ and the hype around a possible pump after that implosion. But hear me out: I believe VIAC is actually a great value opportunity, with a solid 25-50% medium term upside.

There are a several reasons, which I’ll detail below, but essentially they have become a major buyout target as the streaming wars heat up between Netflix, Amazon, Disney and Apple. WarnerMedia (HBO) and Discovery just announced a huge merger, and Amazon has announced it would buy Hollywood studio MGM for just under $9 billion. That’s moving attention and speculation onto VIAC.

First, let’s analyse the quality of the business. ViacomCBS is a traditional broadcaster with a huge content library, that is currently pivoting from that dying business model and transitioning into streaming for obvious reasons. It is one of the world’s biggest content creators with its streaming service Paramount+ (rebranded from CBS All Access) carrying a content catalogue of 30,000 episodes, 2500 movies and 1000 live sports events. They are also diversifying with a free ad-driven service named Pluto TV, and premium offering Showtime.

Did I mention they have rights to the Superbowl? Content is king in streaming, and they have a huge number of popular shows and movies for a range of ages. To name a couple, they have StarTrek, NCIS, 60 Minutes, The Godfather, Indiana Jones, Mission Impossible, Top Gun, Hawaii 5-0, Teen Mom, The Late Late Show with James Cordon, Survivor, Key & Peele, Big Brother, The Amazing Race along with traditional offerings like CBS news.

One of their best attractions and a major competitive advantage in my view is their huge children’s content library through Nickelodeon, making them an attractive option for families. Titles include Spongebob Squarepants, PAW Patrol, Avatar: The Last Airdender, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Dora the Explorer, Blue’s Clues and much much more. The list is very long, and this in particular has been driving subscriber growth recently.

Despite all of this, the company is one of the cheapest current offerings in streaming, due to a bizarre collapse in their stock price which has nothing to do with them. They were bought by an aggressive hedge fund named Archegos Capital, which collapsed in March, tanking the share price from $100 to $37. It appears that hedge fund had artificially elevated the price to reach those astronomical levels, but I believe at $42 it’s still below its intrinsic value.

For example, the stock’s P/E ratio is around 9.5, compared to the wider film and TV industry’s average P/E of 29.8. Discovery’s P/E for example is 22, Netflix is insane at 60. At the very least I believe this represents an opportunity to get into the streaming market for a cheap entry point, as demand is expected to increase by 20% annually for the next decade.

They make a lot of money having recently beat earnings (and beating the 4 earnings before that), and continue to outperform, picking up an extra 6 million subscribers for Paramount+ over the last 3 months. That will intensify as they expand to new areas (they’re moving to Australia) and start to prioritise streaming more as, for example, the new Top Gun reboot will be on P+ two months after it hits theatres.

But most importantly, the extremely low share price and its huge content library makes it an attractive buyout proposition for bigger players with cash to burn like Amazon or Apple. There are way too many providers in streaming right now, some will sink and some will swim, and having a content library like ViacomCBS would be a major jewel in the crown.

Netflix in particular is vulnerable in my view, as traditional broadcasters are refusing to licence their content to them while they create their own streaming services, forcing them to pivot to creating more original content. That’s extremely expensive to make and they’re picking up massive amounts of debt while they do this.

Overall, ignore the pump and dump bullshit that’s been floating around on WSB for the last couple of months, I believe VIAC will only become more attractive as the streaming space consolidates. Every merger and buyout makes them more valuable, and I believe the consolidation will speed up as the big players need to move fast to avoid being left behind.

I have a small holding (40 shares, averaged at $41.50) and I’m hanging in for a 50% gain over the next 12-24 months. I'll continue to buy anytime it dips below $40. What do you think, have I missed anything here?",nlufsp,"ViacomCBS surging as a potential buyout target, in the latest twist in the ""streaming wars"""

I've been studying stocks and charts, and I've only been paper trading on webull. Trying to get a good understanding of things before getting my feet wet. I'd like to get into being a patten/swing trader eventually. I've still got a long way to go, but I'm committed. 

I see some really good gains on stock warrants,  and I've traded a few just playing around and done really well with them in the paper account. 

I genuinely try to stay away from the comments section on any stock, just for the fact that everyone and their mother thinks that the stock they've invested in is going to ""sky rocket to the moon"", regardless of how the chart is looking and I don't have time for mental games.

But I still glance at the comments every now and then. And it seems that anytime I look a comments on stock warrants, they seem get a bad rep, or people get belittled for bragging about about their gains because ""it's not a stock, it's a stock warrant""

So I've strayed away from warrants temporarily until I know more about them, because I don't want to waste my time practicing something on my paper account, if I'm not going to be able to apply it on a real account. 

It all boils down to two questions. Can stock warrants be traded like a regular stock? And if so, are the short term capital gains tax rates similar to that of a regular stock?",nlv5hd,Stock warrants?

Federal health officials have approved the first passenger cruise from the U.S. from Fort Lauderdale in June — but Florida’s governor insists he will block company plans to require passengers be vaccinated.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wednesday gave Royal Caribbean Group approval to start seven-night cruises to the Caribbean on its Celebrity Cruises brand ship, Celebrity Edge, on June 26, according to a CDC spokesperson. The ship is the first to win CDC approval for revenue cruises since the COVID-19 pandemic began.

The approval is a welcome milestone for the cruise industry, which has been paralyzed in the U.S. since March 2020 after COVID-19 outbreaks and deaths on several ships.

“For the past 15 months our conversations with friends and loved ones about seeing the world have been accompanied by the phrase ‘someday.’ I’m beyond proud and excited to say that day has arrived,” said Celebrity Cruises CEO Lisa Lutoff-Perlo in a statement. The June 26 cruise will leave from Port Everglades and visit Mexico and The Bahamas.

The CDC recommends all cruise passengers be vaccinated, but doesn’t require it. The agency has given cruise companies two options: meet vaccination thresholds of 98% of crew and 95% of passengers on the ship and start revenue cruises immediately, or forego the thresholds and first perform test cruises to ensure COVID protocols are working. Cruise ships that meet the threshold will have more relaxed mask and social distancing rules.

Celebrity Cruises spokesperson Susan Lomax said the company has opted to comply with the CDC’s vaccination threshold and will require all crew and passengers 16 years old and older to be vaccinated. The age requirement will drop to 12 years old on Aug. 1.

The go-ahead for Celebrity Cruises follows the CDC’s approval — also the first of its kind — of test cruises with volunteer passengers aboard Royal Caribbean International’s Freedom of the Seas ship from PortMiami in late June. Freedom of the Seas will require all crew and passengers 16 years old and older to be vaccinated, but will not meet the agency’s vaccination thresholds — meaning it must first perform test cruises before revenue cruises can begin.

Royal Caribbean Group is the second largest cruise company in the world with three cruise lines: Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Silversea.

The restart plans clash with a law recently passed by the Republican-controlled state Legislature and promoted by Gov. Ron DeSantis that bars businesses, schools and government entities across Florida from asking anyone to provide proof of a COVID-19 vaccination. Under the new law, which takes effect on July 1, businesses can be fined up to $5,000 per violation. The only exemption in the law is for licensed healthcare providers.

“We’ve been very clear, the law is clear in Florida,” said Taryn Fenske, spokesperson for the governor. “You can’t mandate vaccine passports. We are interested to see how the CDC works with them so that they don’t get these exorbitant fines.”

Celebrity plans to restart its cruises days before the new law takes effect. Lomax said the logistics of its vaccine requirement are still being worked out.

“We are working with the Governor’s office to align on the path forward,” she said via email.

DeSantis sued the CDC last month, asking a judge to force the agency to drop its cruise safety requirements and allow cruises to begin immediately. The judge instead sent the case to mediation, which begins Thursday.

Wednesday’s approval signals long-sought relief for the cruise industry, which first began working with the CDC to restart cruises last October under a conditional sail order issued by the agency. Cruise companies had to enhance COVID-19 testing capabilities on their ships, report weekly crew test results to the agency and secure agreements with ports and local health authorities in the cities they plan to visit.

PortMiami will welcome volunteer passengers on board Royal Caribbean International’s Freedom of the Seas for a two-day test cruise on June 20. PortMiami also submitted an agreement to the CDC with Carnival Cruise Line that has not yet been approved.",nlw1q0,"CDC approves first cruise ship to resume US operations, starting June 26"

Storytime:
I, big kid on the cul-de-sac, decide to open a lemonade stand and I begin to turn a profit. Some neighborhood kids want in so I take some ""magic"" rocks and sell them to neighborhood kids at $1 per rock (lets call these kids Group 1 and say these rocks can't be counterfeited or something). I tell them that each magic rock represents just a tiny bit of ownership in my lemonade stand, and that there won't be any more magic rocks in the future.

Business get even better- I keep raising the prices and people continue to wait in line for my lemonade. The company puts the money in the bank account to save up for a future lemonade stand. Other kids who don't have any magic rocks (let's cleverly call them Group 2), fear they're missing out and want buy magic rocks from the Group 1, who now refuse to sell the for $1.

Group 1: ""It was worth $1 a few days ago, sure. But do you see how successful the lemonade stand has become? The business is worth more now, meaning the magic rocks are worth more now. We'll sell them for $2.""
Group 2: ""That makes sense. Here's some money my mom's boyfriend gave me as allowance""

This continues for a few weeks- business keeps getting better, I put up a second lemonade stand, and the value of the magic rocks goes up accordingly, now going for $10 each. Pretty much everyone has ""made money"" off the magic rocks.

Some kid from r/iamverysmart asks Group 1, the professionals, some questions.

iamverysmart: ""Why are the rocks worth $10?""
A: That's the market price- supply and demand

Q: ""How could I make money on this?""
A: The price could go up in the future and you could sell for a profit

Q: ""What would make the price go up?
A: The company does well- You see there are equations for the ""natural"" price of magic rocks. These involve several variables: income, expected growth.. very complicated stuff. But magic rocks are going for less than their current ""natural"" price based on these equations. So it's a great time to buy

Q: ""Why would that make the price of magic rocks go up?""
A: Because when you own a magic rock you own part of the lemonade stand. That means its money in the bank, its lemonade, the materials that make up the stand, everything.

Q: ""But how could I get money on that?""
A: Like I said, by selling when the price increases. I understand, it's kind of confusing, but trust we've been doing this for a while and even made some money on it.

**Here’s how the company did:**

Earnings: Loss of 70 cents per share
Revenue: $190.5 million, vs. $178.5 million as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.
The company’s revenue increased by 117% on an annualized basis in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended Jan. 31, according to a statement. In the prior quarter had grown 119%. The company’s net loss widened to about $199 million from $83 million in the year-ago quarter.

“We have implemented operations that will help us show more profitability,” finance chief Mike Scarpelli said during a conference call with analysts. “We’re continuing to invest heavily in the business.”

The company also said in a regulatory filing that as of Monday it had gotten rid of its dual-class structure, in which Class A shares got one vote per share and Class B shares got 10 votes per share. The structure had been in place since September, when Snowflake stock debuted on the New York Stock Exchange. Now, all Class B shares will be converted into Class A shares.

With respect to guidance, Snowflake said it expects $195 million to $200 million in product revenue in the fiscal first quarter, which would be up 92% to 96% year over year. Analysts polled by FactSet were looking for $196.3 million in product revenue. Almost 94% of Snowflake’s revenue came from product revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter.

For the full 2022 fiscal year, the company sees $1.00 billion to $1.02 billion in product revenue, representing 81% to 84% growth, a decline from 116% product revenue growth in the fiscal fourth quarter. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected $1.01 billion in product revenue.

First, the person/kid is no longer completely in charge of how the lemonade stand is run.  The person/kid now needs a board of directors to direct him/her how to run the lemonade stand.

Plus, the iTunes Store hosts movies and shows for purchase from all the studios and buying exclusivity of an entire studio is a good way to have that reciprocated, which would be a big hit to the easy money apple makes from the cut they take on digital content sales.",,

940,gzlqry8,2021-05-27 05:05:19,t1_gzlqry8,t3_nlwxkg,stocks,"Think of it this way. Stock is ownership. 

You have a lemonade stand. It’s a successful one, as far as neighborhood lemonade stands go. You own 100%, which means that you own 100% of the equity. In the beginning, let’s say you could sell your family lemonade recipe for $100, you own some equipment worth a few grand, and you pull in a couple thousand every quarter. You want to expand, but that requires funding. You need a million dollars to buy the equipment, pay employees, purchase real estate for your stores, etc. But what do you have to offer someone who can give you that funding? 

You can offer investors $1 for every lemonade sold. That’s a royalty deal. Or you can offer them a percentage of your company. Let’s say you convince two investors your lemonade business will be a huge success. They agree to pony up $500,000 each for 25% of your company. In real life, they’d probably want riders attached to that money to reduce their risk, and board seats, but let’s keep it simple. Right now, by investing that money, they’re saying your company is worth $2,000,000 if you sold the company—yes the entire company—to a willing buyer (actually, they’re hoping someone will pay a lot more). That’s right—when someone wants to buy your lemonade company, you’re not handing them bags of lemons when they write you a check. What you hand them is your company stock. (Better be some good lemonade!)

Now you all could be wrong. The lemonade company can fail and be worth zero. No one would want to buy it. 

On the flip side though, If your lemonade is a big success, people will want to buy your company for considerably more than $2,000,000. Heck, you might earn $2,000,000 just in lemonade sales a year, in addition to the value of your equipment and real estate. Now, you could take an offer from the private equity firm that wants to give you $5,000,000 to walk away, but your original investors think people will pay a whole lot more. That’s when these investors say, hey man, you should IPO, raise more money for growth (and for our profitable exit). 

Lemonade is hot right now. So everyone wants in. The IPO values you at $20,000,000, based on your book value, your earnings, and what some folks think you can pull in over the next few years. If someone wants to come along and buy your company outright (all its stock), that’s what they’ll need to pay. Suddenly, the stock held by your original investors (assuming no dilution, keeping it simple) is worth $5,000,000. They can sell off some equity and make a nice profit. 

Those who buy in at the IPO price are making the same calculation those original investors did. That your company will grow and become more valuable to those who want to buy or control it. For a retail investor buying a small amount of stock, they’ll never get a board seat, they’ll never have a prayer of owning a significant part of the company and exerting control... but the whales, the institutional investors and large investment banks absolutely will. They’ll be paying more per share for the privilege of controlling the company via board seats or activism, and may even bid to takeover the company outright. In the belief that they can drive even more growth and value, and make your lemonade company even more valuable to future buyers. 

When you finally sell to PepsiCo for $40,000,000, the stock those IPO holders bought is worth double. The stock those original investors held? Well, let’s just say they cash out feeling very happy for themselves. 

Upon the sale of the company, there can be a few different outcomes for investors, but a cash for stock deal is one that might make the most sense to you. In that scenario, you get paid based on that $40,000,000 valuation. If you bought in much lower, you made a nice profit. 

Good example is LEAF. Worth $1 a share a year ago when the company was valued at around $37,000,000. Now the company sold to another company for $323 million. Shareholders will get $8.50 a share in cold hard cash. The company that bought LEAF isn’t paying $8.50 for air, they’re buying a company. Stock is the way the ownership transfers. 

To you, a Redditor who likely does not have a ton of equity in any company, of course stock seems inherently worthless. You will never own the company. You will never control it. You will never sell it or merge it or spin-off it’s parts or do anything to change the company’s value at all. But people far more wealthy and powerful than you will. And their intention is to always drive the fundamentals of a company to become more valuable so that part or all of it can be sold for more money. The democratic thing about stock investing is that whatever price they sell to each other for, that’s the price you can sell your stock for too.

Of course there are pumps and dumps, situations where stock values are inflated, wildly divorced from fundamentals and there’s no way the company will ever sell (or raise funds) at that price. In these cases, it’s really just gambling. But valuations tend to revert to a mean over time and represent true value. If you own stocks that are insanely overvalued (you know the ones), ideally you get out before the music stops.

In short, stock has value because it really does represent ownership. The profits a company makes that aren’t paid out in dividends are retained or reinvested in the company, and if handled responsibly, the company becomes more attractive to those who would want to buy it outright or own enough to exert influence. Ownership is power. Not for you, gentle Redditor, but for those at the top that trade the stock, it absolutely is. You just get to benefit by the money they’re willing to pay.",,

You buy the business and make some improvements. Now the company is making $2 million a year. Would you then sell the company to someone else for $10 million? Of course not. You doubled the profits, at the very least you’d want $20 million for it. 

Now let’s say instead of selling to one owner, you sell to many owners. Or instead of selling all of the company, you just sell a quarter of it. That ownership is represented by stock shares. The same concept applies. Let’s say they you sold a million shares at $20 a piece to get your $20,000,000 valuation. The majority owner would run the company, but the others would also be owners, albeit, of varying degrees of relevance. If the company profits double again, would these owners sell their shares for $20? Of course not. The company would be worth at least $40 million. So if they all sell or some sell, they’d sell their shares for at least $40. 

A company is physical. Money is worth something. So as long as a company is growing physically and making more money, it’s more valuable. And it’s owners can sell their stake at any time. 

You owning 2 shares, you have no influence on the company. But your shares are not worth less than the shares owned by someone who owns 25% of the company. In fact, if you sell, it might just be that 25% owner who buys your shares as part of a larger buy to up his stake to 30%. For him, he does have influence. Probably a board seat or two or three. And that person has the power to do things that can make the company, and his investment, more valuable. Again—those shares represent the assets of the company. 

I know this is a simplification, and shares may be valued more highly or less highly regardless of the actual fundamentals, but stock does have an intrinsic value, and that value is the value of the company’s assets and potential growth. As those assets and growth accumulate, so should the stock price and the value of that ownership, even if you only own 2 shares.",,

The more assets it has and the more value it is going to create, the more overall value it has. A successful business will grow it’s value over time, even by simply using the same assets over and over to create more goods or services. 
That is in general terms called intrinsic value. If you own stock in this company, you own a piece of that business. If you want to convert the value of that share into money ( I.e a currency system to store and transfer value that you can use in exchange for goods and services) you have to sell it to someone in exchange for said money. To do that, you have to agree with the buyer on a price, that is then paid. Markets are very effective in assessing the price of something( but not perfect). That’s why we use those for it. The general theory is, that the market will, over time, price any asset according to it‘s current value. (It does not actually do that in many cases, for a variety of reasons, but that’s a different story) So in a way, a share is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it at any given time, this should, but doesn’t have to reflect the intrinsic value of the company it represents.",,
