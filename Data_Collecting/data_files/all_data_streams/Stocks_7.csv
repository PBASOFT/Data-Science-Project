One thing I'm curious about is how much the Pandemic effects on increase in business at select retailers will wear away. Large big box stores had an easier time adjusting to the shopping needs of the pandemic.

On the flip-side, the pandemic might have pushed both consumers and retailers to try new business models that will help counteract online e-commerce only companies.

People now know how to do curbside pick ups, in-store pick ups and retailers have learned how to handle more consumers doing that. This might give some retailers a quicker adjustment to new strategies to work with their own e-commerce operations or become more convenient option vs. competition from e-commerce only. In a way the pandemic pushed people into new strategies and some might last.",,

\- Lowe's is currently up \*50%\* from its \*preCOVID high\*. That is incredible and unprecedented. It went up, partially, because people expected them to have great earnings. The earnings aren't a surprise. If anything, not having stellar earnings would be a surprise.

\- Stocks do not only go up. Again, Lowe's (just to use your example) has gone up an incredible amount. Do you just expect it to keep going up forever? I think that's the unrealistic part that catches so many redditors. They don't look at the charts from the past 5 years. They just buy and think ""it's doing good, it'll go up."" Markets are forward looking. The question isn't ""how well did Lowe's do in Q1 2021"" it's ""how well will Lowe's do in the next year or two."" And maybe it'll do well! But is that enough to justify another huge increase? Who knows? Would you, personally, keep paying more and more for it right now? Because the ""price"" isn't some objective measure. It is the most recent amount that someone sold for and someone bought for.

\- The market definitely has problems. But if you think it's ""corruption"" that your stock isn't going up, I really don't think you understand what the stock market is. ""Price"" isn't something owed to you or your company. It is, again, something someone else decides they will pay for your asset. There's all kinds of ways someone would decide how much they want to pay for Lowe's after this earnings. Again, did you see the earnings and decide to double-down yourself? Because that's basically what you're hoping someone others will do right now.

I don't mean to be unnecessarily harsh. And, sure, there are shady things in the market. But posts like this just seem to say ""I don't know what the stock market is"" a lot more than ""the stock market is broken.""",,

Anyone know how to confirm how many shares of a public company and specific insider controls?",ngfuis,"How to find a insider's total Company ownership, MSTR and Saylor specifically?"

I realize it could crash at any moment, since its based upon SLV going up (its a covered call ETN) but I've been following both SLV and SLVO, and they feel manipulated. Also, they feel like they converge to each other. For example, SLV always dips after dividend is paid, but then it always dips a little more, than rises, so if you buy in the middle of the dividend period you will always see a rise in price. And... SLV seems to adjust to that rhythm. I'm under the impression it shouldn't do that, but since I'm new to investing, I'm just watching and learning.

I know you didn't ask, but if you're interested in the history of my portfolio.. Made 64k off of Palantir off of 30k. Cashed out and bought MRNA. Lost a quarter of my portfolio and had to wait a month for it to fully recover and then some. Bought so many meme stocks after that ""diversifying"" into about 30 different ones. Cashed out on a lot of them and then made significantly bad calls at the start of February by buying at the wrong time and basically losing 50% or more on these speculative stocks. Started swing trading like mad. Lost most of the trades, but the ones that I did win were in the 10s of thousands while my combined losses from swing trading was around 5k. And as of today I'm back at my highest point again for the fourth time mostly by luck.

It's a speculative space with a lot of competition. Also genomics is one that i had owned at points, but the consensus from research I've done is that genomics is still far away from being used practically. There is nothing wrong with owning these stocks now, but it's just not where the money will flow, and as a beginner investor, it can be very hard to watch your good stocks get hammered in times like these. 

I do believe that the things you've mentioned 100% have a future, but there are so many companies and stocks that just won't make it in those spaces, to invest in things like EV or solar or robotics, I would stick to ETFs until there are clear winners in the space, and then I would pick stocks based on those results. I understand your frustrations, but I've been in this game a while and timing isn't everything for the long, the last thing you want to do is try and time a bottom for a falling knife. I prefer to play those spaces safely, ex, instead of buying EV stocks that are overvalued still, buy the lithium miners, which will benefit from the entire movement. 

You're timeline is appropriate for what you hold, but many beginners that started in the past year have had a hard time learning the lessons that no matter the greatness of a company, the stock may not be priced correctly or have good investor sentiment based on the numbers and earnings. Also inflation is a very real risk to a lot of speculative companies. I was trying to give OP a safe way to play as to not dissuade him from playing the market if he were to pick speculative stocks and lose money. I know if you're long long term, it's less of a worry, but everybody says that until they're down 50% and don't know what to do. 

Sorry for the misunderstandings, I don't intend to argue. Everybodies timeline and investment styles are different, I just found that yours is riskier short to medium term and is probably not the best for a beginner, even though I have a feeling you are a beginner. The goal is to not lose money I thought, and that's the guidance I was trying to give to OP instead of, catch falling knives and wait 10 years for recoveries.

#Apple Inc


Ticker **$APPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 

The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 


At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.


With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.

But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher


This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.


An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 


Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 


While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 


This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.


This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 


Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 



**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards

I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes

TL;DR. APPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+). The range may be coming to an end.",ngga8k,APPLE INC. Technical Analysis Due Diligence

If you look far into the past you can see how the company reacted to recessions. If you see, that they didn't give the slightest shit that their stock price fell to the bottom of the recession and still paid out the same dividend five years ago, and then later you see it slightly rise, then that is a consistent dividend. 3-4% should be fine, if you see the dividend raise over time slowly, that means the % of gains you make on whatever you invested in will increase later also.

Perhaps when your stock collapses, as everyone sells off in a panic that armeggedon is near, you will remember the dividend stays consistent and reinvest where you will make a higher percentage yearly yield. If for no reason other than a stock market collapse, your company hasn't reported any significant losses, it collapses along with it, you wouldn't give the slightest fuck while everyone runs out of the building from an airstrike.",,

In general, you have to be careful about purchasing stocks with inflated P/E ratios, especially if they’re trading above a stock’s traditional P/E range. You can use a site like macrotrends to check this.

Even if a company is growing at an exceptional rate, you still need to look over their financial statements and attempt to identify the intrinsic fair value of the company today. There are a variety of methods you can employ to do this, with some being more involved than others.

In general, tech is still overvalued imo. However, my conviction and the degree depends entirely on the specific stock. If you could share a couple of the tickers you were looking for, maybe you can receive more focused advice.",,

The stock market opened deep in the red but managed to climb throughout the session to pare much of the losses. For example, the Nasdaq (QQQ) opened 1.73% down but managed to close the day 0.12% up. Despite the market declining modestly the last three days, it is encouraging to see volatility decreasing this week  after the wild swings the market experienced in the last few weeks. As said before, I thought the initial sell-off after the April Consumer Price Index was released was overblown for several reasons and am encouraged by this week’s price action.  

Leadership in equity markets has see-sawed between cyclical and value stocks and technology stocks, as market participants weigh the prospects for a strong economic rebound as the US economy continues to reopen with the possibility that the pick-up in activity may generate a surge in inflation. After leading the market higher in April, in the last month, the Nasdaq is down 4.77% compared to 0.79% down in the S&P 500. In my view, this dip could represent a great opportunity given earnings have been extremely strong and many companies have significantly raised guidance moving forward. 

The Federal Reserve released its April Meeting Minutes (basically a written record of what happened in the meeting), which said that “participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals” and reiterated, for like the millionth time, that they did not believe a near-term adjustment of monetary policy was needed. Much of the recent volatility in the market is due to investors afraid that a surge in inflation may cause the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy, so hopefully this commentary by the Fed can calm things down. [Read the entire meeting minutes here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210428.pdf)

However, it is important to note, the minutes covered the meeting before the release of the April Jobs Report, which came in much weaker than expected (which bolsters the Fed’s argument that employment remains far from their goal) and the Consumer Price Index, which showed a greater-than-expected increase in consumer prices. That said, the recent reports are extremely unlikely to change the Fed’s view given Powell and other monetary officials have said they expect any inflation to be “transitory” and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports before adjustments to the current policy are considered.

As the US economy reopens, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures “transitory”. In an April 28 meeting, Jerome Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.” 

Moreover, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” Finally, the April Job Report, which showed the economy gained only 266,000 jobs compared to the 1 million expected and marked a sharp deceleration in growth compared to March, bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

**Highlights**

* After declining in recent weeks, the sell-off in cryptocurrencies across the board intensified, with Bitcoin (BTC) falling below $40,000 after the People Bank of China (PBOC) doubled down on it’s stance and released a statement reiterating that digital tokens shouldn’t be used for transactions. The PBOC posted in their official WeChat account, “Virtual currencies should not and cannot be used in the market because they’re not real currencies”. It’s important to note the statement doesn’t have any new regulatory steps, according to Yu Lingqu, a vice director at the China Development Institute think-tank in Shenzhen. 
* Ford Motor (F) is expected to unveil an all-electric version of its bestselling F-150 pickup truck tonight
* The US dollar dipped on Tuesday for the fifth straight session, reaching its lowest level against a basket of currencies since late February on waning fears that inflation spikes could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than anticipated, another great sign that inflationary fears are overblown. 
* Nvidia (NVDA) is extending its cryptocurrency mining limits to newly manufactured GeForce RTX 3080, RTX 3070, and RTX 3060 Ti graphics cards. After nerfing the hash rates of the RTX 3060 for its launch in February, Nvidia is now starting to label new cards with a “Lite Hash Rate” or “LHR '' identifier to let potential customers know the cards will be restricted for mining. NVDA offers a separate, specialized mining processor that has the best performance for mining but will not be able to handle graphics. 
* In a Ford factory in Michigan, President Biden promoted his $174 billion plan to promote and accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles across the United States and planned to roll-back vehicle emission standards. According to the fact sheet, Biden's plan ""proposes cost-sharing grants to support new high capacity battery facilities in the United States” and backs grants to fund the retooling of shuttered factories ""to build advanced vehicles and parts.""
* Michael Burry, the investor famous for calling the 2008 housing market bubble and portrayed by Christian Bale in the movie “The Big Short”, recently unveiled a huge bearish bet on Tesla. Scion Asset Management, Burry’s firm, said in a regulatory filing it had put options on 800,100 shares of Tesla, as of the end of Quarter 1, a value of $534 million. Details on the strike price of the puts, their value and whether they are part of a broader trade are not publicly available.
* Interestingly, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) has sold nearly all of its Wells Fargo (WFC) stock, a position the company has held since 1989. In a regulatory filing on Monday, Berkshire said it owned just $26.4 million of shares of WFC as of March 31, down from around $32 billion in January 2018.
* **\*\*Please note that current stock price was written premarket and does not reflect intraday movement\*\***
* L Brands (LB) target raised by Barclays from $66 to $82 at Equal-Weight. Stock currently around $68
* Him & Hers Health (HIMS) target raised by Citigroup from $16 to $20 at Buy. Stock currently around $10.60

Bought the absolute bottom, sold the top of the first stimulus pump, then bought the bottom again a week later. Turned 15k into like 40k in like a month. Pretty darn proud of that. Made the stupid mistake of holding those longer than I should as they traded sideways for months costing me deeply in oppourtunity cost. After that I went balls deep into very aggressive swing trading on margin. Just so happened to do that a month before the vaccine announcement in October which meant like 50% profits in a month. Made tons off MA, SJM, LADR, AMZN, and NET. Bought a ton of HD and FB during the February corrections and would have made like 100k had I held those bad boys but I got impatient and only made like 15k I think(doubt I would have held that far anyways oh well). Almost lost my ass on ICLN and NET but my spidey sense was screaming at me to sell so I did. I did buy gee em ee at 16 and had I held that about a month I'd be a millionaire, but chickened out and lost 10k instead. Sucks to suck I guess lol. All in all my overly aggressive trading paid off handsomely, but now I want to preserve that wealth.

>If you don't mind me asking what are your plays or are you still trying to figure it out?

Currently all cash for the last month or two. Did some light trading for funsies the other day and made 2k but otherwise I dunno anymore. Cash is trash, but all my favorites have all run up, even the indexes. Were I to put my money in I'd say Visa/MA would be the safest bets while still being aggressive. They have by far the sexiest long term chart I've seen in terms of stable growth with enough volatility to make a profit swing trading, and I'm speculating their mix of growth and value ensures a sort of internal hedging regardless of how the economy goes, but what the hell do I know I'm not a macroeconomist. I'd love to buy AMD but every time I look at it that 50% runup that's practically a vertical line back in june 2020 really worries me, like it'll just collapse the second I buy it. Buuut it could also rocket up to 100 leaving me looking like a fool. A microcosm of my views on the market as a whole as of late.",,

What does this mean? It means that the future growth of the company is slowing down. So while the Price-per-unit of earnings (PE), is reasonable, the projected PE to Earnings Growth (PEG), that is, the relative price per unit of projected earnings is high.

You have top chip, tech and pharma companies killing sales yet falling while energy is going up while we are trying to kill the oil and natural gas market. Makes no sense. There is a worldwide chip shortage affecting almost every business in some fashion and chip makers are falling. They have such a chip shortage, companies are adding in 7-10 billion dollar add ons for more output and they still are sliding. Chip makers have more business than they can handle over the next 2 years. Green energy was booming and now it’s tanking. We are moving to green energy yet they are dropping every week. EV is the future and they have struggled to gain traction. It makes no financial sense. 
Here is my 2 cents on it and I’ve said it for a year. You have trillions going into alt investments  while also stale money is stuck in meme stocks to prove a point to suits. You can’t mention the alt investments or mods remove your comment. This is money that would be flowing through the market that isn’t any longer.

 *them. 8th earnings in a row it has smashed, and today it's down.*   
*Literally, you have a company coining it in, and the share price is*   
*dropping*

Weeding out paperhanded bitches who have so much money they never have to actually step foot in a Lowes store to find out for themselves how much better in every way they are than Home Depot. It's really not hard to figure out, did you even check the short interest?

If stocks with $150B market caps are able to be manipulated like you think that is a problem with WAAAAAAY too many speculators vs actual investors. THAT is what you need to be concerned with, and that's an issue with the overall market right now, not any one particular ticker. I get the rant, but earnings plays are really low hanging fruit that any simp can do if they have about 45 minutes to listen to some overpaid prick talk on a shitty VOIP.

Do your own DD, which it seems like you did, and knew well enough to not step on a landmine setting itself up for a juicy short. So what if it some bullshit pharma company went up today? What if it goes down even harder tomorrow? Wouldn't you look silly ranting about things that go up on speculation today, and down for the same reason tomorrow?

If you don't understand casino market dynamics, the best bet is to not play. Of course isn't a casino, and anyone who tells you that is either a butthurt moron who buys mutual funds, or a liar trying to hustle you. Wall Street right now is a digital ghetto where hedge fund crackheads are chasing every gain they can because the free money supply is gone, they bought too much crack too high and sold it too low, and their dealer wants his money. Bubble crack is what happens when powder goes up, and they want that magic gain powder more than Bubba wants to suck gasoline out of a dry Colonial pipeline so his truck nutz go brrr. If they can step on some and sling it back for a few bucks, they'll do it with theta crew. Game theory, all the way down. Did you see what happened to AAPL right before it's stellar Q1 report? 10% down in power hour. Apple, the company that always goes up! Why? Why didn't it go 10% up? Because someone got called on GME...

Do you believe in the stock? Is it at a good price? Then buy it and forget about it! If it goes down buy more! It's full-court press hustle mode right now to get as much money out of retail as possible while throwing shade at nervous investors to make them flinch. Just like you said, earnings don't matter and that's the short term market outlook this year. Too much money fueling too much speculation. 2021 has a lot of smoldering embers after the brushfire of last year with massive amounts of money entering and moving toward gains gaining more gains. Lots of solid long term investment material is buried under massive short interest that couldn't be taken care of because the GME nuclear bomb got armed. If you are on the wrong side of that deal it's full-court press mode to rustle up enough cash to survive getting called. If you are smart enough to search out heavily shorted tickers with great DD and want to sit on them as investments, you'd be pretty damn smart right about now. I got a gold mine I've been watching with 1700% short interest that's gonna be melting ingots in Q4 and has 25% more gold than they originally thought, giving them a 10 year supply. And someone just wrote calls!

The market is massively overleveraged, every boring investment ticker is overpriced, and money isn't coming in because investors simply don't have any more money they can squeeze from the labor force, or are getting ready to buy the dip by riding the bond rocket. Bonds are going crazy, more than justified by the rate increase or speculation on further increases; same dynamics at play. Where is more money going to come from for stocks? Main Street is in the shitter and folks don't have money to support realistic P/E ratio gains as it is! Meanwhile those stocks are already massively overpriced anyway because of hedge funds hustling each other and stealing from low-info paperhanded retailers to keep pumping overvalued reserve holdings to justify getting more and more leverage to keep hustling smaller gains. It's a positive feedback cycle that can only end when something breaks down.

The crack game here worked until retail bought all the crack on a block and put it in the paper. Now the cops are discussing watching the streets, the powder supply got tightened, and hustlers suddenly can't afford to sling anymore. What happens when crackheads can't get their crack? They rob and steal whatever isn't nailed down to pay for crack. And if they can't pay the crack broker back for what they already sold or smoked? Someone gets a bullet to the face. Don't be the guy catching the bullet. When you hear the music stop, find the nearest chair and bludgeon anyone trying to take it from you.

The company blew earnings estimates by 39.25% but are coming off a technical breakdown to the 50 day that consolidated into earnings. 

If you look at the EPS revisions from TSE in their earnings call slide presentation from May 6th the estimated Adjusted EPS for 2021 are 9.12-10.14 vs. analysts are outdated and as low as $4, which they already made this year 🧐, and one gave a $10.04. Comparable companies trade around 10x, and TSE closed Friday at $67.75 and today at $69.39.

There’s more...TSE is 94.77% institutionally owned and 2.2% is insiders leaving a public float of basically 3% with total shares outstanding of 38.74m as of 5/3/21. That leaves about 1.16m shares float. Now here’s what I don’t understand but find very interesting...how can there be 928,500 shares short with 2.3 days to cover and only 1.16m float? Can someone explain this?Aside from this interesting point I like the stock; not stock advice. 

https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=TSE

TSE trades an average 10 day volume of 375.79k. 

This is not stock advice, but what it appears to me is that once the analysts get off their bums and do the math, the revisions will be HUGE and this stock might be worth $90/share range relative to 10x earnings. This is not stock advice. I would be interested if anyone can explain the short interest to float here. Either way TSE seems like a lagger in the space with strong operating leverage and strong eps.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Do yourself a favor now that COVID is coming to a close and drive around your neighborhood (ideally with someone else at the wheel) and look at the lines or lack thereof at the main stores you see. McDonalds, Cheesecake Factory, Starbucks etc.. 

Go to the malls and see which stores are packed with long lines, and which stores have tons of employees, empty space and no one inside. Notice how many employees are in each store per space and whether the employees are constantly busying with things or just goofing off.

Go into the supermarkets and see which products are running low on supplies and which stores have plenty of things left in stock that have not been sold at all. Check the expiration date to see how long they've had some of these things on their stores. Ask the employees inside which items have been hot and they keep selling out of.

What am I hinting at mainly? TRENDS. You don't need to pay a site or ask some ""expert"" for advice on this when it is so extremely easy to do yourself. This also goes for to a lesser extent certain video games and electronics as well. Go to Best Buy, Gamespot, if you live in an area with subways see what things people are excited and talking about. How long the lines are at makeup stores and for what products etc...


Whereas most growth stocks are purely going off potential (and the sector right now could not in a worse place momentum wise) VALUE and cyclical stocks are about to boom. And you can do the DD to see which ones are going to pop about 2-3 months now before their next earnings report.

I also stumbled upon Viacom back before the Archegos blowup on happenstance and sold it at a remarkably good profit all bc I was lucky to get it earlier than everyone having a CBS premium account.


My main point being: Sometimes the best DD is the one of YOU literally going outside your house or news cycle and looking for yourself.

The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting. Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, inducing fear and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines). This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.

Its closing below your trend line, but still closed above the 200 MA, and still has two strong support levels to blow through before going sub 100 (120 and 110) - What negative catalysts do you anticipate that send this down another 25%, through major support, and then the past even the psychological support which will happen at 100. Its just as likely we bounce off 120 and head back up as we do head down. We'll need an outside catalyst to decide which way this goes, and given the negative market we could get one, but again we still have two support levels to get through before your price target, I just don't see it. Instead of negative earnings or bad fundamentals, we could get good earnings and positive fundamentals.

The biggest question is if you think it's worth risking holding or not. If you sell, you will lose that initial investment and then you will have to reinvest elsewhere to get that money back.

Look into valuation multiples (Not P/E, more sophisticated ones that are less susceptible to 'game' - like EV/Rev., EV/EBITDA.. will be sector specific) & see how a company trades relative to true comps leading into earnings. So even if ones down, its compset could theoretically be more down -- this will give you an idea of how much is 'priced in' or also indicate relative over/under bought levels. 

At the end of the day the trickiest part to playing events is mainly in determining how many buyers of a specific sector has all their buying power already devoted to a stock in anticipation of earnings/events. For example, if everyone thinks earnings will be good and all investors buy in anticipation of it even with good earnings, a stock could drop bc who else is left to buy? Target/Lows/HD is a great example of this - Target's EV/Rev relative to its compset traded at a Z-score to them of <0.4 leading into earnings",,

If they are nothing but a bunch of $100 teenagers acting like moral crusaders, why would you even care? A bunch of teenagers with $100 isn't going to effect the market in anyway, even if they all bought the same exact stock.

Or is it what you really hate is retail investors whose pockets are varied from $10 to $100k, or more even, thing about retail, literally anyone can be retail. Rich and poor a like. But its mostly regular folks who make up the bulk of retail.

And their moral agenda shouldn't bother you still. Not unless your a part of a HF or something. Why would it? It an agenda against the mega rich who got there by using the regular and poor guy's money to do it. Note not  an agenda against the rich in general, just the ones who manipulate the market and in the past have used countless dirty and even illegal methods to make a profit at the regular guys expense.

So get it right, we aren't JUST teenagers, some are, most of us are millennials I imagine though, with a bunch of zoomers in their early 20s who aren't teenagers. But even then, if you actually think we are the ones hurting the market... I am sorry your so bitter, but maybe cheer on the ones fighting the people who most likely actually have screwed you out of more potential profits than you will ever know. 

Or better yet, go to r/superstonk and read some DD and educate yourself on the facts. Told to an ape by apes, instead of some massive corp whose stalk advice is bought and paid for to ensure you do not profit and they do. Learn the real enemy.

During the recovery, I learned that they hate higher interest rates. They also really hate inflation. They hate tech stocks when things they hate are happening (like inflation or interest rates). They hate high job numbers because economy is racing back, but also hate low job numbers because economy isn't racing back fast enough.

I understand most of that is connected, but what is the true catalyst of major selloffs in the tech industry? Fears of interest rate inceases? Is that their main fear and they're ready to sell at any potential hint at anything that could trigger rate increase?

Or is there something else they're scared of more than rates?

And is there an actual situation they like which encourages massive buying? Or is it just easier to short right now so hedge funds are pretending any little thing scares then but in reality the value of stocks are on the high side so they're riding them down before loading up and riding them back up?

This is so confusing.

My conclusion is that the common denominator here is faulty assumptions on the part of the Fed, SEC, ratings agencys and all analysts.  Namely, ""stocks go up"" mentality - in this case in the real estate market.
