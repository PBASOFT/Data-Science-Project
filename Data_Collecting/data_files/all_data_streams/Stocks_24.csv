I work for company that is part of large multinational conglomerate that owns many other companies in the same sector. Our parent company is listed on NYSE. However, it is considered low P/E and high dividend value stock that recently got quite expensive so I don't own any stocks of it. Also... knowing how things work from the inside... I actually don't really want to hold any shares of this company... At least not at the current price.

Regarding owning shares its no big deal. We get little training videos about how we are not supposed to trade on insider information and how we are not supposed to trade shares just before and after earnings but other than that, no problem, anyone can own company's shares and I don't think you need to declare anything to HR. Also, we have shares ownership programme where employees are allowed to buy company's share at a discount. I think it's buying shares at cheapest price that quarter or something like that. Didn't really look into it much.

Looking forward to hearing from other people.",nknzhl,People who work for publicly listed company. Do you own shares of company you work for?

I think that is another thing that NIO has to fight against. The lack of trust in Chinese products.

That sure makes it sound like you have little to no disposable income, and if that is the case you absolutely should not have your money tied up in any type of risky investments. 

If you are going to tie your money up in higher risk investments like the stock market you need to do your homework beforehand. It’s not impossible to do that from an app, but it’s considerably more difficult to research and analyze company finances on a 5” screen. 

“Investment” apps are not brokerages. If you are investing your money you need to invest with a proper brokerage. They all have apps as well if you feel like your best investment decisions are made on the go. People should not be asking “which app is the best for me to invest” they should be asking “which brokerage best suits my needs.” If someone does not understand the distinction then they have not done enough research to be investing. Apps such as Robinhood just proved that when they let a bunch of ignorant people get on their app and gave them margin to buy and extremely risky stock in an elaborate pump and dump and then get fucked over because they don’t have enough money to handle the transactions, which would not have been the case at a real brokerage. 

If people still don’t understand what happened and all they care about is how pretty the lines are then they should not be investing.",,

Low P/B ratio compared to competitors can sometimes mean bankruptcy risk. Other times, it’s actually a gold mine.

If they already are in the process of doing that, then the market just hasn’t reacted to it. You buy in cheap and others will FOMO in 6 months when their net margins get +10%.

Berkshire never split their main stock because they wanted their investor base to be small and high value - like institutions or high net worth individuals. They don't want it particularly liquid.

Tesla split their stock because they wanted a larger investor base and for it to be accessible to retail investors because they believed that institutions didn't believe in them. They wanted it very liquid.

NVidia's leadership clearly believes that at the current price and given the current trends that the stock is becoming less liquid because the price-per-share is trending out of the range that casual investors are willing to trade in, so they are splitting the stock to bring it back into the 100-200 range which will make it more liquid.

I commented on it but can't seem to find it. I went ahead and did my own analysis and definitely think it's undervalued at its current price. 

You can see my blog post [here](https://onlyalpha.substack.com/p/coinbase-coin-leading-the-way-in?r=gs5o7&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=email&utm_source=reddit), and if you like what you see, please consider subscribing (it's free) and get access to new ideas from me as they come.

From my analysis, we're looking at an potential +72% upside!

Summary of what I found:
-  Massive top-line growth and margin expansion will continue to pump out large amounts of cash to drive further customer acquisition and product innovation.

- The growth of crypto adoption globally, both on the retail level and institutional level will continue to fuel its member base within its digital ecosystem.

- New revenue-generating products in the near term and short-term will position Coinbase to become one of the biggest crypto financial services companies in the world.

- Interested investors will have to stomach the ebbs and flows of the crypto market as it slowly establishes its footing given the company’s direct exposure to the market.",nkqzbo,Coinbase (COIN) seriously undervalued

I am very good with tracking them and making sure to close out if it is unfavorable. A family emergency came about and I was unable to attend to my stocks for two days. I had 10 spy put credit spreads that went ITM at expiry and I was unable to close them out before expiration due to said emergency. A took a net loss of 1000 bucks (which in the grand scheme of things isn’t the worst case scenario but still sucks). 

Two days later, I look at my TD Ameritrade account and it exercised the short and long leg to cover. Because it exercised basically 1000 shares of spy, it shows up as $420,000 cost and $419,000 proceeds. This equals out to 1000 dollar loss. I obviously did not put up that much capital.

Or will this 420k somehow skew my taxes and mess with my tax bracket at all? This has never happened to me and I am just trying to figure out if anyone else has had a similar situation. Thanks for the help and advice!",nkrho8,Taxes- Is gain/loss the only thing that really matters when filing?

yes. You average down on your most trusted stocks. It might look better  on paper that you averaged down and sold at -15%, but dollars wise you actually lost and spent more money that way than cutting loss at -20%.

Just imagine it like a huge chain of dominos. That said, this is very unlikely and requires more than just buying shares - though that is also not necessary by miles.

Considering the shares dropped to below 15$ there are probably a ton of people that are looking right now at a 80-100% profit and can sell at any time. Once sold you have a large volume and if shorts were interested to cover, then they can. There is nothing spectacular about this. Also the borrow rates are not set in stone, not per broker and especially not per customer. Also considering the moving amount is 16M a day, that's less than 3 days to cover on average movement, but this is also an illusion. If one covers the shares that were borrowed go back at expense of the buyer and the millions of shares can be bought by the next large short seller.

I always work out outside, and I'm a very active, very healthy person. Lots of my friends are the same. We all make fun of people who use things like Peloton products.

• Investing: I love dividend stocks (can share the ones I hold if you want), as when dividends are reinvested, it results in compound growth
- management, previous track record especially if there’s a change in the board
- amount of cash they have as it’s something they’ll always be able to rely on
- P/E and P/S ratios
- dividend payout ratio (ratio of the dividend to net income, as it means less money is reinvested into the company)
- I also own a few ETFs that I count on holding until retirement and also count on reinvesting received dividends

Trading: got burnt a lot over Feb and March, more stressful and overall time consuming so don’t recommend
- catalysts such as earnings and positive news about their performance or something coming up (be an early mover, don’t follow if it’s already up 100% in 3 months)
- growth potential and addressable market as well as future outlook - if you get caught holding the bag (like FUBO, SKLZ, NIO, PLUG, etc.) you can turn it into a long term investment

Advice I've gotten has said to buy into the market piece by piece, slowly over time and I've been following it. When it comes to selling I've assumed I'd just sell everything I had in a stock once it went up enough but then I thought ""well what if I sell it off piece by piece"". Specifically I have a +$150 return on 22nd Century Group Inc so I sold $130 worth of it. I figure if it continues to climb sure I'll make a bit less money but if it crashes (which I don't think is likely but you never know) I'll lose less and if it dips but looks like it'll come back up I can use the money from the sale to buy more. I know that sounds like I'm trying to time the market which is foolish but this is motivated more by wanting to actually secure the money I make from my investments rather then watch the money number go up only for it to drop like a rock before I actually get any of it out.

 It's a common mistake even experienced investors mistake. I've made it. I guarantee half the people on here who ridicule others for it, have done it. Millionaires have gone bankrupt through bad investments. It isn't just retail traders and lower/middle class who suffer from it. 

Like a lot of people, I used to say I never invest more than I can afford. I believed it because I wasn't looking at the whole of my financial situation and was ignoring major red flags. It's easy to tell yourself you aren't making such a ""rookie"" mistake while ignoring red flags.  If this might be you, consider simple signs you need to pullback:

- you are constantly watching price fluctuations and agonizing over dips. This happens because you can't afford to lose what you've put in which means you've put too much in. If you're losing too much time during your day watching stock prices and your job isn't a day trader than you need to lower your investment.

- panic selling at even a small loss. Nothing wrong with putting a stop loss in place but if you're putting one in for a small percent drop, chances are you're terrified of losing more than you can afford. Cut down your stake and you'll find you're able to weather the dips long term

- thinking about your investment as ""money you have"" to boost your confidence in your bank account. If you have $2k in your checking account but tell yourself it's OK because you have $10k in stocks, you are way in over your head. 

Here are some tips I've learned along the way that might help some others:

1. Don't beat yourself up too much or lose too much sleep when you realize you're in a hole. Its fixable and with mitigation, you'll be able to climb back out.

2. DON'T double down and try to recoup losses by putting more money you can't afford in. 

3. If you've put in too much and lost a lot, hold past the dip and sell once the stock has recovered to a safe degree. It's extremely rare for a stock to do a permanent  downward slump. Panic selling at the bottom screws you more. If a 50% drop happens and you've lost faith in the stock, wait until it comes up 25% to sell. This obviously is difficult to predict and modular depending on the stock and loss but unless a company is rumored to be going under entirely, you can wait for the buoy.

4. Just because you aren't losing money doesn't mean you aren't over-investing. Even if you're seeing gains but you're living paycheck to paycheck, you are over-invested. Stocks aren't a substitute for a savings account or as a holding place for all your extra funds. Its easy to placate out of that thinking when the going is good but that's how people get royally screwed. Even if it hurts, sell what you need to in order to get right financially. You might see fewer gains but you'll sleep better st night 

5. Make a gated checkpoint system of what you invest. For example, 20% of your paycheck goes into savings. 30% of your monthly savings account goes into investments. Find a number thats safe for you.

6. Last but not least, always imagine your investment is a vacation. A lot of people say ""assume it's money down the drain,"" but I disagree with this from a psychological standpoint. If you're active in trading, it's hard to simply view the money as gone. Imagine you're planning a vacation and the money you're putting in is what you're spending. You obviously want a nice vacation but no one spends their life savings on a vacation (unless you're dying in which case go nuts). Some vacations end up being worth the money and some end up a disappointment, but you don't ruin your financial life by taking a vacation and buying stocks should be no different.

The news in Q1 was mostly about how industrial companies in materials, construction, agriculture, rail, mining, etc. are going to continue to rebound well until about Q4 because of the pandemic recovery, and big tech (NASDAQ) is going to plateau during that time.

The news lately has been mostly about continuous monitoring of the impact of inflation and oil prices on stock prices.

Investors seem to have either sold in May and gone away, or they are watching the Q1 news stories play out now, and don’t really have much more to say about the markets.

Margin is the epitome of investing more than you can afford. Unless you know exactly what you are doing or do this as a full time job, relying on margin to finance your investments is a red flag.

I maintain a zero permanent margin policy. I will use it to buy stuff when bank transfers are not quick enough to transfer the cash needed, but I always pay it off 100% within a day or two. Relying on margin permanently and getting used to the securities you buy *as your own* is a mistake.

Its a single video game... yes the business model is very interesting and i am sure it does nicely, but 50.721B for a video game is a lot.


By comparison, Activision is a whole bunch of highly successful games which earns far more money, and they're only worth 75.021B.



I think Roblox is very overvalued.



In pure numbers, activision made 8.09 billion USD in 2020, and roblox made $920 million.


Additionally as a gamer, i think even the most successful games rarely last forever. A game still played 20 games years later is a miracle, and the revenue is usually down by a lot, no matter how great it is.


Just my opinion tho, i haven't actually played roblox itself but its hard to imagine it being more than a trend.",,
