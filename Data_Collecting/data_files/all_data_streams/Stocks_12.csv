At this point, given your history your seeing ALL of your failures and absolutely none of your successes. I'd say given your setbacks and where you came from; landing a six figure salary is a HUGE win-win. 

As to the investment strategy I can't really help there. I'm sorry. I too am in a tough spot, where indexing probably isn't going to do me much good. I'm a bit over 50 and disable-y retired. So far, I've not lost any money and can even boast of some small gains, but nowhere near the SICK GAINS some of these folks have shown, But I also know I don't have the risk tolerance nor the money to take risky bets. All I can do is keep trying and invest in companies I believe in; backed of course by those companies that are profitable. 

Initially, I was hugely disappointed by my returns, especially watching all these meme stocks become high fliers while the stocks I chose were either stagnant or had little gains. I started to question what I was doing wrong. And still do. But when things started to change in the market the companies that I had chosen handled all the negativity in the market much better than the high flyers. 

I have also noted the stock market is like a huge game. The media is used to create fear, doubt, and any other kind of negative emotion to make one question his/her market picks. All I can do is continue to learn, not take any huge risks, and KEEP trying. 

Maybe try just dipping your toes back in; instead of trying to just get Right back to it.

Experiment and see what works and what doesn't. Readjust and continue to move forward. 

The only reason I responded was not to give financial or market advice because I have None, but to possibly help you see that Not everything you've done has been a failure.

With that said I love their new EV line. The Mustang looks sweet and the GT premium performs 0-60 in 3.5 seconds selling in the $60s. The Taycan 4S does 3.9 seconds STARTING at $110K. Audi E-Tron GT does it in 3.1 seconds starting at $100K. 

The F-150 looks fantastic and starts at $58K. Similar to the Cybertruck pricing and compared to the hummer $110K it seems like a steal. 

They are bringing a higher performing electric vehicle that a lot more people can afford. I hope it continues and if successful they could be the leading manufacturer of electric vehicles in the US soon. 

I think a price point of $15 or so with a market cap of $58 billion seems reasonable to me over the next year or so. Maybe it does hit that $20 if actually the leader in the US in a couple years. Not crazy.

But often and especially in this weird post-corona market, companies' performance don't seem to have the exact correlation to their stock performance, with many companies overbloated in price with future expectations priced-in.  

As a stock,, Volkswagen's (Vz, not St) forward P/E right now is 7.5. Tesla is at 127 and Nio isn't even poised to make a profit apparently. Comparing P/S ratio, Nio is at 11.77, Tesla is at 15.1, and Volkswagen is at 0.53.    

If Volkswagen and Herbert Deiss can implement their plans of becoming a fully top-down tech-first auto company with everything in-house (and being in the industry I have some idea of how serious VW is at not being dependent on literally anyone especially for their software and services, as they see that as the key differentiator in an electric era), the revaluation of the stock price alone should make up a large portion the growth I'm looking for.

I have 5 shares of Arclight (ACTC) and received an email from Schwab with the above title. In the proposal, it says "" Shareholders of ArcLight Clean Transition Corp. (ArcLight) have an option to redeem their ordinary shares for cash at an approximate per-share price of $10.00."" It also says ""The offer provides shareholders an opportunity to redeem their ordinary shares for a pro-rata portion of the funds available in the Trust Account established in connection with the Initial Public Offering of ArcLight.""

What does this mean? Why would I sell my shares for $10 when they're trading publicly for $16.65? I'm very confused.

Thank you! The email was very long, so if you need more information for context let me know.",nhc086,Notice of Corporate Action - ARCLIGHT CLEAN TRANSIT F

I can't name it here, but one stock fell from like $60 to $30 overnight, and then continued to fall to under $20. People woke up one morning and were really pissed their stops didn't trigger.

F sells a lot of cars. Thus, their focus isnt necessarily more sales, its margins and it will take very little change in margin, to move the bar. 

The reason for that is their margins are historically thin. But that also means that even a slight improvement, of say 2-3% in net, would push the stock to double if they can just maintain that for a couple of years. This is all they need to do. So the question you need to ask is will eV's increase margins? And if so, by how much?

Historically, ICE margins are very small and most companies today are lucky to see 5%. So a change of 2-3% is huge. See what I mean? Its not like a startup which has to show 30%-50% rev growth for 10 years straight.

I think the switch to eV's will definitely increase margins. At first it will be slight but the margins will grow every year for the next decade and they will grow by a lot, to the tune of maybe 1% per year as sales increase. I also think that due to Fords legacy in trucks, they will be able to command a premium to everyone else thanks to 3rd party support, ease of repair, and low cost of ownership. 

I also think that in time, fleets management software will indeed become a major thing. As we move more and more to online shopping, efficient delivery will become insanely critical as Amazon has pointed out time and time again. Thus there will be enterprise software profits to be made for those that have a lot of vehicles in the enterprise space... which is likely going to be Ford though Rivian currently has a nice path with Amazon specifically right now. But Ford owns a bug chunk of Rivian too so lol.",,

To quote my favorite fictional animated scientist (who was quoting my favorite animated scientist's sidekick) ""that just sounds like slavery with extra steps"".  Now, hardcore fundamental investors will have issues investing in companies that show no intention of paying a dividend, because that is truly how profits are returned to ownership of a public company. 

Which, and let's open another can of worms, is why a lot of people, myself included, have issues with corporations using their cash generated from operations on stock buybacks.   The reason boards and executives do this is to increase the value of their own stock options or argue treasury shares to award themselves at a later time.   

When a Company buys its own stock on the open market, it drives the price of the shares up.   Now, you might say ""that's good for owners"", but only if they sale.  If the shares are either awarded out later or used to fulfill exercised stock options, then there is no net effect for owners who held throughout that period.  If, instead, the Company pays a dividend with the money it would have used for the buy back, all owners benefit equitably.  

Here in lies the heart of what makes wallstreet a crooked game.   It doesn't do what it's ment to do anymore,  pay ownership it's share of net income.   The companies that pay regular dividends are far and few between and are pretty much just the dinosaurs of the blue chip echelon.  

Few companies started in the last 50 years would ever consider using their cash in that way.   It's stupid, why pay all the little people that often this company when the boards and executives can pay themselves instead.",,

>Now let‚Äôs say it goes up to $700 way before January. How much profit do you make?

A lot. It's impossible to calculate cause it matters when it happens, how quickly it happens, and how much above 700. But yes, if you buy a 590C today and tsla skyrockets to 700 by next month, you'll make a decent amount of profit.

> Do you lose more the closer it gets?

Yes, this is called theta decay. Think of it as how likely it is for a call to reach the strike. If you have a 590 strike for tomorrow and another for jan of 2022, theta will decay much faster for tomorrow's call cause it's much less likely to hit 590 vs hitting 590 in jan 2022.


> Also is the break even price exactly how it sounds? So if it‚Äôs $697 break even, I would only profit after $697?

The breakeven is a misleading statistic because it only matters on day of expiration. If your b/e is 697, it means on day of expiration, if tesla is below 697, you'll lose money on your initial purchase. however, tesla can be at 697 way before your call expires and you'll make a profit.",,

A bunch of the VW evs were the same way but they started to get the picture and went out and developed a custom EV frame so I'm holding out hope with them.

Fords strategy is not new in the EV world.  They just happen to be doing it with a pickup truck.  They've probably learned a few lessons from the others which may make their product marginally better but the premise is still there.  

You are going to have a very tough time making an EV from the frame of an ICE vehicle.   Especially when you try to start adding the same computer electronics that Tesla has.  It just doesn't fit in the same frame.

My original plan was to try and get my net worth up by utilizing my own more aggressive ITM LEAPS plays, then after 1-2 years, move my money over to someone like that so that I could generate more meaningful returns based on the larger portfolio size.

I bought into the local electric company and Ford, because I was sure that Electric Vehicles were going to be huge, and make me money. Welp. My Ford stock is still under water and I keep it as a reminder. Yes, there is such a thing as being too far ahead of the game. I've also learned to sell the cycles with 'cyclical stocks' such as automotive and oil. They go up 100%, then eventually go back down 50% (to the same price where you bought in) then they go back up. Holding long-term can get you absolutely nothing over the long term. And there is no reason you need to sell 100% of your shares in any company. Not a bad idea to keep some shares, maybe 5-25%. I sold out of AAPL, AMZN, PCLN etc. back when they were almost penny stocks. Sure, I sold out of some companies before they went bankrupt, but you can only lose 100% of your position. The maximum you can gain is technically infinity, but for the stocks mentioned, we'll say 10,000+%. And you can always write off your losses on your taxes, which means you lower your tax bill (or another way to look at it: too didn't truly lose 100% on that bankrupt company, because it allows you to write a smaller check to the government)",,

I think this is a huge deal for Ford which is going to force other manufacturers to produce full size pickups near this price point. Considering the average full size gas powered pickups start at around 40, this could be a game changer.",,

And yet GM has had poor styling for many years and continues to have a loyal fan base, especially on the truck side. So I don't personally disagree on the vehicle appeal at all... but somehow GM remains the volume leader among US automakers. So the proof is in the data that at least their customers like what they are making.

From a management bench, GM has a strong leadership team, led by Mary Barra who's been in that chair for 7 years and is doing a great job. They had a smart CFO that was snapped up by Stripe. BTW I personally believe pre-bailout GM was not a well run company, but the leadership brought in during the auto-bailout fundamentally changed GM for the better.

They made smart investments (Cruze), exited struggling brands (Pontiac, Saturn), exited markets that weren't working well (Europe), and entered new growth markets (China). Today's GM isn't the old one. 

Ford on the other hand still has heavy family influence in who leads and the direction of the company (Bill Ford is Exec Chairman). Frankly that influence isn't great from an outcomes standpoint. They terminated several CEOs who were very effective (Nasser, Fields). They hired (IMHO) a totally unqualified person to be CEO (Hackett). Now they have yet another CEO who has only been in the chair for 6 months. Yes they have big plans now - but the last guy also had big plans. To me the execution - outside of Alan Mullaly- has not been great. They invested in Chariot, and shut it down - but what were the learnings and next moves? There are other data points.

Then look at the stock returns for GM and Ford. On a 5 year return, Ford is -5%. GM is +82%. The market story says it all. Confidence in what GM is doing and lack thereof for Ford. I dumped my Ford shares shortly after Hackett took over and I don't regret it for a second.

788,,2021-05-21 01:49:39,t3_nhh78w,,stocks,"Investment Thesis for Daily Journal (DJCO)

Introduction:  The Daily Journal is viewed by the general public as a dying newspaper business.  It is a dying newspaper business, but the Daily Journal has pivoted itself to a SaaS business, but is trading at a valuation far below most other publicly traded Saas businesses.  We will investigate why the Daily Journal is a worthwhile investment at its current valuation.

Management:  Normally, we‚Äôd begin by looking at the business, but management within the Daily Journal is incredibly strong, so this will be our beginning.  The Chairman of the Board in Charlie Munger, Vice-Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway.  He bought the Daily Journal in 1977 for $2 million dollars and has been the Chairman ever since.  The lesser known name leading the Daily Journal is Gerald Salzman.  He joined the Daily Journal in 1986 as their President, CEO, CFO, Treasurer.  As such, there is likely no one else who knows the Daily Journal as well as Gerald Salzman.  As an added bonus to the quality of the two men leading the Daily Journal, their executive compensation is almost unheard of.  The Board of Directors receive a payment of either $5000 or $0.  Gerald Salzman, the CEO, receives a salary of $250,000.  These are acceptable salaries due to the large amount of insider ownership within the Daily Journal.

The Business:  The Daily Journal has three business segments, 1) The Daily Journal Newspaper, 2) Equity Investments, and 3) Journal Technologies.

---

The Daily Journal Newspaper is a series of mostly California based legal newspapers.  Their revenue comes from advertising from display advertising (i.e. traditional advertising found in most newspapers), classified advertising, trustee notice sale advertising, legal notice advertising, and circulation advertising.  The sad but unfortunate truth for investors is that this portion of their business is worth very little.  The good news, however, is that most investors outside of the Daily Journal are not interested in investing in a dying newspaper and thus has led to the undervaluation of the Daily Journal.

I won‚Äôt spend any more time on this segment except to say that the newspaper‚Äôs most successful year isemi-modern history was during 2008 due to an extreme uptick in the need for legal advertising relating to the foreclosure of many homes.  It is possible that if another recession strikes, the newspaper business of the Daily Journal could provide some financial cushion to keep the Daily Journal in strong health.

---

Equities have been a growing proportion of the Daily Journal‚Äôs intrinsic value.  Charlie Munger‚Äôs investing prowess that has benefited Berkshire is also at work within the Daily Journal.  We have insight into the Daily Journal‚Äôs American investments thanks to their most recent 13F filing, which was released within the last week.  At this time, the Daily Journal holds $197 million worth of American equities, mostly concentrated in financial services similarly to the holdings of Berkshire Hathaway.  Another notable holding is a new and growing position in Alibaba.  

While it is not explicitly confirmed, there is a VERY strong evidence that the Daily Journal also holds a sizable position in BYD, a Hong Kong traded electric car manufacturer.  This would not appear in its 13F filings, so its size cannot be confirmed, however we can make an educated guess.  The exact value of his BYD investment is unknown, however it is assumed to be be roughly $140 million.  In the most recent filing, the Daily Journal notes that it sold $20 million of one of its positions to reinvest into another security.  The suspicion is that this was a shift from BYD to BABA.  As such, we will value the BYD position at $120, though in truth, it may be slightly higher as BYD traded at a fewer dollars higher of a valuation prior to the most recent filing.  Nonetheless, we will assume its value is $120 million.  This brings the Daily Journal‚Äôs equity portfolio to a value of $317 million.

The Daily Journal also has $27 million in cash according to their latest annual report and they hold some office buildings in Los Angeles and in Utah which THEY value at $16.5 million.  I emphasized that they value the building because, as I‚Äôll discuss below, the company has some questionable accounting practices.  In the instance of the office buildings in Los Angeles as an example, they valued the buildings at $16.5 million roughly 20 years ago and that figure has never been adjusted.  The result is that they are likely undervaluing the true value of their real estate holdings.  If we increase the value of these holding to $30 million, which seems like a fair appraisal for their buildings based on current market rate, this results in a total equity and asset value of $374 million.

Their liabilities consist of ~$60 million in deferred capital gains (0% interest), a $29.5 million margin loan (3% interest), and a $1.5 million mortgage (4% interest).  The deferred capital gains will not be paid anytime soon as Charlie Munger likes to hold stocks and when he sells, typically he will move into another qualified investment.  The margin loan was used to acquire businesses to build the Saas business and is serviced by the dividends from the bank stocks in the equity portfolio.  The mortgage is self explanatory.  Total liabilities amount to $91 million

Before jumping into the last portion of the Daily Journal‚Äôs business segment, I want to note that the Daily Journal has a market cap of $414 million.  As such, to reach its market cap valuation, assuming no value is assigned to the legal newspaper business (it has a value, it‚Äôs just not a high value and in all honesty, I don‚Äôt know what a fair value is for that business), the Journal Technologies business only needs to be worth $131 million to come a fair market value at its current market cap valuation.

---

Journal Technologies is the hidden gem of the Daily Journal.  It is a legal Saas business being sold to municipalities via the RFP process.  It is a case management system built off of a central e-Suites product that is then configured to meet the client‚Äôs needs.

It has a unique business model that results in, once again, an undervaluation of the company.  After being awarded an RFP, the company will then define the scope of the product, establish servers on site, and install its product, and then configure it to the clients needs.  All of this work takes 4 to 8 years to complete and during this time, the municipality is not billed.  On a relevant note to the questionable accounting practices above, the Daily Journal does not report the forthcoming revenue on its financial statements, thus these contracts have not necessarily been taken into account to determine the Daily Journal‚Äôs current market valuation.

When its e-Suites product goes live, the Daily Journal will charge an implementation fee and subsequently bill a licensing fee for the next 10 years (with built in price adjustments to account for inflation).  Currently, Daily Journal has over $100 million in forthcoming revenue which, due to their billing practices, is a very high-margin revenue once billing starts.  These contracts are found in the USA, Australia, Canada, and Tasmania currently, though more may have been signed and not discovered.  Credit to Matthew Peterson for taking the time to search across the web looking for tenders awarded to the Daily Journal, as there is not a central repository to identify these contracts.

Moving forward, the assumption is that the Daily Journal will continue onboarding new jurisdictions, there will be an increase in licenses purchased for existing contracts after e-Suites launches, consulting fees for upgrades and modifications will increase, and other e-solutions will be integrated with e-Suites to increase revenue (such as e-payment for fines and tickets).

While the Journal Technologies already has $30-some million in revenue, this figure will increase with time.  Additionally, these municipalities will likely continue using the e-Suite services once they go live after the time and cost of configuration, meaning revenue that is on the books today is revenue that will be on the books likely after the 10 years of licensing has expired.  Presently, Journal Technologies is a $200-$300 million business based on the figures and assumptions above.  Under this assumption, the Daily Journal is valued somewhere between $483 million and $583 million, meaning it is currently undervalued by 17% to 41%.

---

There are a few risks that need to be mentioned.  One is liquidity.  The Daily Journal has a $400 million dollar market cap and is too small for many large financial institutions to monitor.  It also has a $300 share price which, while irrelevant to value, will scare away many newer retail investors who invest $20 to $50 at a time.  Beyond these two issues, the Daily Journal has quite a bit of insider ownership or is owned by firms with long-term visions, thus they are not willing to sell shares on a daily basis.  The result is that only about 5,000 shares are traded on a daily basis.  This means that if you need to liquidate your position in a pinch, you may have to sell below the market rate.

The other glaring issue is age.  Charlie Munger is 97 years old and Gerald Salzman is 80 years old.  Beyond not being at the forefront of technological innovation on a personal level (some may view this as an issue when running a Saas business, personally I am not concerned as there job is to manage the people driving the Saas business), their old age means that in the coming years, their leadership may cease to exist.  No clear succession plan has been identified (this was raised during their last annual meeting by a concerned shareholder).  As management is a key strength within this business, this could be reason for pause for prospective shareholders.

Lastly, there is the $16 billion elephant in the room.  Tyler Technologies is their key competitor.  There are other smaller competitors who offer more limited solutions, but Tyler Technologies is the real competition in this space.  While their products are more modern and (likely) have better and flashier features, this is not necessarily what wins in RFP processes.  Instead, the Daily Journal‚Äôs practice of not charging the client until launch is a much more appealing catch for prospective clients.  While I‚Äôm sure Tyler Technologies will be a fine company in the long-term, its hard to argue that their fundamentals are nearly as attractive as the fundamentals of the Daily Journal.  The Daily Journal is valued at 8x sales, has a P/B of under 2, and has a P/E of 3.5.  By comparison, Tyler Technologies has a P/B of 8, is valued at 14x sales, and has a P/E of 91.  Tyler Technologies would need to continue growing at a very rapid pace to be a strong value investment (note that Tyler Technologies is still rapidly growing, though this rapid growth is slowing).  By comparison, the Daily Journal, if it continues at its current growth, is already a great investment.  As most clients are onboarded, growth is increasing and it is my belief that this will be a phenomenal investment.

An earlier update on Oct. 23, 2020, added information about a price increase for FSD to $10,000 and that the company had started releasing a significant FSD update to limited owners in ""beta"" form.

Standard disclaimer, I'm not a financial guy at all and I eat crayons or what not.  
My thesis:  
Roughly last decade or so, under Hackett, Ford executives realized a few things.  
1) Too many platforms = rollout is slow, design cycles too long.  
2) Too many loss making platforms = High ASP Customer moved from compact cars to SUVs.  
3) Other traditional automakers are ahead of them in EV transition. The Bolt, the Prius, the Mirai.  
So the strategy is this:  
1) Consolidate platforms : Faster factory retooling to adjust to market demands, better supply chain control  
2) Remove bad products  
3) Invest in Electrification.  
4) Keep market share in which they are already a leader in. That's Ford Transit (best selling commercial van) and F150. Both are among the first ford EVs (Outside of the mach-E, which they actually purchase the motors and etc, so it's closer to assembling a car, rather than designing it). The F150 lightning will have a motor that is designed in house, and probably cost less to build that to buy.  
More:   
All of these are not regular day to day decisions. These are all company shakeup level reorganization and rethinking from the top down. This is basically Ford 2.0, or whatever version they are on right now. To use a historical valuation on this new ford company is going to be a bit difficult. They are probably at  the 30% to 50% mark in the reinvention of their company so we might soon see them reap profits.  
Further out:  
When the E-transit hit the shelves, they will have more emission room to push their traditional line up in europe a little more. The Mustangs were selling a lot higher than it has to today because of the emissions. The mustang also has a huge cult following in the EU as it does in the U.S, it is not an easy feat as there are lots of amazing competition from across the pond.  
However,  
That said, the execution still needs to be improved. The Explorer launch in 2019 was poorly handled.  
The lack of new models hurt Ford sales in APAC, until the new mustang mach-e came in, they had many quarters of declining sales in China, which is the largest growing auto market and second largest auto market.   
There is risk associated with their justifiably huge debt in the ford credit arm (they take on loans to let their customers borrow against). Rising interest rate for example, could hurt their profitability in the long run.  
I hope they don't fumble with the F150 lightning, or it would be another long decade.   
TLDR: If I treat Ford as an entirely new company with no history of their successes or failings, I'd buy this stock at a lot higher price. There are risks to it, but at this current price point I'm cautiously optimistic",,

>Its time and energy could be better spent on developing a driver monitoring system for Autopilot to significantly improve the safety and usefulness of that system.

No. Just no. Cameras on the driver isn't going to make their systems ""safer"" or more ""useful"".

For all the situations that FSD is advertised to be used in, and many that it isn't, their systems do an A+ job at both piloting the vehicle and alerting the driver to take over when the AI isn't confident what to do.

Auto-Steer and Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, often referred to together as Autopilot, can't drive _everywhere_, but the number situations they can handle extremely well is impressive. Freeways have been a solved problem for Tesla for years. Lane changes, also solved for freeways and city streets. Stop signs, street lights, construction zones, speed limit signs, all solved with vision -- the car will come to a complete stop at a stop sign without intervention, or would slow down and alert the driver when entering a construction zone. Even roads with poor or no lane markings are handled quite well. If the car isn't confident, it prompts the driver to take over. It's a PHENOMENAL system.

Only uniformed people who hear ""Autopilot"" and jump to the conclusion that it should be able to take you from A to B without intervention complain. Nobody is claiming that it does that. It's a driver _assist_ system, it's not a replacement for a driver.

I've heard ""news"" reports of driverless crashes or of someone riding in the backseat w/o a driver, and I call B.S. Nobody is stupid enough to believe that is safe to do today. It's a prank, someone is getting paid to give Tesla bad press, and risk their life in the process. You can't get to your destination from the backseat, at best it would get off a freeway and stop in the off-ramp and wait for the driver to accelerate. If you're circumventing all the seatbelt checks, hand on wheel checks, seat sensor checks with special tools and claiming that a reasonable person would do all that and then climb over the seats without opening doors and think that what they are doing is remotely safe, you're straight up trolling.

Tesla should continue improving their AI vision based diver assist systems, because it's already a revolutionary product and it continues to improve month by month.",,

I started around 2008 when interest rate dropped from 5% to near zero. So my high yield savings account makes nothing anymore. 

First trade was BS - BearsStern after JPM announced the take over at 10 per share. Second trade was LEH. If you don‚Äôt know history then you‚Äôll have to go find that ticket. 

I started tracking since 1/1/2009. Since then I averaged 8.18% a year. But the portfolio value as a whole about 30% a year. 

Up until 2014 I was an ‚Äúexpert stock picker‚Äù. By expert I mean I have nothing better to do that watch and read market news blogs etc. everyday I got my Schwab trading platform up on my second screen picking the next big stock. I was relatively flat and way underperforming a simple SPY(VOO). After 2014 I stopped looking and went 90% funds and ETFs. I had to because I started working for a real investment firm and I need to preclear all my stock trades. For my 10% stocks...I do semi annual rebalance to buy or sell. That has greatly helped the performance compared to when I was actively trading. 


Mistakes I learned: 
* don‚Äôt trust business news when they make recommendations. The experts that makes them don‚Äôt actually always believe it. Sometimes the show producer ask if they can make a case. 
* we always end up holding losers longer than we should and sell winners earlier than we should. - new rule 50% loss triggers an exit. Winners stay until the signals goes negative  
* figuring out how much to buy is just as hard - I started applying a risk control to the stocks.  I would split 10,000 to 4 sectors. Then buy them based on market cap. So large cap gets a higher weight within my 25,000 sector. 

How I am handling the recent drops? I sleep like a baby. I never experienced a drop larger than 4% on a given day. Even on the worst days....well that 4% is a 0.4% hit on my total portfolio. The rest of my assets are nicely allocated globally and across different asset classes.",,

Hi all,

I am looking forward to opening a position on Amazon but I still have a tiny small doubt in my mind, I am wondering if posting my doubt here can help me clear it or better understand it.

The doubt I have is that wouldn't reopening cause a decrease of deliveries on [amazon.com](https://amazon.com/)? [amazon.com](https://amazon.com/) seems to be hot last year because people don't want to go to stores to buy stuff but once the store opens, wouldn't the traffic of [amazon.com](https://amazon.com/) go down? Also, since people are at home more, AWS was getting a lot more traffic from their popular clients such as Netflix. But once the economy reopens, people won't stay at home as much and therefore not go on to AWS-hosted websites as much, right? Other services such as Twitch and Amazon Prime should have lower traffic too because of people spending less time at homes. The only few services I think of might benefit are Whole Foods and IMDb.com.

But somehow, analysts seem very bullish on Amazon's short-term. I am seeing a bunch of $4000-$5000 price targets. Why are analysts giving such high price targets when so much of Amazon's revenue depends on the environment of staying at home?

Thanks for sharing your thoughts!",nhiyel,How will reopening affect Amazon?
