A new junior mining company currently in the prospecting stage, Stevens Gold came across my screen recently. Strong management and don't see how the team will lead it anywhere but up from here. Starting fresh with discretion to do it right the first time.

Charles Malette as the President and CEO with 35 years as an investment advisor. John Mirko as a Director with 40 years of experience in the mining industry directly and was a part of a large acquisition in the past to a company with $172 million in 2017. James Bordian as CFO with 40 years experience as an accountant, holding senior positions at Air Canada and US Plywood.

The brains here at the company are fantastic, very early on, great opportunity to grab a large chunk for value. Love the gold/silver mining space and where its headed in the current economic climate. With a market cap just under 4M you can't get much better than that.

These individuals are priming the company to have liftoff depending on drill results on their property. Very early into life here, good chance of getting in before it becomes more expensive.

Recently they began to survey parts of the property across 213 identified locations. Results will be shared as they come in. The property has been sampled before in the past in 1998, but Stevens is looking for something more modern and up-to-date. Those samples had:

* 158.5 meters in length averaging 0.97 g/t gold and 5.7 g/t silver.
* 140.2 meters in length averaging 1.12 g/t gold and 5.7 g/t silver.
* Seems to be an average of 1.5 - g g/t gold around meters for other samples as well.

Strong but still need to wait for current results. Hopefully even better.

Stay safe, this is not financial advice!!",nlplpn,Stevens Gold. Waiting for drill results. History shows it strong

Their houses are not in desirable areas and their value didnt increase that much even with the recent inflation. Also, not many people in the service industry own houses anyways - which was the industry hit the hardest. The foreclosure process will put many houses on the market, but they will be bought up by investors very quickly. Also, If you check zillow (which i did every day for a year), there are always houses in preforeclosure and foreclosure. I think foreclosures will cause prices to flatline, but not cause a significant dent in the market. 

At least, thats what i tell myself since i just bought a house at what i consider the height of inflation.

110,,2021-05-24 23:04:55,t3_nkayq9,,StockMarket,"Momentum is building in the Renewable Energy and Vanadium Electrolyte industry, faster than ever before. Vanadium Electrolyte, VRFB technology & Steel Manufacturing is the hottest trend of 2021 that shows no signs of slowing down.

Let me explain why.

Vanadium is holding a strong necessity due to the increased demand in the Steel Industry, forcing China (the leading vanadium producers) to become a net importer.

As for Vanadium Electrolyte, this 'gold dust' is going to play the most important role for VRFB efficiency. The mineral has proven to last 25+ years in a Redox Flow Battery, whilst performing 4/5 charge cycles a day, this blows the Lithium Battery out the park.

Vanadium Electrolyte can be recycled and replaced with additional Vanadium Electrolyte after the 25+ year lifecycle is up to perform a further 25+ years. Proving to be an effective, environmentally friendly and a competitive replacement to the traditional Lithium Battery Storage.

The Renewable Energy goal is to keep an energy efficient system sustainable. In present times the typical Energy Storage solution has a Lithium battery storing the energy to release when in demand.
Lithium Batteries are not sustainable enough.

The performance of lithium batteries decreases due to its limited charge cycles becoming a 'bottleneck' to the sustainable solution, just like your mobile phone battery worsens after a year of use.
Not to mention the flammable risk factor.

Doesn't sound very sustainable.

This is where the space of VRFB technology for Energy Storage is born. Vanadium is a popular candidate to be used in a Redox Flow Battery. Proving itself, sustainable, effecting and efficient due to its unlimited charge cycles, in comparison to a Lithium Battery.

With how Bushveld Minerals (BMN) positioned themselves with the largest untapped Vanadium Reserves in the world, an Electrolyte Plant due to start construction later this year whilst partnered with the South African Government, alongside VRFB devopment funding, not to mention their 25.5% holding in Enerox. BMN holds a very strong campaign to provide an excellent return Long Term.

Bushveld Minerals - A Vanadium Mining company with an Electrolyte Plant due to start construction later this year and South African Government backing, that also has a goal of becoming a Vertically Integrated business. The future looks extremely bright for Bushveld Minerals",nkayq9,Vanadium & Vanadium Electrolyte - BMN

Covid-19 pandemic started around the same time causing a labor shortage which compounded the issue of lumber production. Then, the FED lowered rates to as low as anyone has seen to help the economy. Well, locking in all time low interest rates to build a house is keeping demand going for people buying homes but the lumber production hasn't caught up to demand.

Also, it doesn't matter how high the price of homes are. It won't offset a liquidation if no one is buying cause prices are too high. People won't buy at higher levels if they cannot afford it even if prices are ""inflated by big banks."" So that logic doesn't check out.

It would be easier and safer for banks to not take on excess risk than to prop up the market prices to theoretically absorb a price shock.",,

165,,2021-05-26 20:53:17,t3_nlr818,,StockMarket,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, May 26, 2021**

Stocks mostly consolidated today, finishing modestly higher led by a 0.34% gain in the Nasdaq (QQQ). After the volatility experienced in the first weeks of May it is very encouraging to see market volatility calming down and holding on to recent gains. Market participants continue to closely monitor incoming inflation data, though it seems fears that the Federal Reserve will be forced to tighten monetary policy have tempered.

New economic data released yesterday shows consumer confidence dipped in April, compared to March, even as more social distancing restrictions were lifted across the US. The Conference Board (a non-profit research organization), released their April Consumer Confidence index which showed sentiment falling steeper than expected. The report showed the consumer confidence index dipped to 117.2 in May from 117.5 in April. However, on the positive side, April's reading was the highest since February 2020, before the start of Covid-19 lockdowns. Economists expected consumer confidence to rise to 119.5. 

Yesterday, members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), reiterated their stance that they were not yet concerned that new inflation data would force the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be ‚Äúmostly temporary‚Äù and that the Fed was ‚Äúnot quite there yet‚Äù when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be ‚Äúoverly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.‚Äù 

Richard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, also said ‚Äúthere will come a time in upcoming meetings‚Äù when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that ‚Äúit is going to depend on the flow of data‚Äù. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.

This reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldn‚Äôt worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, ‚ÄúWe will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.‚Äù

**Highlights** 

* Great  vaccination numbers coming out in the US. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United States has administered 289,212,304 doses of COVID-19 vaccines in the country as of Wednesday morning and distributed 359,849,035 doses. 165,074,907 people had received at least one dose, while 131,850,089 people are fully vaccinated as of Wednesday morning.

It‚Äôs very exciting and provides so many opportunities for high-quality storytelling ""

An Inverse ETF is the opposite. As the market starts declining, or doing really bad. These inverse ETF's will rise in value and make more money for it's holders.

Redfin CEO (Real estate listing site) with some insights. 

> Inventory is down 37% year over year to a record low. The typical home sells in 17 days, a record low. Home prices are up a record amount, 24% year over year, to a record high. And still homes sell on average for 1.7% higher than the asking price, another record.

> But in two of America‚Äôs largest cities, inventory has increased, in New York by 28%, in San Francisco by 77%. San Francisco hasn‚Äôt had an inventory increase this large since 2008. And still in both markets, prices are increasing.

> In 2020, new-construction permits were *down* 13% in DC and New York, 40% in LA, 48% in Chicago, 50% in Seattle, 79% in San Francisco. Permits were *up* 25% in Miami, 56% in Vegas, 96% in Greenville, 122% in Detroit, 246% in Knoxville.

> Lumber prices are up 300%.

> In Redfin‚Äôs annual survey of nearly 2,000 homebuyers, 63% reported having bid on a home they hadn‚Äôt seen in person.

> For low-tax states, 4 people move in for every 1 who leaves. For Texas, this ratio is 5:1; for Florida, 7:1. Cites & states have no leverage to raise taxes, after many promised new money for social justice; the federal government will have to fund long-term investments.

> The average housing budget for out-of-towners moving to Nashville was $720K, ~50% higher than locals‚Äô $485K budget. It used to be coastal elites who worried that every adult in the family had to win a career lottery, just to afford a home. Now that feeling may spread.

> it‚Äôs not just income that‚Äôs k-shaped, but mobility. 90% of people earning $100,000+ per year expect to be able to work virtually, compared to 10% of those earning $40,000 or less per year. The folks who need low-cost housing the most have the least flexibility to move.

Everything in this post is complete tin foil hat hot garbage.  Both posts are factually wrong and also just idiotic.

House prices in various places have dropped plenty of times in the past.

Plenty of places saw house prices continue to appreciate even during the depths of the financial crisis.

""banks"" and ""institutions"" don't prop public markets up without participating in them.  So unless banks and these mystery institutions are going out to the markets and literally buying out supply and then sitting on it, which would be very obvious, it's a literal non statement.

The current price of construction materials is due to:

1) COVID closures restricting supply of building materials

2) COVID causing a noticeable pause at the beginning of the pandemic in housing markets, both new and resale

3) In the US, tariffs, because you guys don't make enough wood and have to prop up your failing domestic suppliers who charge too much for wood so you try to restrict supply from the top through tariffs.  Your shit costs more because sellers have to pass the tariffs on to your consumers if they buy cheaper outside lumber, or you have to pay more to your free market domestic supply that will raise prices when supply gets thin.

4) Now that a good % of the population who was already in a position to buy a home has been sitting at home not spending any other money, they're coming to the realization that they want to have more space to WFH so they're upsizing.  Or they just have lots more in the bank and want to build an addition.  Or they want to buy a rental and renovate.  Or they want to just build a vacation home.

Housing starts are fucking through the roof, try finding someone to build you a house right now.

If it was so easy to do this, why didn't the banks do the same thing in 2008 then?  They didn't, because this isn't a fucking thing.

From what I understand the Fed is going to let inflation rise above their 2% target because they've specified they're shooting for a 2% average.  This leaves room for inflation to run higher than that 3-4% over a year or two before the Fed will feel pressured to raise interest rates.  The economy is going to run HOT in a world with higher inflation (which would still be low compared to historic highs) and low interest rates.  Seems to me like the bubble pop is far from here.

Our market signals changed to an uptrend yesterday, making today the 2nd day of the new short-term uptrend. Your advantage in the markets lays during stock market uptrends for simple reasons. Since most stocks are increasing in price during this period, your chances of profits significantly raises when buying.

Keep in mind that the market usually has a trend ""trend."" And what this indicates is that there are certain times you should not buy stocks, and certain times you should. As in the art of war, Play the game on your terms, and try not to gamble. 

Now, market uptrends tend to give the unaware a false sense of ""security"" or ""expertise"" for the lack of a better word. I guarantee you if you close your eyes and throw darts at 10 stocks in the S&P 500 or NASDAQ, the chances of you being profitable are very high during this time frame. 

The trick is seeing the approaching correction and keeping ahead with your stop-losses to sell you out, but when the time comes, the guidance will be there.

With that said, the market condition could change at any time, but you would typically see the change coming when paying attention and tracking the trend every day.

So, Happy Trading, and GET THOSE GAINS! lol

273,,2021-05-26 22:07:20,t3_nlsrq9,,StockMarket,"Netflix was founded in 1997 as a website for renting DVDs. Remember those things? Today, Netflix is the largest video streaming service by subscriber count. Netflix generated $25B of subscription revenue in 2020 from four separate regions: North America 45%, Europe Middle East Africa 33%, Latin America 12%, and Asia Pacific 10%. 

Netflix faces increasing competition from other streaming platforms and traditional media providers. Streaming services, like Amazon Prime (AMZN), Disney+ (DIS), and Apple‚Äôs (AAPL) recently launched service, provide ad-free, on-demand content, similar to Netflix. Other streaming services such as Fubo TV (FUBO) and Hulu, provide access to live TV and sports without a cable subscription. Traditional media companies, like ABC, Showtime, and CBS are making their content available through their streaming apps on platforms like Roku (ROKU) and Apple TV (AAPL). Netflix arguably sparked the phenomenon of cord-cutting, driving subscribers of cable companies like Comcast (CMCSA) and Charter Communications (CHTR) to disconnect their cable TV service while keeping their internet service to stream Netflix. 

Netflix is led by its Founder and co-CEO Reed Hastings. In July of last year, Netflix appointed Ted Sarandos to co-CEO, who has been with the company since 1999.

Fun Fact: The average cable subscription costs over $55, compared to Netflix at $11.56!

What the BULLS üêÇ say: Netflix is a leading distributor of content and has had great success with large investments in original content like House of Cards and Stranger Things. Last year, 37% of subscriber viewing time was spent on original content, compared to just 17% back in 2017. Netflix makes up 8% of global video view time, so there is still plenty of room to grow market share. Haters have been sounding the alarm on coming competition for years, but Netflix has proven them wrong time and again.

What the BEARS üêª say: The competition is finally here! It took Netflix a decade to reach 100 million subscribers. Disney+ did it in 16 months! Unlike Netflix, platforms like Paramount+, Disney+, and HBO Max have pre-existing books of content they can leverage for subscriber growth. Netflix is forced to spend heavily on producing or acquiring the same quality of content to catch up. Recent media industry consolidation has created some media powers that pose a significant threat.

294,gzkicg6,2021-05-26 22:23:30,t1_gzkicg6,t1_gzkfv67,StockMarket,"Again, I question the claim that the entire economy is so entrenched in making money off low interest rates that rising interest rates would for one, halt all borrowing, and would two, crash the entire economy.  I'm totally with you that small pockets of the market that rely on low interest rates to boost implicit returns on investment will suffer from rising interest rates, but that's limited to only some sectors.  Maybe stay out of aggressive growth stocks in the near future.  I'd wager that the more established FAANG stocks though won't even fall victim to a rise in interest rates because they essentially short treasuries by holding so much cash.  A large bulk of the economy though may thrive in a higher inflation world.  More money reaching the wallets of people and being passed around and making its way up the food chain in profits will serve the economy better than money being pumped into asset prices.  If anything I'm confident that we'll see a lowering in P/E as corporate profits rise which will bolster more confidence in the stock market to accomodate more growth.  

The 4.2% figure is mostly a symptom of base effects, and that is just one data point, so it's unfair to claim that's what inflation is ""currently at"".  We'll have to see where we are in a year, as an artificial bump in inflation may be a short lived symptom of reopening imbalances in supply and demand.",,

As a rule, I don't believe in conspiracies or collusion at this level, there would just be too many people involved and someone would talk about it.  It wouldn't be an online suspicion, it would be a poorly kept secret with smoking gun level evidence.

Also if anyone is manipulating the real estate market it is the network of agents with their secret information pumping prices higher.  That industry needs reform.  They keep secret information on recent sales, and the bidding process is completely opaque.  All the have to do is hype the shit out of it in the media to create the perception that it's red hot and then when your agent tells you that you need to bid 10, 20, 30 or more over ask you just curse the market and do it.  There might be two or three bids on a house and all the buyers' agents are telling them the same thing.

Google GATC Health news and take 15 mins to read what this company is doing in the Genomic AI Sequencing space. They are looking to go public later this year on NASDAQ or NYSE and approaching its REG A+ stage estimated at a significantly higher price possible in the next forthcoming weeks. Do yourself the favor and read the articles/contracts/partnerships this company is doing. Currently, the shares are $3.75/share to allocate before it goes into its Reg A+. Get into a company that is undervalued and at the ground floor but way past the conceptual phase. The company will get a 2nd evaluation when the Reg A+ approaches. Reach out to me if you want to lock in those shares or want more details, investors will be having a very blessed 2022 once it's listed on nasdaq or nyse.

387,,2021-05-26 23:21:04,t3_nlua4c,,StockMarket,"As I posted before, **you will** get a cash payout of $2.53 per share for each Hertz share you own. That is not in question.

Plus, and here is where the confusion is, you will get 1.04 Stock warrants for each share you currently own. Each warrant is good for buying 1 share of the reorganized Hertz for $10.

So, **what is a warrant** and **what is the warrant worth**?

**The warrant is** the right to purchase a share of a company at a designated strike price. So even if Hertz is trading at $15 a share, you would have the right to purchase a share at $10.

**The warrants worth is** market determined. You can choose to do 1 of two things (for this example, we will use $15 as the current price at which the new reorganized Hertz is trading):

**1)** Exercise the warrant - buy the share for the $10 and for this example you would instantly increase your position to from the $10 you spent to the $15 current trade price.

**2)** Sell the warrant - you can sell\\trade the warrant just like any option. The only difference is that you would instantly receive a cash distribution. You would essentially sell you warrants for $5 per warrant. The new owner would now own the right to exercise, and you will receive the cash difference to the current market price.

**Example (the one used by the investor group that is purchasing HTGQ):**

So, in this case the total value of the HTZGQ stock is the $2.53 cash plus the $5 warrant value. Which totals $7.53 on a stock that is currently trading at $6. That is a 25% ROI in 3 weeks if you invested today.

There is the possibility that the new reorganized shares will trade at less than $13.50 a share. Which would mean $2.53 plus 3.50 or less. Total of $6.03 or less. Which would mean you would only break even or lose money at today‚Äôs price of $6.

**Here is where I insert that I am not a professional financial advisor, and you should consult yours before investing.** *My belief is this.... Hertz traded in the* ***$20-$40*** *range for the 5 years prior to the pandemic. It had shaky financials for years leading up to the stress test of the pandemic and their failure. But now it has a reduced debt structure and a hot rental market. I must believe that the new Hertz will trade at the same or higher than its previously debt burdened self.*

I think the shares of the reorganized Hertz land in the mid $20's the first day of trading. if this happens 1 share will be worth $2.53 + $10 = $12.53. So, at today‚Äôs price of $6, you would see a 200%+ return in 3 weeks.

399,gzkqg5a,2021-05-26 23:27:49,t1_gzkqg5a,t3_nlmktd,StockMarket,"One thing I can speak to is that the banking industry is indeed fearful of the current housing market.  I've heard bankers openly speculate about what will happen 2-3 years from now once the market has cooled from being red hot and the people buying now go to put their homes back on the market.  

One thing you may not be aware of is that it is becoming just accepted that in order to win a bid on a home you need to put in a price about 10-20% over asking.  This is happening on almost every home sold right now.  These houses are not being appraised for this amount and the banks are forcing waivers on home buyers that they will be responsible for this amount in any event. 

As for manipulating the lumber market to control inventory, if that was their plan, they are not doing a good job.  Homebuilding has not slowed down significantly at all in my area.  It is a gold rush for the big residential developers right now.  Really only your small custom homebuilders are being affected by the lumber prices.  

The market is so hot that residential developers are building without contract right now.  This is extremely unprecedented.  The standard is for homes to be built under contract to limit risk to the developer.  But the contracts are actually a risk to the developers right now with the rising lumber prices.  They do not want to be tied to a price that will be less than their costs at the end of contract if lumber continues to shoot up.  So they are building their most efficient, profitable home models en masse, then when they are nearing completion and know their final costs, they will put the house on the market with a healthy mark-up. They too are still receiving bids over asking for these homes.  

This market is wild and no one I've talked to has ever seen anything like it, even before 2008.  It's a hard argument to say there isn't a bubble here, but at the same time the Fed pumped like dozens of trillions into the markets.   It's entirely likely that this is just the new normal with the doubled up money supply.  

There are also other reasons for lumber to be shooting up, and no it's not people all running out to Home Depot... I think that is honestly a simple explanation that only explains a very small part of the price.  I think the biggest issue is incentive changes in the timber industry itself.  Namely fuel pellets and how they encourage the growth and harvest of immature pulp wood, making it more profitable than growing mature lumber and pole timbers.",,

448,,2021-05-27 00:04:09,t3_nlv3a1,,StockMarket,"Background: ENKS (Enerkon Solar International) is a solar and hydrogen company with business worldwide. I've been following the stock since late last year when it was $0.05/share. It had an intrinsic value of around $0.40 at the time. It first jumped up to $0.50 (1000% gain), it gradually fell back to $0.20 some weeks later and then jump up to $2.50+ (another 1000%+ gain). It has gradually fell back to around $0.30-$0.40 range once again.

Revenue and income have been increasing year-over-year. In Q1 of 2021, the intrinsic value of this stock increased from $0.40 to $0.60. At today's price of $0.34, this would already be a 2x bagger.

BIG NEWS: Last week, the company announced plans to up-list to NASDAQ. In order to do this, they need to inflate the share price to $4.00/share, which is the minimum requirement to get listed. The company agreed to buy the CEO's 25 million shares in order to reduce the Outstanding Shares by 30%. *This is a ""non-cash, non-debt conversion"" to preferred shares, so as not to disrupt the cashflow and book value and hurt the shareholder.* This has already been completed and brings the intrinsic book value per share (that I calculate) to around $1.00. The company/CEO says a reverse split is out of the question (not good for the shareholder, nor the price), so they plan on continued buybacks, including buybacks of the common shares (reducing the Float) if necessary, with the first round being completed by the end of this week or early next week. That is just the FIRST round.

Here is the link to the news explaining all of that: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/enerkon-solar-international-inc-enks-123000774.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/enerkon-solar-international-inc-enks-123000774.html)

They have hired 2 companies to perform audits, which should be finished within 8-12 weeks, part of the requirement process of officially getting listed on NASDAQ.

&#x200B;

Outstanding Shares: \~ 45M

Float: 15 Million

Market Cap: \~ $15M

**Current intrinsic value: \~ $1.00 / share**

Current price: $0.34 / share

**Free Cash Available: $17.4M**

&#x200B;

Apparently, there is some kind of 1-day technical delay in getting the official share count number updated online, but it will be roughly a 25M reduction, not including the first round of buybacks happening in the next day or two. So I'm unsure of the exact outstanding share count number. However, the 15M float is certain.

They have more cash available than the current market cap, so I believe the plan is to use that cash for buybacks in order to force the share price to minimum $4.00 for the NASDAQ listing.

So that means 10-12x bagger at a minimum. Once it's on NASDAQ, it will probably go much higher. The fact that this stock has already gone to $2.00 (and made two 1,000%+ runs twice in the last 6 months) - without any kind of buyback news, let alone permanent retirement of 30% of the Outstanding Shares, just makes this awesome. It's also got the ""Biden / Renewable Energy"" factor as well, if you want to count that.

&#x200B;

Disclosure: This is the strongest and most undervalued stock on my list, I've been watching it for many months now - even before the buyback and NASDAQ listing news and their plan to increase the share price to $4.00 using means that preserve shareholder value. I bought around $250,000 worth of this stock, easiest, no-brainer 10x-30x bagger I can think of. 

Given that this stock is grossly undervalued, I own shares at prices far below it's bare-minimum intrinsic value, and many other value investors have also found ENKS to be at the top of their research list as well, I'm feeling pretty safe with this stock.",nlv3a1,"ENKS - Undervalued, Profitable - 30% of O.

Everything you said about tariffs is true, but there is more to the story. There is currently a pinch point of supply at the mill level. There‚Äôs been a gradual draw down of the number of mills across the US for some time, but on top of that some mills reduced production during covid for a couple reasons, but namely because they were actually anticipating a *reduction* in demand. I couldn‚Äôt defend why, but this is the talk around some of the forestry folk I work around.

They were very very incorrect, and increasing production at mills is not a super easy process. It carries marked risk should demand suddenly fall away; which is part of the historical nature of the boom and bust cycle in the timber industry. Should they get caught with their pants down, so-to-speak, history suggests they risk their entire companies going under. 

TL;DR boom and bust cycles are time-honored parts of the timber industry and mills get hesitant to heavily invest in production should demand inevitably collapse.",,

The Hedgies have much deeper pockets and much less scruples. Additionally, much less funds are required to lower the price of (short) a stock through options than it takes to raise the price.

Few people, save the 0.001%, actually have the amount of money necessary to combat the level of naked shorting across the board and I don't see any of them stepping up to the plate.

In the movie, ""The Big Short,"" Mr. Burry tried to warn certain people of the market housing crash - and no one listened.

Mr. Burry, we apes are watching, listening - at least I am. I hope you are wrong, because if you are right (again) the widespread despair will be unfathomable. However, I also understand that to bet against you is not a bet to be taken lightly.

I‚Äôm talking about people who couldn‚Äôt graduate high school or have spent their adult lives barely scraping by on dead end jobs. It would be absolutely wonderful if these people were simply steadily putting money into broad based ETFs and growing their wealth over the long term, but they aren‚Äôt.

Electric winged aircraft are going to revitalize small urban and suburban airports. Right now they're highly restricted because people don't want the noise of a lot of air traffic. A regular electric winged airplane, not a hovering one, will be quiet enough to be acceptable to those communities. Also, they don't require fuel handling, and the hourly flight cost is less than a quarter of the cost of flying a non-electric airplane. They're also much safer because there's almost nothing to go wrong with electric motors.

There are a lot of companies working on electric airplanes at this time. Some have already fallen by the wayside, I think they've been waiting on solid state battery technology that's been slower to develop than expected. But now it seems almost definite that there will be a lot of solid state batteries available by 2025.

Currently that little plane, the Alpha Electro, can only be in the air for 90 minutes, which means it's limited to 60 minutes because you have to maintain a reserve of 30 minutes (actually 45 minutes at night). If you could double the energy density of your batteries, then you could stay up for 120 minutes, which gives 90 minutes of flying.

Once you're flying with electric motors though, you can power them with any energy source. So you could have a gas powered generator on board to power the motors in the middle of your flight, and only use the batteries at the beginning and end.",,

Dr. Michael Burry is best known for predicting the 2008 housing crash, depicted in the 2015 movie The Big Short. The most recent 13-F filing for Burry's Scion Capital shows he was short over $500 million in Tesla, and $170 million in long-term Treasuries via options at Q1 end.  
**Why is Michael Burry Short Tesla?**  
Scion Capital's recent 13-F filings contained a surprising revelation ‚Äì the fund is short hundreds of millions of dollars‚Äô worth of Tesla stock (TSLA) via put options. Scion's founder, Dr. Michael Burry, has criticized Tesla‚Äôs insane valuation in the past, but now he appears to be upping the ante and betting a significant portion of his fund that Tesla shares will fall sharply. It's clear that Tesla's stock valuation, after going up to over a $600 billion market cap in 2020, is not in any way justifiable by its underlying business. Wall Street sharks drove up the price to hustle billions of dollars from S&P 500 index funds. They knew that index funds would be forced to buy Tesla shares from them, when Tesla (at the time the largest US company not in the S&P 500) was eventually selected for inclusion in the index (and the higher they drove the stock, the more the index fund managers would have to pay). Scion's SEC filing also revealed large put option positions against long-term Treasuries (TLT).  
**Why is Michael Burry Short Treasury Bonds?**  
Dr. Burry's second-largest position is a short bet against the iShares 20+ Year Treasury ETF (TLT). The bet against Tesla seems highly risky. By comparison, shorting Treasuries seems like a no-brainer. The Yield on the 10-year Treasury note started the year at 0.93 percent per year (current Yield on U.S. 10 Year Treasury 1.57%). This is well below the 2.79% yield on the 10-year Treasury note in 2019. Especially since the Fed has said that they will let inflation run much higher than their target of 2.00%, so the market expects a jump in inflation. Burry specifically shorted the long end of the yield curve, which has greater downside, if yields continue to rise. Burry is cleaning up here again, with Treasury yields moving to the upside by a landslide and Treasury prices falling.",,

We‚Äôd be able to calculate the true SI then by the ‚Äúestimated float‚Äù of course it won‚Äôt be 100% bcs not everyone voted. But they‚Äôre reporting a 20% SI. If it‚Äôs way more than that with votes, we‚Äôd know they committed a ‚Äúcrime‚Äù. So we should know soon. I think they have an incentive to lie about this. If they reported the true numbers, you‚Äôd have too many people jumping on this (more than now), and they don‚Äôt want that. It‚Äôs easy to just pay a $50mil fine compared to $10billion in returned shares to cover or more. These guys have deep pockets, let‚Äôs see how deep!",,

We go into a short hard lockdown for a few days letting health department contract trace, then back to normal.   

Covid has affected me all of 2 wks at the start with a hard lockdown, then 2 x 3 day lock-downs...... And I got paid $750\wk for 12mths for the inconvenience.  

No masks at all in my state for months. Economy is BOOMING, at least in my sector (construction). I've got a business and can't keep up with the work! Money is literally everywhere! Government is supposed to be moving to a national infrastructure investment spend and if that happens the economy will go into hyperdrive here. 

Yeah, its pretty tough here right now, send thoughts and prayers!",,

A few complained about a small business who wasn‚Äôt enforcing masks and got him shut down. During hunting season they just shoot any deer, fawn or any animal at that rate because they are so greedy. They shot a local man‚Äôs goat because they are that cognitively impaired. I have seen them joy riding poor areas for footage to add to their YouTube channel or Instagram. I have seen them just walk right in a barn while milking as if they own the place. They truly disturb me as humans. Then they come and claim that they are helping business and we shouldn‚Äôt complain...yea",,
