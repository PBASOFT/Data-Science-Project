2,gz0jamf,2021-05-22 02:23:09,t1_gz0jamf,t1_gyyxzqa,stocks,"I've had Tesla for 3+ years and have bought since January. Tesla is notoriously volatile and if you aren't able to handle 30% swings then don't invest. It's really that simple. 

People blame the stocks, market rotations and any short term media induced noise instead of taking a step back and realizing you are investing for the long term and that means patience. 

Practical advice is make sure you actually understand the risk and volatility of your portfolio. Most would fail here because we think we know until things go to shit and then you're freaking out. There's a reason over half of my portfolio is in index funds. Not because I think they'll provide a higher return (yes I know this is debatable) but mainly because I don't want 5% daily swings. 

If you make mistakes, welcome to investing and an otherwise teachable moment. Learn from it and move on.",,

The two that are doing badly are one I bought stupidly and another I‚Äôll hold on to..
One that‚Äôs doing badly is Tesco a U.K. supermarket I bought because people convinced me it was a no lose after the special dividend and a consolidation well let me tell you that went shitty and I‚Äôm 10% down where I was before... I‚Äôll get a 4% div this year and I don‚Äôt mind just collecting that going forward...

The other that isn‚Äôt doing great right now is due to my thesis, I went for the roaring twenties trade so I bought Ferrari. The kicker here is it wasn‚Äôt a bad trade, I bought Ferrari 6 shares at 211.65 sell price is 211.19.. I know I should be down what? 2.64$ nothing to complain about, the problem here is that I‚Äôm as you may have guessed U.K. based so I‚Äôm actually 30¬£ down due to the strengthening of the pound to the dollar... 
the same can be true of Pfizer 44 shares at 37.31 .. it‚Äôs now 39.94.. not a bad swing right... except due to currency fluctuations that only equates to profit of 13.91¬£ whereas in dollar terms it would look more like 110$

Hydrogen fuel cell manufacturers are a bit of a lottery ticket.

The historical arguement against hydrogen is that its inefficient to produce, but that's green/grey hydrogen. Blue hydrogen is what I love, not green hydrogen, and APD are making the move to that. Although I would love to see a move to green hydrogen in the future, Blue hydrogen is far more efficient, with essentially no pollution.

* very high mass density of energy.
* Electrolysis is simple and can help solve problems with unreliable renewable energy generation.

Cons of hydrogen compared to battery:

* low volumetric density of energy -- very difficult to store.
* Hydrogen distribution is pretty piss poor.
* Round trip efficiency of hydrogen is poor. Power -> hydrogen -> power loses a ton, especially if you add distribution costs and storage inefficiencies (compression or liquifying).
* Most cost effective way of generating hydrogen isn't electrolysis, it's using methane, which isn't exactly green. Also shows how inefficient electrolysis really is.
* Most efficient way of generating power is from fuel cells which require exotic metals, much more so than batteries (there is research on both sides done to minimize this cost).


The only way I see hydrogen ever being possibly feasible is if renewable energy becomes so successful, we need to find ways of dumping excess energy -- such that hydrogen becomes practically ""free"" except for electrolysis and distribution costs. Even then, I'm not sure.",,

The transaction will result in Redbox becoming a publicly traded company with an enterprise value of $693 million.

&#x200B;

The transaction, approved unanimously by the boards of both companies, is expected to close in the third quarter of 2021. At that point, Redbox‚Äôs common stock is expected to trade on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol ‚ÄúRDBX.‚Äù The transaction is being funded by a combination of $145 million of cash held in the trust account of Seaport Global Acquisition and a private investment in public equity (PIPE) commitment of $50 million led by Ophir Asset Management.

&#x200B;

After the deal closes, Redbox expects to have approximately $209 million in cash that will be used to pay down existing debt and fund digital expansion, content acquisition and marketing initiatives.

&#x200B;

According to Redbox, it generated $114 million of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) in 2020.

360,gz17wqj,2021-05-22 07:14:02,t1_gz17wqj,t3_ni16t3,stocks,"Here‚Äôs a few suggestions.

1) use bonds, etfs and a few ‚Äúboomer‚Äù stocks. 

2) if your stock or etf is trending up and it dips, this is usually hedge funds/MM stop loss hunting. Companies will sell. People will shit themselves, like yourself, and sell. Then those firms will buy back in. This is illegal in most cases but rarely enforced and usually the media will provide a scapegoat for those companies (I.e ‚Äúfears that the migrant caravan, causes S&P500 to drop 5% in the last week‚Äù) 

3) stop looking at your account every 5 seconds. 99% of the profit you‚Äôll make is through after hours trading and trends that you miss out on if you sell. Seriously. If you buy a stock without being 100% convinced that it‚Äôs a stock that‚Äôll go up, you‚Äôll sell if it drops 25%

4) ‚Äúnever‚Äù use leverage (I personally use a 2x leverage on a bunch of my trades and then use excess money to extend the Stoploss/margin call, but if you‚Äôre not certain or sure then don‚Äôt use leverage). 

5) don‚Äôt throw good money after bad. Just because a stock drops 25% in a month doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôll immediately rocket up again. Investing in consolidating stocks, deep or under valued plays and balancing that will stable stocks,bonds and etfs to maintain capital is better than chucking your savings at half a dozen sinking companies and praying that one of them does a 10 bagger.

6) your biggest focus should be on capital preservation, then making profit, then limiting losses. Keeping your position sizes to 7.5-5% or less and DCA (dollar cost averaging) into plays can help ease those dips and balance out your capital. Even tho lump sum investing does make more profit. Gradually investing in 1/4 chunks or 1/3 chunks means if a stock dips 10% you can still break even by investing your capital as it dips, then your positions you invested at a lower price can be compounded by selling at the point the stock breaks even and investing in another play/saving. Or holding if you feel like it.

7) if none of these appeal to you, just invest in VTI and VOO and stay away from the casino. The years you‚Äôll save on your life probably outweigh the profits you‚Äôll make trading. I‚Äôm not a boglehead but they seem happier üòÇ",,

I agree. We'll see how long it takes until Oatly is a true consumer's staple. Before that it's just a gamble on the far future that might turn out either way (or you keep the stocks for a shorter amount of time, as long as the growth prospects are still greater than for ""similar"" comps like Beyond etc).

I am also consuming oat milk since a few years (seems like a good base for Oatly and the likes if so many people like you and I are drinking it, eh?). I find there are differences in terms of taste - of course you have to pay a premium for Oatly compared to e.g. the store's own brand, so I went with them, but sadly they lack the creaminess and are rather bland (not nutty). There's only one brand that comes close to Oatly and they also produce a lot of other milk substitutes like cashew etc. But obviously subjective, just my two cents.

I bought some shares of a certain crip-toe (word filter is bs at times) and got worried, sold at a loss for 40 dollars but it was a very good lesson for me in terms of really figuring out what I'm doing and not being scared of drops.  
My current portfolio is:  
2.51 Shares of VOO  
1.05 Shares of SPY   
2.53 Shares of VTV   
\- These three are ETF's that I'm confident will go up long term, hence why instead of panic selling at a loss when I saw them dipping, I bought more, and made more profit.  
3.02 Shares of V   
\- As my one and only blue chip stock, I'm confident will be there for pretty much always. If anything happens to Visa and money, then there's more to worry about in the world than my shares of V going down.   
14.02 Shares of KO  
41.5 Shares of AGNC  
\- Here's where I'm kind of a bit wary. I know KO is a fine investment, and I bought these two for dividends. I trust in KO just like with V, and even though KO is down, I believe their price will raise back up once the pandemic is lifting. With a yield of about 3%, plus KO being a good investment without much growth, means I would at least have some form of stable dividends.  
\- 41.5 shares of AGNC might seem like a lot, but I also got it because it looked like it was heading towards growth, and paid out a very good dividend yield of around 7-8% currently  
I also plan on buying a few shares of a growth ETF to combo with my value ETF, and then one or two more blue chip companies to really get a feel for everything. I was down 40 bucks when I panic sold, but now I've nearly broken even within about a week, so I would consider that a very good comeback in all honesty.   
What do you think? As a new investor I'm trying to take as little risks as possible, which might sound odd because I'm a bit wary of AGNC, but to me they seemed like logical enough investments. I also am not sure if I want to try to ""snowball"" with dividends, or just go into growth stocks due to you already needing a lot of money to really get much out of dividends.",,

Similars attract. Those who are lovable themselves, because they have a beautiful inner makeup and in their nature to cherish and love the good (in both themselves and others), are spontaneously enthusiastic to see and express it with each other.

They are the ‚Äúgood‚Äù ones.

While those who care too much for themselves to humbly appreciate and honor the good of others ‚Ä¶ well, they get the unloving company of their ilk.

Many don‚Äôt understand love.
For example, someone who believes loving means subjecting oneself to be another‚Äôs possession, he could easily complain that no one wants to ‚Äúlove‚Äù him/her.
Others think that the only loveable qualities are physical.

Love is too subtle to define with words, it‚Äôs exalting and intoxicating, uplifting and healing, and externally expresses itself in cherishing the beloved and their greatest good.

It‚Äôs full expression is rare even between friends and in married couples, because there is often an element of self interest stacked on it, a conditionality: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll want your best as long as you are good to me‚Äù, ‚Äúas long as you don‚Äôt become a more accomplished person than me‚Äù, or something similar.

421,,2021-05-20 06:05:50,t3_ngsgcn,,stocks," Frontline Ltd., a shipping company, engages in the seaborne transportation of crude oil and oil products worldwide. It owns and operates oil and product tankers. As of December 31, 2020, the company operated a fleet of 68 vessels. It is also involved in the charter, purchase, and sale of vessels.

Starting with a PE ratio of 4 and a PB ratio of 1 is always a good start. But then again most taker companies are now trading at a low PE ratio. Their net income, revenue and profit margin were increasing in the last 3 years which is a really good sign. One not so good sign is their debt which has increased from 1.8 to 2.2 billion in the last 4 years.

You could consider that shipping oil is not a good business anymore because renewables but changing to renewables cannot be done in an instant so the transition will be slow. For example the Chinese oil consumption reached an all time high in December 2020. In the same time a lot of companies have reduced their number of shipping vessels due to the low demand in last year. 

To take something from their SEC filling regarding risk:

‚ÄúThe demand for our oil tankers derives primarily from demand for Arabian Gulf, West African, North Sea, Caribbean, Russian and US Shale crude oil, which, in turn, primarily depends on the economies of the world's industrial countries and competition from alternative energy sources. Any decrease in shipments of crude oil or change in trade patterns from the above mentioned geographical areas would have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Among the factors which could lead to such a decrease are:

‚Ä¢ increased crude oil production from other areas;

‚Ä¢ increased refining capacity in the Arabian Gulf or West Africa;

‚Ä¢ increased use of existing and future crude oil pipelines in the Arabian Gulf or West Africa;

‚Ä¢ a decision by oil-producing nations to increase their crude oil prices or to further decrease or limit their crude oil production;

‚Ä¢ armed conflict in the Arabian Gulf and West Africa and political or other factors; and

‚Ä¢ the development, availability and the costs of nuclear power, natural gas, coal and other alternative sources of energy. In addition, volatile economic conditions affecting world economies may result in reduced consumption of oil products and a decreased demand for our vessels and lower charter rates, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and our ability to pay dividends. ‚Äú

I don‚Äôt really know how to evaluate these so I will let you evaluate them. They also say that ‚ÄúIf the tanker industry, which historically has been cyclical and volatile, declines in the future, our revenues, earnings and available cash flow may be adversely affected.‚Äú which basically means the earnings might go up or they might go down. The same is with the stock price.

Personally I think they will do well at least the next year because the demand for oil is still high, China is running on all cylinders because they need more and more energy, the airlines will start having more airplanes in the sky which will kickstart refineries and until ‚Äúgreen solutions‚Äú kick in we will need something.

This is just for information purposes, it is not investment advice, I am not an investing professional. Do your own due diligence before investing.

Have a good week!

VW has gone all in in electro because of pressure from politics. And now they can't do anything else than push it forward at any costs if they don't want to lose a big bunch of money and prestige.

The electro motors and the electro power train are not the problem, they are very efficient right now and still room for improvements. The biggest problem the electro has right now is the battery and the charging process either in effectivity as well as in infrastructure.

Additionally the ecological footprint of the electro cars from the very beginning to the end of life is not that lower compared to conventional cars.

All three technologies... combustion, Hydrogen and Electro have pros and cons right now and are more or less in the same cathegory if you see the big picture.

I can recognise that combustion is a bit on the top of its development, I don't really expect a real technological jump in it. But IMHO it still (at least right now) is better than the others in many ways.

If both alternative technologies (electro and hydrogen) would reach the relative development status that combustion has... I think that hydrogen would be better than electro. 

Sadly, I see too, that its current development status is still far from the maturity point of electro.

If I could decide for VW... I would not deprecate the combustion yet, I would get into electro right now and try to reach a top position in market share in it, but I would create an I+D division for hydrogen because it has more potential.

But I can't influentiate anything at that level... :(",,

# **Stocks could be volatile in week ahead amid turbulence from cryptocurrency - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/21/stocks-could-be-volatile-in-week-ahead-amid-turbulence-from-cryptocurrency.html)**
*****
> The trading pattern of the past two weeks ‚Äì particularly alongside cryptocurrency‚Äôs movements ‚Äì suggests stocks could continue to be volatile in the week ahead.
*****
> Investors are watching the wild swings in b/itcoin and trying to gauge whether technology shares can gain traction after a rally attempt in the past week.
*****
> The Dow and S&P 500 were lower in the past week, but Nasdaq was slightly higher, helped by a positive move in tech, as well as buying in biotech and big cap growth names like FANG members Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix.
*****
> A steep plunge in b/itcoin after China announced new regulations soured the mood for risk assets during the past week. The U.S. also called for stricter compliance with the IRS. Further, on Friday, China said it would crack down on b/itcoin mining and trading.
*****
> ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs interesting is the market is being bullied around by where b/itcoin goes,‚Äù said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer with Bleakley Advisory Group. B/itcoin plunged by as much as 30% on Wednesday, to about $30,000. Though it recovered to above $42,000, it slid again on Friday.
*****
> The cryptocurrency was down about 9% late Friday, hovering around $36,000, according to Coin Metrics.
*****
> ‚ÄúB/itcoin is a poster child for risk appetite,‚Äù said Boockvar. ‚ÄúIt tells you the stock market is more on uneven ground, if we‚Äôre getting dragged along by b/itcoin.‚Äù
*****
> There is some key data in the week ahead. Consumer confidence, home price data and new home sales are out on Tuesday. Durable goods will be released Thursday, and the consumer sentiment report is issued Friday.
*****
> But the most important data will be the personal income and spending data, which includes the personal consumption expenditure price deflator, the Fed‚Äôs preferred inflation measure.
*****
> ‚ÄúThe key to next week is going to be the inflation numbers. The inflation numbers are now becoming the new payroll numbers in terms of market performance,‚Äù said Boockvar. ‚ÄúWhat will also be interesting is inside the consumer confidence numbers, is where the inflation expectations go.‚Äù
*****
> The consumer price index was surprisingly hot when released last week, showing core inflation at a year over year pace of 3% in April. The core PCE price index was up 1.8% year over year in March.
*****
> In the week ahead, earnings season is winding down but there continue to be reports from retailers, like Best Buy, Costco and Nordstrom. NVIDIA and Dell also report.
*****
> # No correction yet
> As the market has chopped around this month, dip buyers have stepped into the declines and snapped up perceived bargains.
*****
> Some strategists do not see a correction just yet, though pullbacks could continue.
*****
> ‚ÄúFor me, my framework is we can only get a 10% correction when we have a liquidity set back, when we have a policy tightening,‚Äù said Barry Knapp, managing partner of Ironsides Macroeconomics. ‚ÄúIn any of the little disturbances, we are getting about a 4% to 6% pullback.
*****
> Knapp said investors are fretting too much about higher interest rates being a problem for technology companies. ‚ÄúYou should be in the cyclical parts of tech,‚Äù he said. Knapp noted that subsectors like semiconductors and software should do well with the economic reopening and global manufacturing rebound.
*****
> Tech squeaked out a slight gain in the past week, gaining 0.1%, but semiconductors popped nearly 3%. Software was up 0.2%.
*****
> The Nasdaq was 0.3% higher on the week to 13,470, while the Dow was off a half percent at 34,207. The S&P 500 was down 0.4% to 4,155.
*****
> The best performing sector was real estate investment trusts, up 0.9%, followed by health care, up 0.7%. Biotech was higher on the week with the IBB iShares Nasdaq Biotech ETF, up 1.1%.
*****
> ‚ÄúIt wouldn‚Äôt shock me if we went straight back to new highs,‚Äù Knapp said. ‚ÄúPart of the reason I thought we would trade in a range, was earnings season was done but net revisions is surging.‚Äù
*****
> He said earnings for the S&P 500 are now expected to be up 7% more for the year than when the first quarter reporting season began.
*****
> Knapp expects the Fed may discuss tapering its bond buying at its Jackson Hole meeting in late summer, and that is the likely trigger for a correction. Back to World War II, he said the first correction after a recession was triggered by the Fed normalizing policy.
*****
> ‚ÄúLast cycle, we had eight of those,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúEvery attempt they made to normalize policy caused one of these risk off events.‚Äù
*****
> Knapp said it‚Äôs natural for investors to be focused on the Fed now. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an uncertainty shock,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt will cause a correction and everyone is focused on it. The Fed has not really changed its policy since the depths of the pandemic.‚Äù
*****
> Knapp said Treasury yields have drifted lower during efforts in Washington to reach a bipartisan plan on infrastructure spending. But he expects the market to react differently in the next two weeks, since he expects those efforts will clearly fail and Democrats will focus on a big spending program that will increase the deficit.
*****
> The b/itcoin crypto mania was lifted by the idea of big spending from Washington, and the infrastructure spending could be positive. ‚ÄúThe thing that was the surprise in 2021 that really drove the mania was the blue wave and then the spending blowout,‚Äù he said, noting b/itcoin gained on the potential for inflation and big deficit spending.

> # Economic Surprise Index Tips Negative For The First Time In A Year

> While the overall trend of economic data has been for further improvement, things have slowed recently relative to expectations. In the charts below, we show the charts of the Citi Economic Surprise indices for the US, Emerging Markets, the Eurozone, and the entire world. Broadly speaking, positive readings indicate that economic data is coming in better than forecasts while negative readings indicate the opposite. Every region of the globe has pulled back over the past couple of months but for the most part, current readings remain at the high end of their historical ranges. In fact, the indices for Emerging Markets, Eurozone, and the whole globe all sit in the top 3% of all readings in their histories. The one place that is not the case is the US. Since last summer, the surprise index has been trending lower off of record levels, and just yesterday, it hit it tipped negative for the first time since June 2nd of last year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/CESI.png))**

> Lasting 248 trading days, this was the longest streak of consecutive positive readings in the index's history dating back to 2003. The only other streak that lasted nearly as long was a 189 day long one which came to an end in June 2018.

> # Post-Election-Year June: Third Worst S&P 500 Month

> June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks over the last 50 years as a rule ranking sixth with a 0.9% average gain, up 28 of 50 years. This contributes to NASDAQ‚Äôs ‚ÄúBest Eight Months‚Äù which ends in June. June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.2%. S&P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking ninth, but essentially flat (0.1% average gain). Small caps also tend to fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.8% in the month since 1979.

> In post-election years since 1953, June still ranks poorly and its average loss for DJIA increases to ‚Äì1.1% while S&P 500‚Ä≤s modestly positive performance becomes a 0.6% loss. DJIA struggles the most, advancing in just four post-election year Junes (1977, 1985, 1997 and 2017). Russell 2000 fares best, up seven times in ten years with an average gain of 1.2%. NASDAQ lands in the middle, advancing 50% of the time with an average gain of 0.4%

> # May Manufacturing Starting Off Strong

> The first manufacturing data for May came out this morning with the release of the New York Fed's Empire State Manufacturing Survey. General business conditions remain at historically strong levels although there was some slowing in May as was expected. After hitting the highest level since October 2017 last month, it was expected to fall to 23.9 in May. The index did in fact decline, but only to 24.3. While lower, that is still around some of the strongest levels (excluding last month) in three years as more businesses continue to report improvements in business conditions than weakness.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-1.png))**

> Breadth in this month's report was pretty mixed; namely with regards to current conditions versus expectations. Every index is still showing an expansionary reading with particular strength out of the indices for the present situation. In fact, most of those indices still sit in the top decile of their historical range with a few like those for unfilled orders, delivery times, and prices even at or just off of record highs. But there were a handful that moved lower: delivery times, inventories, and number of employees.

> Regarding expectations, it was much harder to find an increase. Delivery times and technology spending were the only two of these indices to rise month over month. While many indices for expectations still sit at historically strong levels, there are more that are middling within their respective historical ranges. Overall, the report showed that New York area firms have seen a peak in optimism even as they continue to report strong conditions.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-Table.png))**

> Demand certainly appears to be one area without much in the way of weakness. New orders rose 2 points month over month to 28.9. That is the highest level in just over 15 years and the only other readings as high occurred throughout late 2003 to mid-2004. Those orders are making their way out the door at an increased rate too as shipments climbed to 29.7. That index has been making a vertical climb since the winter as it reached its highest level since August 2007.

> Despite this, NY area firms are not fulfilling orders fast enough. Last month saw the Unfilled Orders index rise by one of the largest amounts in a single month on record, and it continued to climb albeit by a much smaller 0.2 points in May. The only month on record with a higher reading in unfilled orders was September 2001. Inventories were one of the few current condition indices to fall in May, although the reading still indicated growth. In other words, those unfilled orders are not necessarily drawing down on inventory levels.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-2.png))**

> Supply chains are one of the main areas that are likely holding things back. Higher readings in the delivery times index mean that businesses are reporting that it takes longer for products to reach their destination. Even after falling 4.5 points in May off of the April record, the current level sits well above the prior record high of 16.2 from March 2018.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-3.png))**

> In addition to taking longer for products to get to where they are going, the price point is on the rise. Both indices for prices paid and received rose to record highs in May. In fact, over the past two months, there has not been a single respondent to have reported a decrease in prices paid. That is the first time that has occurred since February and March 2012.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-4.png))**

> Last week saw a blockbuster job openings report and the Empire Fed survey is showing a similar willingness to take on more workers. The current conditions index for the number of employees continues to show that businesses are on net increasing their workforce, though at a slowed pace from April. Additionally, the index is at a much less elevated part of its range (the 81st percentile) relative to other indices within the report, but the much more elevated reading in expectations (98th percentile) would indicate the businesses would like to take on far more workers. That is, there appears to be a bit of a disconnect between the actual number of new hires and businesses' expectations to take on more workers. Potentially as a result of an inability to hire enough workers, the average workweek has continued to climb. At 18.7, the index is at its highest level in a decade.

> # Homebuilder Sentiment Holds Steady

> Our new Constitution is now established, everything seems to promise it will be durable; but, in this world, nothing is certain except death and taxes,‚Äù Benjamin Franklin

> The national average on a 30 year fixed rate mortgage currently sits around 3.06%, little changed over the past month. Homebuilder sentiment as measured by the NAHB Housing Market Index similarly went unchanged in May staying at 83. Although it has been six months since the record high of 90 without much of a push back up to those record levels, homebuilder sentiment continues to come in well above anything observed prior to the pandemic. Commentary from the NAHB noted that the strong reading on homebuilder confidence is thanks to the low housing inventories, low rates, and strong demand, despite the headwinds of rising costs. While that could have played into the small decline in traffic, future sales did tick higher.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-NAHB-HL.png))**
> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-NAHB-Table.png))**

> Whereas the headline number was flat on the month, readings based on each region saw much more variety. By far the largest move was for the Northeast. Since running back up to the record high back in February, homebuilder sentiment in the Northeast has fallen for three straight months and is now at the lowest level since January. The decline in sentiment in the Northeast is relatively recent. Whereas the region tied its record high earlier this year, the other regions all peaked out in the fall. For the Midwest, the declines have kept coming with 3 point declines in each of the past three months alone. The West and South, on the other hand, have found some respite. The South has ticked higher by 2 points in back-to-back months as it reached the highest level since December. Meanwhile, the West was unchanged at 91 in May.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-NAHB-Region.png))**

> As for homebuilder stocks, the iShares US Home Construction ETF (ITB) had been trading in overbought territory throughout most of the spring but in the past couple of weeks, it has come back down to Earth. Last Wednesday, ITB successfully tested its 50-DMA with a small bounce at the tail end of the week. So far today, it has turned lower alongside the broader market with a 1.35% decline. While that means Friday's close marks a lower high, for the time being, the uptrend is still intact.

*****

> # Increased Caution Across Sentiment Indicators

> The S&P 500 has been holding up at its 50-DMA in the past week while more speculative areas of the market (i.e. crypto) have experienced wild swings. As a result, sentiment on the part of individual investors has not seen much of a move. The American Association of Individual Investors' weekly reading on bullish sentiment was little changed this week climbing half of one percentage point to 37%. Although that was not a large move in the past week, sentiment has taken a big hit over the past month having fallen from well above 50%. In spite of that big drop and even though sentiment is around the lowest levels of the past half-year, the current sentiment level is within one percentage point of the historical average. In other words, optimism is low versus recent history but is very much middling from a longer term perspective.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Bull.png))**

> Meanwhile, bearish sentiment fell 0.7 percentage points to 26.3%. Unlike bullish sentiment, that is a bit lower than the historical average of 30.5%

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Bear.png))**

> Those corresponding moves meant the bull-bear spread climbed to 10.7 from 9.5 the prior week. Excluding last week, that is still one of the lowest readings since February.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Bull-Bear.png))**

> Neutral sentiment has been the star of the show recently. The gain this week was tiny at only 0.2 percentage points, but nonetheless, it marked the fifth consecutive week in which neutral sentiment has risen. At 36.7%, it is now at the highest level since the second week of 2020.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Neutral.png))**

> The Investors Intelligence survey of equity newsletter writers took a less optimistic tone this week as bullish sentiment fell 4.1 percentage points to a ten-week low of 54.5%. Bearish sentiment was unchanged at the highest level since the end of March. The survey also questions respondents on whether or not they expect a correction. That reading rose 4.1 percentage points to 28.3% in the biggest one-week uptick since the last week of April when it rose 4.7 percentage points. That leaves the reading at the highest level since the week of March 10th. Before that, you would need to go back to September 23rd to find as high of a reading.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-II-Correction.png))**

> Another sentiment reading that has taken an even more dramatically negative tone lately has been the National Association of Active Investment Managers Exposure Index. This index measures how exposed to equities managers are where readings of 200 would mean they are leveraged long, 100 would be fully invested long, 0 would be neutral, -100 is fully short, and -200 is leveraged short. This week saw the index fall another 2.65 points after a massive 40-point decline last week. That is the lowest level since last March and April of last year. Altogether, while sentiment still favors bulls, there has been a more cautious tone that has been reflected in managers reducing exposure to equities.

623,,2021-05-20 06:05:50,t3_ngsgcn,,stocks," Frontline Ltd., a shipping company, engages in the seaborne transportation of crude oil and oil products worldwide. It owns and operates oil and product tankers. As of December 31, 2020, the company operated a fleet of 68 vessels. It is also involved in the charter, purchase, and sale of vessels.

Starting with a PE ratio of 4 and a PB ratio of 1 is always a good start. But then again most taker companies are now trading at a low PE ratio. Their net income, revenue and profit margin were increasing in the last 3 years which is a really good sign. One not so good sign is their debt which has increased from 1.8 to 2.2 billion in the last 4 years.

You could consider that shipping oil is not a good business anymore because renewables but changing to renewables cannot be done in an instant so the transition will be slow. For example the Chinese oil consumption reached an all time high in December 2020. In the same time a lot of companies have reduced their number of shipping vessels due to the low demand in last year. 

To take something from their SEC filling regarding risk:

‚ÄúThe demand for our oil tankers derives primarily from demand for Arabian Gulf, West African, North Sea, Caribbean, Russian and US Shale crude oil, which, in turn, primarily depends on the economies of the world's industrial countries and competition from alternative energy sources. Any decrease in shipments of crude oil or change in trade patterns from the above mentioned geographical areas would have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Among the factors which could lead to such a decrease are:

‚Ä¢ increased crude oil production from other areas;

‚Ä¢ increased refining capacity in the Arabian Gulf or West Africa;

‚Ä¢ increased use of existing and future crude oil pipelines in the Arabian Gulf or West Africa;

‚Ä¢ a decision by oil-producing nations to increase their crude oil prices or to further decrease or limit their crude oil production;

‚Ä¢ armed conflict in the Arabian Gulf and West Africa and political or other factors; and

‚Ä¢ the development, availability and the costs of nuclear power, natural gas, coal and other alternative sources of energy. In addition, volatile economic conditions affecting world economies may result in reduced consumption of oil products and a decreased demand for our vessels and lower charter rates, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and our ability to pay dividends. ‚Äú

I don‚Äôt really know how to evaluate these so I will let you evaluate them. They also say that ‚ÄúIf the tanker industry, which historically has been cyclical and volatile, declines in the future, our revenues, earnings and available cash flow may be adversely affected.‚Äú which basically means the earnings might go up or they might go down. The same is with the stock price.

Personally I think they will do well at least the next year because the demand for oil is still high, China is running on all cylinders because they need more and more energy, the airlines will start having more airplanes in the sky which will kickstart refineries and until ‚Äúgreen solutions‚Äú kick in we will need something.

This is just for information purposes, it is not investment advice, I am not an investing professional. Do your own due diligence before investing.

Have a good week!

The ministery of education doesn't want classes after 9pm on school days. One source talked about a ban on classes during the weekends, which would have a detrimental impact on the online K-12 tutoring business model. 

The goal is to put less pressure on children and lessen the financial burden on parents. The government wants to stop the decline of the birth rate and doesn't care about the impact on after school tutoring companies.

[https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/05/21/marketplace-asia-alibaba-cainiao.cnnbusiness](https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/05/21/marketplace-asia-alibaba-cainiao.cnnbusiness)

&#x200B;

Alibaba, the mega-cap Chinese conglomerate has had a rough 3 months. After for CEO Jack Ma ticked off the CCP, the company was slapped with billions in anti-competitive fines and then the U.S. is pushing for all Chinese stocks on the U.S. markets be audited using U.S. standards. This has caused the stock to drop from it's highs of $319 to just $210 as of Friday. I normally stay away from Chinese stocks, but I loaded up shares at $212 after these two firms took large positions at the $225-$245 range...Generation Investment Management (founded by former VP Al Gore) and the Daily Journal (led by Charlie Munger....Warren Buffet's right hand man.)

&#x200B;

Why do I care about these two firms? Well Al Gore's firm based out of London mainly invests in companies that cause no harm to the environment, something I like to hear. Gore's firm nearly DOUBLED their position in $BABA in Q1. $BABA had just reported its first ever loss after the CCP slapped it with anti-competitive fines of over 18 billion yes (3.6b U.S.) causing fear that additional actions could be taken. In addition to the fines, the U.S. wants all Chinese companies listed in the U.S. to undergo audits according to U.S. accounting practices. At the time, it seemed the bad news was baked in and the behemoth had reached rock bottom. Now after the recent selloff in stocks, $BABA sits at $210, just 10% off it's 52 week low.

&#x200B;

Now what REALLY caused me to go all in was reading that [Munger had put in an investment that represented nearly 20% of the Daily Journal's portfolio](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charlie-mungers-daily-journal-buys-162550289.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAANWUgsT5pGhYhcHBDH3BmAeqjyPDiJhY46k1tJyHfgxNp1KXjoNUp_RUeUxc9964F9DRudOxJfqmOg2xTb0Bce561ukNR_6nLr7xj7-zvq7G6DV89DfgNfLOnzdtlnrj47ITxpu0SSCY4sEXz9qyDqqkh7JsvoXakKYZtyYt7dK)! First off, the Daily Journal only holds 5 stocks...(in order) $BAC, $WFC, $BABA, $USB, and $POSCO.  For Munger to invest (and make it his 3rd largest holding), he and his team must view that stock as EXTREMELY undervalued. For a wide-moat mega-cap stock to have a 50% upside ([52 analyst price targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BABA/)), the current price is truly insane. In their view, a company with 91% penetration in the internet services, streaming, fintech, retail, and cloud storage (they're currently investing HEAVILY into this sector...similar to Amazon) that trades at a mere 26x earnings yet is growing at a CAGR of 18% is simply too good to pass up.

&#x200B;

In short, there are times when investing seems easy. As Buffett says ""We simply attempt to be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy."" $BABA fear has been baked in, and now I plan to back up the truck.",niiukt,$BABA is Now A Value Stock with 50% Upside - Time to Load Up

1. Do you guys really think, that the big energy players will sit and watch the game from the sideline? And yes, hydrogen is a loooong term solution, which will be profitable from 2030 on... Why? Because whole fkn Europe is supposed to get CO2 neutral by 2050 and the Nordic countries in Europe are constantly building their hydrogen infrastructure, to be the supplier for core countries like Germany and France. 

2. Hydrogen will eventually be profitable, our oil and gas infrastructure took trillions to build up and it would be great if we could use parts of it in future too. Ohh and btw, to all ppl who say that hydrogen is to expensive, yes, you're right, but look at the development in PV  and onshore wind market, it's now not only competitive to fossil fuels, but is outcompeting them. 
Ten years ago, nobody would have believe in that. 

3. Give hydrogen the competitiveness of capitalistic market mechanism, then we will see what hydrogen is able to doo. (Btw, it's not hocus-pocus, it's the most abundant element in the universe, not utilising it would be bollocks)

Disney has games, merch, theme parks oriented around its characters. Netflix has built all these universes, but they only go as far as a few seasons of streaming.

As far as I understand, Netflix doesn't necessarily own the IP's of those Netflix Originals. afaik Netflix Original typically means they order the production to have exclusive distribution rights; doesn't mean they fully own the IP. Netflix Original can mean multiple things: self-produced/co-produced content (like with Stranger Things still doesn't necessarily mean they own the IP) or licensed original programming that is exclusive to Netflix (though not necessarily worldwide).

It doesn't mean they also acquire the IP under the contract they signed with the production company/creators/IP owners even for co-produced content.

Case in point for some of the most popular shows on Netflix:

* Stranger Things is owned by the Duffer brothers (creators and exec producers of the series)
* Cobra Kai is owned by Sony Pictures
* The Crown is owned by Left Bank Pictures (Sony Pictures Television)
* Lucifer is owned by Warner Bros./DC Entertainment

Same thing for some of the older popular shows like House of Cards, Orange Is the New Black, Narcos. All owned by external production companies.

Netflix biggest advantage over the other streaming services is by far and away their brand.",,

If you like doing research and want to work at learning to invest, put the rest in stocks.  If not, just put it in VTI.  Fuddling with asset allocations is a complete waste of time and effort.  It's like cutting supermarket coupons to save five cents on milk.   You're better off learning something fundamental about companies or markets or economies.  

I'm 100% stocks for over 15 years and have done well.  I don't bother with canned methodologies like ""growth"" or ""value"" or ""dividend"" investing or sector allocations or bonds or any of that crap.  Just buy stocks in strong companies when there is a good price opportunity and sell the same way.   

I've read many Buffet books.  They were great in terms of learning about how to read financial statements.  But in the end his complicated valuation strategies don't provide much return on the effort.  Over the last 20 yrs no one cared about AMZNs ROE or whatever, they bought the stock because it was screaming upwards, and it was screaming upwards bcz AMZN was growing revenue stupidly fast.  For AAPL and GOOG the same, with profit also important for them.

Look at the 20 year or older chart on any stock or index. The hills and mountains go up sharply but gradual when we went from paper to computer (about 1994ish) which opened up the market to anyone with enough money and a computer. Gone were the days of calling your broker and driving to the bank. 

You can see when QE and the ‚ÄúFEDs printer goes brrr ‚Äú were added after 2008. You can see the affect of lowering the interest rates. 

All this additional money combined with recent low tax policies on corporations and individuals, extremely low interest rates, and you have the market climbing large mountains very easily. 

When we get to 2020 and COVID you see the fear drop but then with low tax business friendly policies, low inflation, additional stimulus money, additional printing & treasury buying, easy margin access because of low interest, retail investors jumping in with their cool new apps and stimulus checks, government interventions (EV and green energy money) added to the market and it looks like Mount Everest. Straight up. 

What happens when that goes away? Taxes are about to change and the Fed wants to stop adding. We are being told interest rates will go up and inflation needs to go up 2 or 3% in the way the Fed measures it. 

How many more stimulus checks do we think we are getting? What will finally pass in Congress regarding infrastructure? Do we think this has no limits? Even if the government withdraws help really slow? 

If you draw a trend line from 2000 to 2021 you can see the extreme nature of this pattern. 

So my question is how long do we trade sideways or will we go down the other side of this mountain? 

I can‚Äôt see the market going up like it has without all that help from the government and they are telling us they want off the mountain.

Interest rates are unhealthily low. An increase in rates would be healthy for the economy and would be healthy for equities after the sticker shock wore off.

Inflation concerns are nonsense. When rates increase to a healthy level it will be a non issue. Again, short term corrections are possible but long term we are looking at a period of strong healthy growth incoming.

We recovered from a deep dive this year. We didn't see unsustainable growth as much as we saw the whole market gap down and then spend the last year filling that gap back up.

In any case, if you are worried about a correction investing in index funds OBVIOUSLY is safer than individual stocks because of the inherent diversification. There are defensive funds that you can buy into as well such as consumer staples and value funds.

Maybe the market will pull back reflexively to some short term catalysts.

As for BABA going belly up, it is of course an additional risk, but we're talking about Alibaba here. I doubt very much again that BABA would go bankrupt, especially with their market strength/position. 

Finally, the political risk. This one has been around literally since BABA first listed on NYSE.

Virgin Galactic is not currently involved in space travel, not sure how many times that needs to be said lol. It's tourism, in the same way that cruise ships aimlessly wander around the oceans and coasts, and helicopter tours hover around arbitrary areas and then land back exactly where they started, accomplishing nothing (objectively speaking) yet charging extravagant amounts of money.

> there is no economic incentive to take people to space. It's an endless vacuum and hell scape, so far useful for nothing

Could you tell me what cruise ships and $50 million yachts are useful for? What about about luxury resort vacations, are those useful? To use your own example, how ""useful"" is flying a plane up to ~15,000 ft and then literally just jumping out of it? Certainly no economic incentive in any of those things (like the skydiving market which is *easily* over a billion dollar industry).

That is all not to mention that, on top of tourism, Virgin Galactic even has a potential business model to [literally as you put it] **""...get from point a to point b faster""**, however I'm not even arguing for that.

961,,2021-05-22 15:20:27,t3_nikw11,,stocks,"Short answer: don't. I work in the industry and learned early on not to touch it with a ten-foot pole. If you want to invest in the pharma/biopharma/biotech industry, investing in small-cap biotech stocks - MBIO, VKTX, ATOS, etc. for examples is basically gambling. Here are the alternatives I suggest.

Supply chain. TMO and AVTR are the two biggest suppliers of consumables in the life sciences industry and essentially hold a duopoly. Both are basically trying to position themselves as the amazon of the industry. TMO is more diversified offering various services and high-powered equipment and is on the cutting-edge of R&D in a lot of equipment fields (MS and cryo-EM). AVTR owns VWR which is basically like an Amazon/costco hybrid for companies and academia. I highly recommend choosing one or both.

Equipment. TMO/AVTR kind of fall into this category but I wanted to make a different section because they pretty much own the entire consumables market. Instrumentation has a lot more competition. While something like TMO has its hands dipped into anything, almost nobody would choose a TMO HPLC over Agilent (A) or Waters (WAT). PCR? Bio-Rad (BIO). Centrifuges? Beckman Coulter (DHR). A lot of companies have carved out niches for themselves whereas something like TMO is a generalist. You also have companies like DHR that hold brands like Beckman Coulter that have a lot of brand loyalty.

Services. CROs like IQVIA, PPD, manufacturing services, instrumentation (calibration, maintenance) services etc. One of the most expensive things about the industry is the regulatory hurdles, especially clinical trials. CROs help companies save money on clinical trials by outsourcing them to companies already equipped to handle different parts of them. Equipment has to have records of being ""up to spec"" for audit purposes and a lot of companies do this stuff in-house or let the vendors send service techs out. You also have companies like TMO with their unity service that do this stuff. They also recently bought out Patheon and PPD so they're expanding the services side of their company a lot.

Tech. This sort of falls under equipment and services so I won't spend too long on it, but companies like Illumina have revolutionized things in their fields (DNA sequencing for Illumina).

Big pharma/biopharma/biotech. You can still benefit from the excitement of a positive clinical trial result without the volatility. The issue with small-cap biotech is that you'll bleed out 70% over the course of a few months, and by the time you get that 25% bump from a positive trial result you're still extremely deep in the red. These companies completely hinge on a very small amount of drugs which is why they're such a gamble. Companies like PFE, ABBV have blockbuster drugs under their belt that keep them relatively stable and allow them to pay dividends. The 25% bump from a positive result you'd see from biotech is buffered to be more like 5-10%, but at least you know you won't (probably) lose 90% of your investment.

Last but not least... ETFs. Pharma, biotech and medical devices ETFs all hold a lot of these aforementioned categories/companies.",nikw11,Want to invest in biotech? A quick guide.

979,gz2aetb,2021-05-22 15:25:13,t1_gz2aetb,t1_gz1yzco,stocks,"Hydrogen is not a long term play. It is an energy intensive process to make hydrogen. It will likely therefor remain irrelevant. Time consuming and costly to distribute. Not likely to be mainstream while electricity becomes free and battery technology is on the verge of cracking the ""I don't actually have to think about charging"" barrier.

Hydrogen gas is an expensive foray into extending the life of a desperate oil dependent petro dollar driven industry. Refineries need an excuse to stay relevant if the oil money is to continue and as a result the only people who care are oil producers. Trust me bro, with enough energy storage and prolific renewables all gasses and combustible fuels turn into hobbyist-only materials.

Carbon neutral gas and fuels are coming, you think every house in Europe is going to suddenly switch out ever valve and mechanism to handle hydrogen explosive instead of methane??

The system will tend towards maximum cost efficiency. Electricity is what will win. No more fuels, only charge. Fuel will remain only where absolutely no other electric option will work.",,

Great prospects but you have to remember three of these companies are holding on to a lot of debt on their balance sheet and require liquidity from the government or others to fund their day to day activities and investments.
