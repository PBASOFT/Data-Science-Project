The driver is very quick to take over and not allowing the car to fully make decisions, that being said when the car was passing in front the driver was right to take over as that could have been messy. At the same time this is also one of the worst ‚Äúclose calls‚Äù videos I‚Äôve seen where the car continues to make mistakes much more often than I‚Äôve seen in the past and the driver really does not give the car a chance to correct itself as he takes over control way to quickly.

VWR and Fisher (owned by TMO) are the most commonly used catalog services for consumables, but that doesn't mean they make all of them. Corning and BD, as well as brands owned by Thermo like Pyrex and Nalgene, are big in lab plastics and glassware. For chemicals, in addition to Fisher and J.T. Baker (owned by TMO and AVTR respectively), MilliporeSigma (Merck KGaA outside the US) is huge and there are a lot of smaller brands. For things like gloves and paper products, it's mostly KimTech (a Kimberly-Clark brand). For more specialized things there's always a variety of providers. Eppendorf is synonymous with microcentrifuge tubes. Cytiva (Danaher), MiliporeSigma, and BioRad are big providers of chromatography resins and Repligen has kind of cornered the market on prepacked columns. Filters vary based on types with the workhorse ones mostly provided by MilliporeSigma or Sartorius in my experience. I've mostly seen depth filters from 3M, viral filters from MilliporeSigma or Asahi Kasei, and TFF filters from Pall (also Danaher).  

I'd also say that you're simplifying the equipment space, particularly downplaying how big Danaher is (especially since the Cytiva acquisition). Mettler Toledo definitely deserves a mention for scales, pipets (Rainin is one of their brands), and pH meters. Sartorius also makes equipment of larger scale for manufacturing. There's also a ton of more niche equipment made by more specialized brands.",,

Both scenarios would effectively, but not officially, make the company a CCP asset.

63,gz66dt0,2021-05-23 15:46:00,t1_gz66dt0,t1_gz5wjzg,stocks,"Yes I have. Im fairly new to trading (little over 2 years) but I have never done DD on any stock like I have done with GME. I get a lot of my information from r/superstonk, but I check everything, try my best to sniff out the bullshit, and come up with my own analysis. 

GME is just an anomaly, can we agree on that? I mean just with the baby squeeze (my opinion) then the drop down to $38, and then the rush back up to $347, and now we sit here at the $175 range. Its just crazy!

If it were a constant pump and dump by HF why would they not drop the price down to $40 again or lower than that even? Why stop at the $135-150 area? I mean its profitable but not close to what they have been used to, plus if you believe the news (I dont) they lost almost a billion last week alone. They seem to be losing money, not making money. So that theory just doesn‚Äôt add up IMO.

From the DD that has been found on R/superstonk, you can see that HF can hide true SI in put options. So the true SI is only known by the shorters. I believe whole heartedly they never covered, and that the 140% they initially reported was much lower than the true SI. 140% being the highest allowed SI that can be reported. I mean an increase to $500 could be a squeeze but with Reported SI being 140%, I just dont believe they were covering their position all the way up to $500. Look at past squeezes, last year DGAZF had a short squeeze with an SI of 45% and the price rose from $125 to $25k in less than a week. Look at the Volkswagen squeeze in ‚Äò08. They admitted in the first congressional hearing that if the buy button was not turned off that the price would have hit the $1000s. 

You really cant deny the blatant manipulation that has gone on with GME. From the articles being released of sudden drops, before those drops happen to RH and other brokers restricting trading, is just mystifying. Just look into naked short selling, and the power they have. http://www.gilmermirror.com/view/full_story/27799969/article-Video--The-Wall-Street-Conspiracy--Full-Movie-Free-Online-With-Permission-of-Owner-?instance=news_special_coverage_right_column

I mean take the squeeze out of the equation here. All signs point towards a crash coming. GME has a negative beta. Wouldn‚Äôt that be a safe hedge against the upcoming crash? That coupled with Ryan Cohen and the team he has put together at GameStop, you have to admit it would be hard to bet against him at this point. 

Maybe Im wrong, and Im not denying that could be a possibility, but theres just to much going on here in plain site for me not to smell some bullshit and fuckery going on. Do I think the price will hit the millions? Probably not. I believe it has infinite potential, and I will be holding X amount of shares to see if that comes to fruition. I do believe though that we will see a true short squeeze, and I have my own exit strategy. Seeing how I bought the majority of my shares at $45 I have been in the green for a couple months now and nowhere near my cost basis. Time will tell. June 9th is not far off my friend :)",,

The entire point to ""cloud"" is you can leverage the cloud provider network for easy scaling. Otherwise its really no different than a traditional setup. But governments have unlimited funds, value security over efficiency and their scale is limited to their own country and possibly a few other nodes.

In other words, government moving to 3rd party services will be limited. You are asking them to risk security (more eyes who can see data) for convenience... governments generally dont do that except for less important data. For instance when I worked for them, they would use 3rd party servers like the monthly defac menu or for sports events or sales at the local retail store. But nothing vital ever leaves the military networks.

Again growth will come but I think people are over estimating the growth potential. Government shouldnt be counted on to generate more growth. Cloud is more useful for commercial purposes to provide high performance on large scale.",,

The result is that their investment portfolio is earning something like <0.50% annually. Overnights are below 10 bps right now, money markets are below 5 bps, and low investment grade CP is like 20-30 bps for month long paper. It's a terrible time for yields.

119,,2021-05-23 16:15:49,t3_njazsm,,stocks,"#Disclaimer! I'm not saying i'm bullish (or bearish) on TSLA, just that this particular argument is weak.

Many TSLA bears point out the risk of increased competition resulting from companies moving into the EV space, especially since nearly all major makes now have an EV either in production or in development. 

For one, most of these cars target a completely different customer. Simply, cars like the Nissan Leaf or Chevy Bolt aren't cutting into Tesla sales just like the Toyota Corolla isn't cutting into BMW 330i sales. While it's true that ""better"" or more luxury lines like the Audi E-Tron are coming out, they're still not quite there in terms of competitive features and price point. It's reasonable to think many customers who are buying a $70k car are willing to spending another $10k for significantly better range, a bigger battery, better charging infrastructure, falcon wing doors, etc. Think about it, how many Model Xs do you see on the road versus an Audi E-Tron or Jaguar I-PACE? Yes, those cars newer, but there are other reasons for their dismal sales too. So while there's going to be *some* buyers choosing these new EVs over a Tesla, it's not the doom and gloom that Tesla bears seem to think. IMO, The competition between EVs versus ICEs is much more significant than the competition between EVs.

Lastly and most importantly, this increase in ""competition"" just draw more attention to the EV market in general, which will always be good for Tesla and this is why Musk has always pushed for more competition in the EV space. For instance, if we take the current EV market to have a relative ""size"" or value of 1 and Tesla owns 90% of it, that's a size or value of 0.9 for Tesla. But if this competition and attention causes the EV market to grow to 3 but Tesla only owns 40% of it, that's still a size of 1.2 for Tesla.",njazsm,"Increased ""competition"" in the EV space is bullish news for TSLA, not bearish"

These things are unrelated, and plenty of companies do not receive bailouts.

Right, this just isn't true from a corporate lending perspective. Investors are not purchasing new debt at anything considered close to friendly rates for companies that are either defaulting on their debt or over leveraged to the point where they're no longer considered investment grade. 

>They can't pay, they get given more loans.

Frankly I did not expect to hold so long. I bought expecting a faster return to normal and if I knew in advance they wouldn't sail in the US until July 2021 I would assume it would be a bad investment. 

However, now they are confirmed to sail in July. I guess the hype that is left would be the cruises actually sailing successfully, and then the announcement of what they will do with their reserve cash ($11.5 billion compared to their usual $1 billion or less). They have around $26 billion in long-term debt (compared to $9 billion before the coronavirus) so I imagine it is a priority to pay off that. Then there are expenses of getting the cruises prepared to sail and upkeep. 

So even if CCL were to pay off $10 billion (maybe not the best use of funds) of their debt they would still be $6 billion more in debt than before the coronavirus with their dividend gone and shares heavily diluted.

In fact, their market cap is practically the same as it was pre-covid. In December 2019 they had a run up but the market cap now is actually higher than it was in November 2019. It would require billions in stock buybacks for the share price to rise to it's pre-covid levels (which included a dividend), on top of the billions needed to pay for debt/upkeep. Not to mention CCL was actually in a downtrend from 2018 on, with the market cap going from $50 billion to $30 billion.

So why would I hold now? Even if they have a successful year I'm having trouble justifying why they would continue to grow and outpace the SPY.

I personally also do financial modelling to map out price targets a few years out (my targeted holding period). I won‚Äôt say they are accurate, but they give a rough estimate of what you can expect if the company meets your projections. 

I use multiples based on current and historical data and sometimes average them to get a final multiple as ‚Äúbase case‚Äù (assuming the multiples in the future will remain the same as multiples I calculated). Atm the multiples are usually on the higher side, so if there are high multiples, I might make an average excluding those years (2020/2021). 

Projected growth I usually use based on historical growth. If it‚Äôs not consistent, I look towards their annual reports, meetings, analyst projections and see if those align. I might gather these and then make my own projection on a more conservative rate ( better to be conservative imo). 

Current quarterly reports I usually update into my financial model to see if they are on track with my target and if not they‚Äôre adjusted. 

I do this with all the companies I own and in my watchlist. I also do this as a way to skim through companies to see if they might be worth investing if they are cheap. It takes a bit of work in the beginning, but if you can consolidate everything into 1 excel file to make a dashboard, you can keep a good eye on all your other excels and see if there are good opportunities during corrections. It might be a lot of work for some, but it‚Äôs something I like doing on my spare time. 

Just like to also note that what I do isn‚Äôt necessarily the ‚Äúright way‚Äù to analyze a company. Analyzing a company and investing is more of an art than a science because there are so many ways to get a ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù answer to investment decisions.",,

Volatility drag affects all instruments. Assuming a normal ticket with 1x leverage such as QQQ has a 3% loss it needs about a 3.4% gain to fully recover from the loss. This drag is further pronounced with TQQQ as a larger loss needs an even larger gain to recover from. This isn't just a downside though as consistent daily positive returns will have a larger than 3x total return.

Assume QQQ starts at 100 and has two 3% days in a row 

QQQ would return $106.09 for a 6.09% return while TQQQ would return $118.81 for a 18.81% gain which is greater than 3x6.09. 

In addition TQQQ primarily used total return swaps which do not have time decay but have a fixed fee associated with them.

""Once the short seller borrows the shares from the lender and then sells them back into the market, the new owner of the shares is free to lend them out, just as the previous owner did, and have no idea they are on the other side of a short sale

Settlement time is two days after the transaction. In that time, the same shares can be lent out again, and again. This makes it possible, on paper, for more than 100% of the float of a stock to be shorted.
According to financial analytics firm S3, GameStop's peak short interest was 141.8% of its float on Jan. 4.
S3 argued in a recent research note that the traditional method of calculating the percentage of float is flawed because it uses stale data. U.S. investors are required to mark their shares shorted and regulators report these figures twice a month, with a 10-day delay, S3 said.""",,

According to this [irs post](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/some-nonresidents-with-us-assets-must-file-estate-tax-returns) ,  Certain deceased nonresidents who were not citizens of the United States are subject to U.S. estate taxation with respect to their U.S.-situated assets. They also list stock of corporations under us law as an example of something that would fall under us law.

Am I wrong to say that I (my kids) will be liable for a high US estate tax and talking to the IRS upon death?

With that, I have a follow up question, and that is, how do these rules apply to me buying UK stocks. Here, I have not found any posts that specifically reference non citizen, non residents. The closest to that I found was this [gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/tax-uk-income-live-abroad/selling-or-inheriting-assets) which says that you only pay inheritance tax on land, but then also on the same page says shares could also be liable for the tax???

In simple terms Enthusiast Gaming is company that aims to create massive gaming media network that then could be monetized by advertising, subscriptions, merchandise and content licensing. As such, its not not video games developer or publisher. It is more similar to advertising conglomerates like IPG, WPP or Omnicom who own many smaller agency businesses.

Currently, the company owns over 100 websites focusing on unique gaming  content (Destructoid, The escapist, Nintendo Enthusiasts, etc), YouTube channels with a combined 24 million+ subscribers (Wisecrack, The Squad, The Count Down, etc),  professional Esports teams such as Luminosity Gaming, influencers across  many different social media platforms, and it was responsible for  hosting live Esports events pre-COVID 19. Taken together, its platforms reach an audience of over 300 million gamers on a monthly basis. Enthusiast's esports subsidiary Luminosity Gaming owns teams  competing in Fortnite, Apex Legends, and a variety of other games. The  company helps Enthusiast get access to its own esports content and gain a  foothold in the $1 bil+ esports market.

65 million of the 300 million monthly users are located in the U.S.  alone. This is important because when it comes to eventual monetization,  U.S. ‚Äúeyes‚Äù are traditionally those that have the highest value. Half of every American male between the age of 18 and 34 visited at least one of the platforms owned by Enthusiast Gaming. This is an important  demographic, since it is one of the hardest-to-reach ones, and is one  the demographics that spends the most on non-essential goods and has a  larger lifetime value, since they are in the early stages of their  lives. The CEO mentions how 70% of the company's audience is either Gen Z or Millennials, with 65% of its audience spending more than 15  hours a week gaming. 67% of its platform users purchase more than 7 video games every year. Referring back to the importance of this demographic because it is hard to reach; an astounding 48% of Enthusiast Gaming‚Äôs audience do not use Facebook. Altogether, the company has amassed an  audience with significant potential for monetization if it is able to  execute on its strategies over the coming years.

Today, Enthusiast  has 110k+ subscribers, mostly from The Sim's Resource, and this number is up 50% YTD, generating slightly less than $2mil in revenue per  quarter. While management has rolled out subscriptions across a few individual  properties like The Sims Resource, Escapist, and Siliconera, they are  working on putting together an integrated subscription that takes  advantage of their ownership across all these properties.

&#x200B;

>There‚Äôs a much bigger play that we can offer customers, and we are  spending a lot of time figuring out how to nail it. That‚Äôs our approach,  because nobody can offer, the things that we can offer. And so, we  think our best chance for transformative penetration and transformative  growth on the subscription side is an integrated offer.

&#x200B;

As one of the largest content creators in the gaming industry, with ownership of multiple YouTube  channels as well as esports team, it's only natural that Enthusiast  would enter the content licensing space. In the future, esports and  gaming content will replace a good chunk of sports and other content  available on OTT services today, in my opinion, as 60% of Gen Z people  prefer esports over traditional sports. Today, Enthusiast has already licensed out their BCC Gaming content to Samsung's OTT service, and there should be more deals done in the next few years.

After all these monetization streams, Enthusiast is also planning to  monetize through e-commerce and social networking. However, since this  is still several years out, management has not given much detail on  this.

&#x200B;

>And then, down the road, we have more focus on ecommerce and creating  a marketplace, as well as developing a social network, which we‚Äôre  pretty excited about.

In addition, recently acquired Omnia Media is a keystone in the YouTube  ecosystem, providing services to over 500 influencers, including  well-known influencers with millions of subscribers. Omnia Media also  owns its own YouTube channels like Wisecrack and BCC Gaming that produce original content.

Overall, gaming is  going to continue its strong growth and Enthusiast is well-positioned to  capitalize on this trend by helping to connect gamers around the world.  In addition, the company is expected to show strong growth over the  next few years yet its valuation is low compared to other gaming  leaders.

This is an important  demographic, since it is one of the hardest-to-reach ones, and is one  the demographics that spends the most on non-essential goods and has a  larger lifetime value, since they are in the early stages of their  lives. The CEO mentions how 70% of the company's audience is either Gen Z or Millennials, with 65% of its audience spending more than 15  hours a week gaming. 67% of its platform users purchase more than 7 video games every year. Referring back to the importance of this demographic because it is hard to reach; an astounding 48% of Enthusiast Gaming‚Äôs audience do not use Facebook. Altogether, the company has amassed an  audience with significant potential for monetization if it is able to  execute on its strategies over the coming years.

Today, Enthusiast  has 110k+ subscribers, mostly from The Sim's Resource, and this number is up 50% YTD, generating slightly less than $2mil in revenue per  quarter. While management has rolled out subscriptions across a few individual  properties like The Sims Resource, Escapist, and Siliconera, they are  working on putting together an integrated subscription that takes  advantage of their ownership across all these properties.

&#x200B;

>There‚Äôs a much bigger play that we can offer customers, and we are  spending a lot of time figuring out how to nail it. That‚Äôs our approach,  because nobody can offer, the things that we can offer. And so, we  think our best chance for transformative penetration and transformative  growth on the subscription side is an integrated offer.

&#x200B;

As one of the largest content creators in the gaming industry, with ownership of multiple YouTube  channels as well as esports team, it's only natural that Enthusiast  would enter the content licensing space. In the future, esports and  gaming content will replace a good chunk of sports and other content  available on OTT services today, in my opinion, as 60% of Gen Z people  prefer esports over traditional sports. Today, Enthusiast has already licensed out their BCC Gaming content to Samsung's OTT service, and there should be more deals done in the next few years.

After all these monetization streams, Enthusiast is also planning to  monetize through e-commerce and social networking. However, since this  is still several years out, management has not given much detail on  this.

&#x200B;

>And then, down the road, we have more focus on ecommerce and creating  a marketplace, as well as developing a social network, which we‚Äôre  pretty excited about.

&#x200B;

In addition, recently acquired Omnia Media is a keystone in the YouTube  ecosystem, providing services to over 500 influencers, including  well-known influencers with millions of subscribers. Omnia Media also  owns its own YouTube channels like Wisecrack and BCC Gaming that produce original content.

Overall, gaming is  going to continue its strong growth and Enthusiast is well-positioned to  capitalize on this trend by helping to connect gamers around the world.  In addition, the company is expected to show strong growth over the  next few years yet its valuation is low compared to other gaming  leaders.

For disclosure, I have not got any position in Enthusiast Gaming. Above are just snippets of the research I've been doing and what some analysts are saying. I would like to hear your opinion on this company too.

There has been zero evidence of naked shorting.  If you borrow shares to short a stock it is not naked shorting.  Failure to deliver does not necessarily mean naked shorting occurred. It can also occur if you sell your shares that your broker has loaned out and they cannot get the shares back in time for settlement.  Eventually the person they loaned them to has to close their position if they cannot locate other shares to return.  I bring up failure to deliver because that is what all the conspiracy minded people bring up as proof of naked shorting and GME had a high rate of failure to deliver (mainly because the volume was such a high % of the float at the same time the short interest was so high).  I am not saying that naked shorting doesn't happen but it does not happen as frequently as people on reddit think it does.

I got into Cruise stocks about March and April of last year. They've kind of stagnated awaiting for cruising to kick off again.

So I started exploring different airlines, looked at American and united, looks like United might be a better bet.

But to go along with the airlines, if they start flying, they're going to start ordering airplanes... So I chose to invest in things related to the purchase of new aircraft.  I chose to go after boeing, and whenever there's a few dollars left in my brokerage account, I buy a few shares of Rolls-Royce.

Boeing has had an order of f-15ex aircraft for the United States Air force, an order of f-15QA for the Qatar Air Force, an option exercised on 15 more refueling aircraft for the Air Force, and a contract for up to 60 commercial aircraft... Along with a bunch of maintenance and logistic contracts.

Rolls-Royce is in the running for the contract for re-engineing the B-52 aircraft, supposed to happen second half of this year. If they win that contract, should be 600 plus engines for that.

\- The strategy is **backtested** only to the beginning of 2020, but I'm working on it. It's got an **annualized return of 26%** (compared to 16% for the SP500)

\- **Max drawdown** of -8.7% (thought this was pretty interesting - W\*B would be a very cool hedge for financial markets at large. Rode COVID like a wave)

\- **Sharpe Ratio**: 2.22. Here's an [investopedia link](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharperatio.asp) for those of you that can read

\- Profit-Loss ratio of 3.48.

\- Avg win of 0.85%

\- Avg loss of -0.24%. The fact that this number's absolute value is lower than average win is a good thing

&#x200B;

Anyways, invested around $60k in January myself, I'm at around $90k rn. Not one of my main investment vehicles, and maybe not the smartest investment, but I make myself feel better by telling myself it's smarter than Y\*LOing on puts.

It is evident that since the pandemic began, enthusiasm for having these stocks has skyrocketed. There are several reasons for this that make sense, including increasing earnings, but a large component is speculative fervor on the part of new tech- and gaming-happy investors, IMO. Keep in mind that these companies likely enjoyed increased profits because of the stay-at-home lifestyle as of late, and it's hard to imagine that the trends will continue upward at a similar rate as the pandemic wanes. It's not as if people are buying new GTX's or processors every year. You could say that these companies, particularly NVDA, are priced for perfection. There's simply not much juice left to squeeze out of them at this point, IMO. That's why I would just wait for a better opportunity.

Like all market manias, the present one will end eventually, either dreadfully slow or with a violent bang, and the stocks hyped up the most are the ones most vulnerable to loss as enthusiasm turns into fear.",,

Next, you use that XYZ$100 to purchase a share of ABC.ETF, conveniently priced at XYZ$100 per share (or, equivalently, US$100 per share).

Suppose that, for various economic reasons, the exchange rate falls to US$1 = XYZ$2 over the time during which you hold your share of ABC.ETF. 

Let's say the value of a share of ABC.ETF  increases to US$150. Due to the currency exchange rate, that share is now worth US$150 \* (XYZ$2 / US$1) = XYZ$300. Because you not exposed to XYZ$, the nominal value of your investment tripled.

What if the value of a share of ABC.ETF had dropped to US$75, losing a quarter of its value relative to US currency? It would be worth US$75 \* (XYZ$2 / US$1) = XYZ$150. Even though the value of your investment fell relative to the US$, the nominal value of your investment still increased in XYZ$, because you were sheltered from currency fluctuations while invested in ABC.ETF.
