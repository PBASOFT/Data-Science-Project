But if it’s an ape that keeps flinging its poop at me because it can’t think critically every time I ask a question then I won’t trust that ape and will expect poop in the face every time instead of something nice like a gorilla nest to sleep in and bananas. But if that ape ever asks me for help or asks a serious question I will do my best not to let that ape down, poop in the face be damned :)

Also the squeeze I was referring to was GME/AMC if you check when I made my account you will see it looked at that time like the squeeze was over. I had no idea that we were starting round two and I wasn’t looking at the charts.

I’m currently enrolled in a MBA and I’m looking for some advice on an assignment in my microeconomics module. Essentially I’ve been asked to give my analysis and hypothesis of an excel spreadsheet that contains customer deposits for a brokerage firm. This spreadsheet contains two columns (sum and net deposits) that I am to base my calculations on.

I’m attempting to calculate assets under management (image 1). The professor has provided the formula for this however I’m unsure how to calculate market movements. I know the definition for market movements varies between subject and company so I’m unsure of how to approach this.

Can anyone tell me how to calculate market movements based off the columns in image 2? 

Any help would be greatly appreciated 🙏

But your professor wants to know how sensitive the investors are to an aum contraction of 20%. Will you be hit with redemptions?  Or will they stay with you. So I think what they want you to do is look at the monthly data and see how much money is taken out of your fund when the market drops. Some clients may stick with you at 10%. Some 20% down. Some 30% down. Etc. I’d look at the data set you have and see if you can figure that out. But note that in the example, if aum is down 20%, net deposits will be down and so each client will withdraw less than he or she put in.

Over time through the good and bad, compare how that portion of your portfolio does to those. They don’t always make drastic large gains, but they generally keep gradually going up over time. It’s just a way to keep yourself honest.  

I wouldn’t say companies like Tesla is established. They just barely turned a profit for the first time. People are excited about it for what it could be in 5 or 10 years. Intel, apple, Microsoft, JP Morgan chase…. Those are established and been turning solid profits for awhile. They might not make as huge gains and most of the time will be less volatile.

This is basically on historicals how the major brokerages have eliminated commission trades and how RH makes it's money (paying for order flow).

Right now, the company PRINTS cash and is profitable, bonus points. 

But coinbase only makes money by how often people trade, and if everyone keeps predicting that BTC will be a store of wealth, then then need to trade it is very minimal, especially as the price gets higher and higher.

This same principle of the price being high also lives in the current stock market since some companies like a high stock price to avoid massive volatility in the market.

Besides just their core competency, they just announced the launch of a media arm, though not sure how well that will turn out. As you can see from the stock price today, investors didn't take it so well.

I've actually stayed away from buying and even considered shorting, though this was back at the $330 level. Right now, for my own PA, I've decided to sit on the sidelines.",,

Everything I claim to be sure of, I say with the knowledge that just because I’m “sure” doesn’t mean I’m right. I hold this philosophy with all my beliefs, not just financials. 

With that out of the way, it is _my_ belief that a lot of the big banks are wayyyy fucking over leveraged, and are also using really risky assets as collateral. So basically 2008 but instead of the mortgage backed securities contributing to that cluster fuck it’s commercial mortgage backed securities this time around. 

There’s also a lot of fucky shorting going on with treasury bonds but I’m not even going to try and go into that because it goes even higher over my head than the CMBS issue does, and I think at this point it’s obvious I’m not an expert. 

Oh yea and GameStop is shorted to fucking oblivion and when it pops citadel is going to be liquidated and that’s going to lead to a temporary market crash. 

In summary: big banks have been fucking around, and they’re about to find out. Of course, I’m sure the middle and lower class are gonna get the shitty end of the stock as always. 

P.S. I’m not trying to convince you of anything, so if you don’t believe me about any of the comments I made, particularly regarding GameStop, I kinda... don’t care? Not to be mean, I just have my opinions, my current investments represent those opinions, and now I’m strapped in waiting for the show to start.

It seems that it is too lucrative for the market makers (or maybe it was broker) to act like they have the shares available to lend out when in fact they do not. So the shares truly never existed.

\- I own Coinbase shares and am long term bullish on the stock.

\- I have no other affiliation or non-public knowledge of Coinbase.

Here is a comparison of basic metrics between Coinbase, Paypal, and Square. I picked Paypal and Square because they offer minimal crypto services and are at least in the money/finance/payements ecosystem. It is hard to find something to directly compare to Coinbase. A standard brokerage/exchange would work, but most of those are established and do not fit the high growth profile(Fidelity, Schwab, etc.). When RobinHood or SoFi are fully public and have at least one full quarter or more of results they would be better comparisons.

                      Coinbase  Paypal  Square
    Price/Sales(ttm): 41.58     12.70   7.68
    Price/Book(mrq):  33.73     14.77   39.93
    Forward P/E:      28.90     53.76   140.85

Coinbase is highly valued. Whether it is overvalued is in the eye of the beholder. Most high growth companies have crazy metrics for years, pick one at random and look at their historical values. 

I will say that the P/S and P/B values are worrisome. Those ratios will require a minimum 2-3x expansion to bring down to Paypal levels(which itself has high ratios). Coinbase is particularly hampered by its dependence on transaction fees. Coinbase compares better to Square, but Square itself is a high growth and highly speculative company with its own growth issues.

Coinbase will perform well in the short term. However in that short term and contrary to performance I expect the share price to fall by half or more in the next 6 months, settling around $100-125 before starting back up as multiple quarterly results come in and Coinbase continues to outperform.

That performance will be contingent on Coinbase adopting an aggressive strategy over the next 12-24 months that expands beyond transaction fees for primary revenue:

1.  Carefully select and groom debut crypto releases

Coinbase will seek out or even develop new crypto assets to debut on Coinbase. These selected cryptos will have short term exclusivity periods where they can only be traded on Coinbase. Expect any unique features of these cryptos to be fully supported by Coinbase(and possibly only by Coinbase).

2. Offer smart contract and block chain powered derivatives services

Imagine crypto assets that mirror real world assets or other digital assets with Coinbase as the exchange or clearing house. The Mirror Protocol is designed for this and there are other blockchain initiatives to do the same. Such mirrored blockchain assets could facilitate an entire shadow equities derivative market, or real estate, or anything that can be captured by the blcokchain. I'm sure someone will say this can be done without Coinbase(or other authority) but at the end of the day people always seek out something reliable, something certified, something safe, and Coinbase will be the well known crypto/blockchain service that can do that.

3. Acquisitions

Coinbase has cash and is raising more, like the recent effort to raise $1.25 billion in senior notes. I expect some of this cash and possibly future offers will be used to acquire competitors or entities with unique crypto/blockchain technologies.

4. Expand tradeable assets with curated crypto selections

For the last few months Coinbase has been almost frozen adding very few new crypto assets to its tradeable list. I believe Coinbase has been holding its breath during the IPO, trying to keep everything as static as possible to avoid any missteps. Now that the IPO is past, expect a rush of new assets to be added. In fact this has already started, with the addition of a half dozen new cryptos in the past two weeks. Coinbase is unlikely to ever have the large lists of Binance, Bithumb, KuCoin, etc., but it will counter that all of its choices are carefully curated for value, security, and longevity.

5. Timed trading fee reductions

As the features above roll out, expect Coinbase to offer targeted and heavily advertised reductions in its fee structure. This will counter pressure from other exchanges and, depending on the scope of the reductions, reverse effects and apply pressure to the other exchanges.

If Coinbase can do some or most of the above, they will maintain their first mover advantage and achieve lasting dominance in the market.

(Oh and I can't justify or prove any of this, but this is what I would do as Coinbase)",,

All that being said, I “feel” like I’m getting a better deal via DCA and I’m good with that. :)",,

I am writing you at this late hour because I was just able to calm my mother down from having a panick attack from the thought of us not having a steady check coming in. We are a check away from living on the street.  Cause you see part of my earnings go to help my mother pay her ""Reverse Mortgage""... Which is already a task in itself.  She has just been warned that if she can't update her homeowners/flood insurance that they will have no choice but to take the house.  My mother is ""81"" and had one steady Check a month that barely covers her food and medications.  It just baffles my mind how the mistake by a ""Wells Fargo"" employee can change a Families life?!??!!  This has been a travesty... And I know ALL YOU WANT IS NUMBERS... JUST NUMBERS! BUT THE PURE SLIGHT OF A WELLS FARGOS EMPLOYEES WRIST CANNOT EVEN BE CLOSE TO QUANTIFIABLE ON HOW WELLS FARGO HAS CHANGED OUR LIVES! NOW I WILL GET YOU MY LICENSE TESTING DATES/ PRICE OF TESTING. PRICE OF TESTING EXAM MATERIAL, PRICE OF CLASSES I TOOK, TRAVEL TO AND FROM CLASS AND TESTING. AND ALSO MY APPLICATIONS THAT I HAVE SUBMITTED FOR UNEMPLOYMENT FOR THE 1ST TIME. Physician APPOINTMENTS MISSED. MEDICATIONS MISSED. MEDICATIONS STOLEN ETC ... BUT ONCE AGAIN ""MY TIME"" IS WHAT SHOULD BE QUANTIFIABLE !!  IF WELLS FARGO DROPS THE BALL ON ThIS, Than we absolutely have to get the word out!  This is exactly what we are seeing in today's society with the ""Blue collar""... Working to progress... Especially ""AFRICAN AMERICAN"" FAMILY TRYING TO TREAD WATER AND SHOOT FOR MIDDLE CLASS.... AND A CORP SUCH AS WELLS FARGO INCORPORATED... HANDS A CHECK FOR $500 AND Wink/Nod tells then to sit down and shut up in so mY word.  If you have a better scenario, I would love to see how you apply terms!!  


Do the Tight Thing Wells Fargo!!!

437,,2021-05-19 05:02:31,t3_nfwlag,,StockMarket,"**These is pure my though process here.** 

 

Pipe investor shorting the stock. 

Short interest info: https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/IPOE/short-interest/

Current IPOE short shares: 25,463,687	 based on fintel.io 

&#x200B;

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pipe investor will get rough 120 M SOFI shares after the merger. 

Pipe investor cost of 1 share = $10 

&#x200B;

**(Doing some math )** 

Merge file date in SEC: 2021-01-11 

Date diff with today = 128 days 

(this numbers are my assumption , feel free to change )

Average price = 16 

Average Borrow rate of  90%

Average daily interest = average price / (borrowing rate \* 365 days in year )

= 16 / ( 90% \* 365)

= 0.0487 

&#x200B;

|Average short hold duration|Est interest paid per 1 short share |total cost |
|:-|:-|:-|
|120|0.0487 \* 120 = 5.844|10 +  5.844 = 15.844|
|90|0.0487 \* 90 = 4.383|10 + 4.383 = 14.383|
|60|0.0487 \* 60 = 2.922|10 + 2.922 = 12.922|
|30|0.0487 \* 30 = 1.461|10+1.461 = 11.261|

&#x200B;

Average short shares volume for last 128 days=  20,000,000 

Interest paid so far = 20,000,000 \* (128 \*   0.0487 ) =  $124,672,000 

Pipe total cost = total pipe shares \* cost price  

= 120,000,000 \* $10 = $ 1,200,000,000

&#x200B;

Total cost =  $124,672,000  +  $124,672,000 =  $1,324,672,000

Average cost of the stock =  $11

So based on this Pipe investor will make $4 in profit if the price stay at 15.

&#x200B;

This played would have worked if the following scenario didn't happen

1) SPAC bubble crashed forced the price from high 20's to trade in 18-14 range. This drastically reduced their profit margin. To liquidate half their shares they will need at least 5 trading days which can drop the price below the cost , therefore selling at loss . The loss would have been reduced if the price had stayed in the high 20's since they have a higher price range to take their profit from.  Put options can be used to compensated their loss but that just adds to their cost of the stock. 

2) SEC change the process of filling SPAC which caused additional 60 days.  This forced additional cost . they had to pay for 60 additional days of interest plus additional PUT to play safe. PUT have a limited  profit range.

Based on this info it makes more sense for Pipe investors to cover their short position now so that they can raise this price.  This will give them a higher price range on merge date to liquidate their shares.",nfwlag,Pipe investor shorting IPOE. Can we squeeze them?

443,,2021-05-19 05:10:19,t3_nfwqnk,,StockMarket,"Halfway through 2021, retail investing has reached a peak volume we have never seen before. In fact, the average amount of trades happening each day has more than doubled since 2019. Trillions of dollars are moved as stocks rise and fall throughout the day. However, even though stock prices change at all hours, US retail traders are restricted to the narrow timeframe of 9:30 AM through 4:00 PM EST.

The restrictive trading hours placed upon retail traders is just one of the many issues with the current system. Some of the other problems have been brought to attention due to recent events, such as the meteoric rise of GameStop stock and Dogecoin. In both cases, many different stock brokerages used by retail traders restricted the buying or selling of specific securities, effectively manipulating the market.

Time and time again we have seen larger investment institutions place rules and regulations on ordinary traders, while giving themselves the freedom to do whatever they want. Our goal? Level the playing field.

**Our vision**

The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) represents a massive amount of wealth and equity. It has a market cap of 26.2 trillion dollars and is easily the largest stock exchange on the planet. However, if you’re able to freely trade with all the stocks within the NYSE, you’re still only able to trade with roughly a third of the global stocks.

There are dozens of other stock exchanges out there using dozens of different currencies. However, the time-zone and currency differences make accessibility difficult. We see a world where anyone can trade on any stock exchange, regardless of their currency, at any time they wish. At first glance, it may seem idealistic, or a far reach. But in reality? It’s already here.

**What is StockSwap?**

StockSwap is the stock market reimagined, with the power of investing held equally by all parties for the first time in history.

On StockSwap, you can purchase any stock you want, just like on any other platform, but without any of the restrictions.

**How does it work?**

StockSwap is possible through the developments of cryptocurrencies and blockchains over the past several years. When you buy a stock on StockSwap, you are exchanging your money for a wrapped cryptocurrency token that is directly tied to and backed by your desired stock, purchased by us. This means you retain voting rights, receive dividends, and keep any other benefit of directly owning the stock yourself.

**How can I start?**

If everything you’ve read so far sounded appealing, that’s fantastic. But while we’d like our platform to be perfect, we’re not quite there yet. Before you can start trading with us, there’s a few things you should know.

**Where are we now**

As we work towards perfecting StockSwap, all trades have a 1% fee placed on them, capping at $10 to help cover our developmental and maintenance costs. We understand nobody wants to pay money to invest and are working on further reducing those fees as we progress, with our ideal scenario consisting of phasing them out completely in the near future.

In addition, while StockSwap is already developed and fully functional, we are still finishing the process of obtaining our broker dealer license. Before completing this step, SEC regulations require the investment portfolio of any potential client to be greater than 10 million USD. This means, while we’re currently serving several dozen clients, it’ll be at least a few more weeks before we’re able to able to help everybody trade freely.

Until then, keep up to date on our progress through our medium and telegram pages. We can’t wait for you to join us on our journey as we reimagine how we invest.

Until next time!",nfwqnk,StockSwap - Investing reimagined

To my utmost disappointment , I hereby declare ,that I chose this auspicious day to begin my journey into the world of crypto. I decided to put in around 10k INR this morning , and dude, am I in a state of ""Numb"".

Anyways , I put in the amount knowing that I don't care even if all is lost. 

I knew this kind of crash could happen ,but not that it would happen in a few hours. 

Lesson: Always stick to what you understand, stocks are always wiser choice since they are based on businesses unlike crypto which really doesn't have anything to back it up(no intrinsic value- cryptos aren't really producing anything which can be consumed).

Secondly  , if a tweet can affect the prices of crypto, are they really functioning as decentralised .

Thirdly , I do think that no government would like to give up control or power, this control is always dependent on money ,which again the govt owns or creates, the government's across the world would never give this away to some decentralised currency . Even if it accepts it for shorter term, the government's would again discard this concept as a whole.

Lastly , never think of crypto as an investment , a gamble would be more apt ,tbh",ng6wnr,Crypto investment

That said, I tried to do my part in expressing concern to today’s retail investors who are skipping doing their due diligence, instead choosing to rather listen and follow these so called “industry greats” (Musk, Chammath, Wood, Cuban, etc). Cathie Wood, for instance, every big purchases she has made (PLTR, TSLA, COIN) has all resulted in huge losses for her portfolio... Maybe on long term, things will turn out positively for her portfolios.. Or it could simply get worse.

The point is, stop listening or following these so-called loud mouths.. Rather do your own research and put your money where your intelligent research leads you.. 

It’s terrible and scary to see, given today’s stock market condition, that fundamental-driven investing is becoming a thing of the past. Wealth can’t be accomplished through emotional-driven investing.

Amidst all these chaos, it is interesting to see dividend stocks are still performing far well.. That tells you fundamental-investing is still far better.

As regular-income Indians we don't get to play with money man. We get what we get as salaries and we use investment instruments that can get the returns above inflation (atleast over 6%) along with some tax benefits and we stay happy with that.

1. Free trades
2. Fractional shares 
3. Dollar cost averaging
4. Reinvesting dividends 
5. Minimal fees for transferring entire portfolio. 
6. Day trades available 

I starting using stash several years ago and my portfolio there has grown quite a bit. It’s pretty diversified but I feel it’s time to move on from this beginners platform. I’ve really really enjoyed using it though. I’m tired of the delayed selling of shares and overall slowness of the platform, however I totally understand it’s built for long term investing which is why they do this. This is my strategy as well, long term investing, but if I want to sell something  I want to sell it quickly with the amount of money I have involved. 

I dollar cost mostly, depositing a certain amount into each stock, etf, etc. Weekly. This is very important to me as it keeps me from trying to “day trade” completely with my limited experience. 

I do also use Robinhood and WeBull but want to keep those accounts separate.

Since the last outlook the price of ZKIN has failed to impress as it has dropped by 8%.

As the price of ZKIN failed to found support at $4.80, while being pushed down by a downtrend line, the price broke to the downside.

The price immediately dipped to good known support at $4.50, from where it has bounce back above $4.80, however these gains failed to sustain above $4.80.

As the bounce got denied, the price of ZKIN continued to fall and went for a test of support at $4.50. 

It has found some decent support at this level, but with continuous tests of this level, it has eventually led to a breakdown on which we are currently looking at.

So where is the price headed?

As of where the price stands right now, it's located on a trend line support so it should move higher from here.

Speaking about support, current support is located at $4.30, where ZKIN has to find support in order to not fall any lower. Makes sense doesn't it.

Let indicators help us.

RSI suggests a slight bullish divergence, but it's about to break below 40, pushing bearish momentum to play. 

MACD wave indicator says that we are currently in the second long selling wave. These waves are pretty overextended and we look for a corrective buying wave to ride the price to at least to $4.80 soon.

Unfortunately the overall short term trend has changed into a downtrend as the 20 EMA crossed below the 50 one.",ng8570,ZKIN 15m Outlook

**SPY Results:**

First thing I notice is that periods of high variance returns are not sustained and they look possibly isolated, although there minor spikes before each big one.

https://preview.redd.it/l2yatqsul1071.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=b664fb6a57f07680d9b86167772bca88c3c162ef

On the other hand it looks like medium variance and low variance are in a constant switch off. We can see the almost perfect inversion between low variance probabilities and medium.

https://preview.redd.it/i66bouqzl1071.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=466d9c41642eed0ecd25a20fbe401151f3357afa

Most of those high variance returns come from changes from low to high variance. 

https://preview.redd.it/ocno00v4m1071.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=f814841b4894078e9f5ebed0d92ff4b82596b783

This shows that high variance returns are more like *surprises* in the market because they come from low variance returns, its not a gradual buildup.  

**QQQ results**

QQQ’s results are very similar to SPY’s results. 

*Processing img jcewv8lam1071...*

It seems like there are not *precursor* spikes in high variance returns, and the occur in isolation.  In this case it does seem like there is a sustained period of high variance returns in the early 2000s.  

*Processing img yosxpjwem1071...*

The same cyclical inverse pattern occurs within the low and medium level regimes.

https://preview.redd.it/5rft212km1071.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7f65cfe89297a9e30ed22fe274a72ddb13fe31a

And consistent with SPY it seems like high variance regime spikes come from low variance to high variance.

https://preview.redd.it/pystbr0om1071.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ca5e2cc342b50eecdd92965ed85d3a0feb44e8c

**Conclusions / Future areas to investigate**

· In CBOE VIX data is was common for large spikes in high variance to come from medium variance regimes, that does not seem to be the case for SPY or QQQ most of the high variance spikes come from changes from low variance to high variance

· Both QQQ and SPY exhibited what look like to be an inverse relationship between low and medium variance regimes. Confirming results and possibly making indicators could be comparing covariances and trends between the time series and then if a there is a *shift* that is probably a *break* in the relationship which probably leads to a time of high variance

· QQQ did exhibit high variance regime for a longer sustained time and that may be because of its growth-orientation.

 I hope to turn the codebase into a python-only repo so I can analyze the time series in a notebook a publish more of my findings.

I was only pointing out that the price of lumber has been increasing for actually quite a long time, even before the inflation topic was coming up. Now it's just accelerated with inflation AND a lack of supply.

>To understand how inflation works, imagine a world that only has two commodities: oranges picked from orange trees and paper money printed by the government. In a drought year when oranges are scarce, one would expect to see the price of oranges rise, because quite a few dollars would be chasing very few oranges. Conversely, if there was a record orange crop, one would expect to see the price of oranges fall because orange sellers would need to reduce their prices in order to clear their inventory.

# Overview 

The era of clean energy is upon us and the timing couldn’t be better to get behind Joe Biden’s newly proposed [2.3 trillion dollar](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/us/politics/biden-climate-plan.html) clean energy infrastructure plan. Clean energy generation is about to ride some huge tailwinds as described by this article on Financial Times.

“Biden’s plan would see an infusion of more than $350bn directly into clean energy driving electric-vehicle infrastructure, reinvigorating the grid and boosting research and development plus an estimated $400bn extending and expanding tax credits for clean energy generation and storage. It would also set a clean energy standard mandating utilities to produce power that is carbon-free by 2035.”

**Transition to Clean Energy, the Solar Industry, and Enphase**

One industry already seeing increased demand as the world shifts to clean energy is solar. In the last decade alone, solar has experienced an average annual growth rate of **42%** ([source](https://www.seia.org/solar-industry-research-data#:~:text=Solar%2520as%2520an%2520Economic%2520Engine,investment%2520in%2520the%2520American%2520economy.)). Solar is currently regarded as the cheapest source of energy in the history of the world, far surpassing coal and gas, as well as beat out wind and other renewables.

Let’s talk about one of the biggest players currently dominating this industry, Enphase (ENPH). Enphase is the largest designer and manufacturer in the solar energy market selling micro-inverters for homes, installing solar panels onto their roofs, and currently capturing over 50% of the U.S market. Enphase’s strategy revolves around four core pillars: new product development (innovating the micro-inverter), residential energy storage, commercial solar projects, and services platform.

By executing the strategies mentioned above they are expecting to increase their Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM) from $4.1 billion in 2020 to roughly \~$14 billion in 2023. All of this is powered by organic growth and the new clean energy movement providing margins of roughly 40% which are worthy enough to write home about.

**Setbacks**

Like any industry or company, there will be some challenging obstacles to overcome. For Enphase, one of their biggest hurdles is the global semiconductor chip-shortage, which should give some headwinds until at least the end of 2021. The chip-shortage is not a new headline and has been plaguing many industries. On Enphase’s recent earnings call management noted that although demand remains strong they can’t fill orders because there isn’t enough material for them to keep up with demand. However, these are short term headwinds and the global semiconductor chip shortage is not expected to continue forever. Thus, this represents an excellent buying opportunity for ENPH. In a RARE occurrence even Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, AND Barclays [all agreeing on one thing](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/28/enphase-posts-record-quarter-stock-slides-on-chip-shortage-pains.html) that was recommending buying the recent Enphase dip.

“The silver lining is obvious to us: those looking to take the long-view on ENPH will correctly view this eventually transient headwind, as a buying opportunity on any weakness,” noted Barclays, while Goldman said that “demand and margins remain robust.”

**Final Thoughts**

Enphase’s dominance in this industry has allowed them to capture a large piece of this ever-growing pie. Their flagship product is still innovating with each iteration while they expand commercial and residential offerings. Their SAM is expecting to grow exponentially over the next 5-10 years and ENPH is aggressively (and succeeding) trying to capture ever dollar of it. The stock has tumbled from all-time-highs, which leaves some breathing room for a good entry since their valuation has contracted.",ng8pre,The weekly DD - This week's edition is Enphase energy (ENPH): Powering the Future

 SANTA CLARA, Calif., May 19, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- [AMD](https://www.amd.com/) (NASDAQ: AMD) today announced that its Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program. Under this program, the company intends to repurchase up to $4 billion of outstanding AMD common stock. AMD expects to fund repurchases through cash generated from operations which have been strengthened by the company’s strong operational results.  


“Today’s announcement reflects our confidence in AMD’s business and the successful execution of our multi-year growth strategy,” said Dr. Lisa Su, AMD president and CEO. “Our strong financial results and growing cash generation enable us to invest in the business and begin returning capital to our shareholders.”

Under this program, which is designed to return value to AMD stockholders, offset dilution from stock issuances, and reduce share count over time, the company will repurchase stock in the open market. This repurchase program has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.",ngaw32,AMD Announces $4 Billion Share Repurchase Program

Zoom out to the day/month timeline. 

That a look at the RSI it stands for Retard Strength Index. 

Buy when the RSI is at the bottom. Sell when RSI is at the top. I typically buy position when it hits one of the EMA/SMA. I Zoom out to see if it trending to hit the 200-day moving average or the 50day EMA. I Buy when it hits one of those meaning.

All this to say I buy the dip after the dip dips. Sometimes it dips some more but then it bounces. Haven’t had one go under the 200 day moving average.
