42,,2021-05-25 13:55:40,t3_nkqbtm,,StockMarket,"Amazon's latest movement is an acquisition of MGM holdings for $9 billion. That would be the biggest acquisition since Whole Foods. We believe it would be the key growth catalysis for its Amazon Prime subscription and possibly impact deeply into its advertisement business.

**What is Metro Goldwyn Mayer, Inc. - MGM**

https://preview.redd.it/bbpcu3nvu9171.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=70a005edee2d9e4202999eac2a53c89eb66ca8db

If you don't recall what MGM is, the photo above should ring some bells by now. MGM is one of Hollywood's most famous movie producers, with its lion logo at the beginning of every movie that they made. It includes James Bond, Rocky, recently Tomb Raider, and A Star is Born.

&#x200B;

For most people, that means if the e-commerce giant successfully acquires MGM, all those movies will be on Amazon Prime Video on demand. It is good for all those prime users, including myself.

**What Does It Mean To An Investor**

https://preview.redd.it/cjegnzmzu9171.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e5ff2bdd7a6915615c340b50545f72cdaea5bff

Amazon already has Prime Video, why they still need to buy another one you might ask. It buys talented movie makers instead of buying a company. However, this pandemic gave both Amazon and MGM a second thought. For MGM, they are unable to release movies in theaters. In fact, they have already sold some of their movies to streaming services. The pandemic hit the movie industry very badly. On the other hand, Amazon has a hard time making some successful movie in-house. If you don’t believe it, can you name one movie that it has made? Still, they are one of the biggest streaming service providers.

**Amazon Prime**

https://preview.redd.it/9m1581i3v9171.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=837149ff148ec751bf413bda5d03fa8fb3149a74

In 2021, there are around 150 million Amazon Prime users in the US, and most of the people join the membership because it offers free one-day shipping locally. This is followed by the second is for the Amazon Prime Video. It's total revenue for the quarter ending 31 March 2021 was almost $110 billion, over 40% increased year over year. If all 150 million Prime members stayed for one year, it contributed over 17 billion. That would be 15% of the company's total revenue. If more than half of the people join Prime because of its streaming service, we believe the acquisition of MGM would boost the Prime subscription number to a new high.

The $9 billion seems too much for acquiring a company studio. However, if you compared the $11 billion spent on video and music content in 2019; the cost of the first season Lord of the Rings series ($465 million), the acquisition now would be considered as a very good deal for Amazon.

**The Advertisement Network**

Compared with Facebook or Google, the Amazon advertisement network is still very small. However, the potential is hard to ignore. Amazon's advertisement business is generating nearly $7 billion in just a quarter and it keeps growing, it is nearly 80% growth from last year. MGM not only put movies into the theater, but it also has a global-based TV network. The acquisition of MGM would give amazon the tool to test out their advertising serving or targeting capabilities and reach more potential Amazon Prime users worldwide.

**Amazon Web Services - AWS**

For most people, Amazon is just an e-commerce company. However, every investor should know, it is much more than that. Amazon Web Services, also known as AWS, is the biggest cloud service provider worldwide. In fact, this website is being hosted on AWS. AWS delivered over $13 billion in revenue, contributing over 12% of the total revenue. Amazon Prime Video is steaming from AWS which means it can also help Amazon to lower the taxable income by deducting the cost of using AWS services. However, we believe the cloud services growth rate would be slower, yet AWS would remain the dominant company of cloud computing services.

**Overweight**

Amazon is gaining more share in e-commerce due to the pandemic. The cloud services would be the new cash cow, money-making machine, and the Prime Video is believed to drive the Prime subscription number to a new high.",nkqbtm,My thought about Amazon MGM acquisition

I don't agree with the ""better hurry up and buy now"" or ""don't try to time the market"" sentiment at all. I mean, timing the market is just what we sometimes do. We have to try, or else we can end up hoping on or off the ride at the worst possible time. I think the point is to not obsess over timing it perfectly.

In my area, people are overbidding and waiving inspections, but realtors are feeding the fire because- newsflash!- they're sales people! When realtors collectively tell buyers that ""it's a sellers market, and you'd better step up your game, and *blah blah blah*,"" they're doing what their brokers have taught them to do.

Brokers know exactly what they're doing when they do this. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy because, even if you are a savvy buyer that knows realtors are generally full of shit, the next buyer may not be all that smart. If even one other buyer is a fool, guess what price and overall standard you have to beat now to play ball? A *fool's* price and standard.

**Caveat and disclaimer:** I hate sales people. I hate realtors. And I especially hate brokers. I have a long list of damned good reasons, but still, I am biased. If you want an honest opinion about real estate, get a lawyer, or just do your own research. This is just my opinion.",,

I want to empathize though that a lot of it is theory and the only thing we can almost guarantee is that the new level of short sellers (and note, having short sellers is nothing special, that's normal for almost all stocks or...anything) is way higher. The numbers I use try to explain reality, but as it should be obvious I have no insight in when they bought, how much they bought etc. So here is my previous comment:

&#x200B;

It will go exactly the same way it did the last time - the big and leading investor will turn 100k+ into millions and the little retail ones will pay for it. The following is a warning to the people that just blindly follow. You can definitely gamble and win, but at least be reasonable enough what you enter.  
  
The main difference is to have the same effect as it had last time you'd need to reach the same short interest with the same 15 times leverage and not to forget your starting point is now not 10-20$ but 167$.  
  
Let's assume they are stupid enough to actually leverage their short positions still as strong with 15 times (which is insanely unlikely after many got burned, though even more hedgies made a ton of money on it), the positions are this time way smaller (makes sense, you can buy way more positions on 10$ than you can on 167$). Let's keep it simple and just say that the position is now 15 times smaller in amount of shares, but same in value (it would be 16.7 times, but as I said, simple).  
  
We will also assume the main short positions were previously at 20$, which is really generous considering the year started at 17$ and it went down to \~7$ in it's history. To understand why this is really important you have to take about margin requirements, interest and leverage, but again I'll keep it simple because all of these things would make it worse for the retail investor to cause a second squeeze. If you didn't realize it already, everything I put together so far is put into high favor of the retail investor, meaning if the following sounds unlikely or even impossible to happen, then just imagine how unlikely it actually is without a favor.  
  
The main squeeze happened previously assumed at 350$ and 150$, at both cases a massive volume went into GME while buying was restricted on most retail brokers. In the first case it reached 500$, in the second case it reached back to 350$. The 150 to 350 jump was by far more significant and most likely the majority of the squeeze. That means the squeeze was achieved with a difference of 150-20=130$. To achieve the same effect on 167$ starting position you would need to reach 297$. This sounds very achievable, doesn't it? Except that the 297$ assumes the same amount is shorted than it was on 20$, which obviously isn't the case. While the same amount of money could have went in, the positions are way less, meaning the losses are way less. So let's go back to get 15 times smaller positions I mentioned before. Just in case someone can't follow:  
  
If you short Gamestop for 1000$ at a share price of 20$, you have 50 open positions. If the price now goes to 40$, then your positions are at -20$, per position. That means you are down 1000$ as a hedge fund. Now we amplify this by the 15 leverage that was reported on these positions and those 50 positions are now a loss of -15,000$. Sounds small but don't forget I only used 50 open positions (as in, 50 shorted shares), while reality was way beyond millions. What you should actually look at that their position of 1000$ now lost them 15,000$, and that while the share price was only at 40$. For 150$ that's a loss of 130$ per share, or 50x130=6500, times 15 for the leverage, is 97,500$ in losses. On only 50 shorted shares. And not to forget, these have interest to a certain extend (usually big accounts pay way less interest or even no interest if they don't require margin to hold up the position).  
  
Now that we talked about what happened we have to talk about what needs to happen here for the same effect. We will use the same example to make it clear for everyone, but instead of using 20$ as a share price it's now 167$ and the same 1000$ used. When you open a short position now worth 1000$ in total, that's only 6 open positions. That's it. Not like the 50 before. While the same money is used, it costs now way more. But if the same money is used, does this matter? Let's play it through. In the first example above this we went from 20$ to 40$, so let's go up 20$ now. We reach 187$, a loss of 20$ per share. 6x20=120, 15 times leverage = 1,800$. That's it. Before we had a loss of -15,000$, now it would only be a loss of 1,800$. That means to reach the same level we had before, you have to adjust for the difference in amount, so let's do that. We can't force them to buy more, so all you can do is aim for a higher stock price that the loss for the 1000$ investment in both examples is the same. Oh and of course that's not for the case of a 20$ difference, at 40$ nothing happened. What we care about is the 150$ (which is again in favor of the investor the lowest point possible to compare with, a real point would rather be 300-350$ which would make it way more impossible to achieve).  
  
If you couldn't follow, our goal is to calculate what cost the share price has to reach that the 6 positions at 167$ have an impact as strong as the 50 positions at 20$. This on it's own means nothing, but once you get to that territory there is a high chance history repeats, unless they learned and improved their strategy.  
  
Let's add together what we know:  
  
\-We need to reach a price of 297$ to be in the same price difference as previously  
  
\-Since way less shares were shorted now, we have to make up to reach the same loss by increasing the share price, since we can't force them to use more capital to open more positions  
  
We take the 6500$ in losses we had in the first example pre-leverage (since we care about the stock price) and now divide it by 6, the new amount of positions we were able to open at a price of 167. That comes down to 1083.33$ you have to reach as a LOSS, not share price. For the share price we have to add the 167 cost on top since that's the starting point, so 1250$.  
  
If you didn't follow this, here is the TL&DR explanation: For a hedge fund to see the same amount of losses, assuming the position size is the same but quantity is less due to way higher price, the stock GME would need to reach a price of 1250$.  
  
There are many factors that have to be considered here:  
  
1: While there is a world that exactly the same mistakes were done, it's very unlikely  
  
2: They already played dirty the last time, if it would get to the point again that will repeat but way worse, probably also with way less media coverage because they learned their lessons to get better at playing their own game  
  
3: The 1250$ is a real low role. The main reason for that is that the assumption is the same investment, but after some hedge funds got burned badly there is a high chance new short positions are way smaller. My entire example was with the same amount of money used, but that's very unlikely.  
  
4: The main reason the squeeze was so succesfull was the 15 times leverage used, amplifying everything by a shit ton. Yet again I would be highly surprised if they did the same amount again. Even just a reduction from 15 times to 10 times means you have to reach a 33% higher share price, which is a ton considering my for the retail investor highly favored calculation is already at 1250$.  
  
5: Since this is a repeat and not a new thing, strategies were most likely adjusted. There is a high chance that shorting is followed by buying, meaning this can easily turn into a win-win for them. They can sell high after a certain subreddit hypes it up like crazy, and then sell at a small lose when it comes back down again. Just as a reminder, the last time it went down to it's 30s.  
  
So yep, good luck everyone who is involved.",,

Price per earnings. You divide companys valuation with it's earnings(or alternately you divide share price with earning per share, that's the same result)

What you get is how much the market is willing to pay for the company's current earnings. 
For example company like Tesla has very high P/E. Market expects the earnings to increase in the future to justify high price or the stock is just overvalued.
If a company has very low P/E, you get high current earnings for a cheap price. The market clearly expects the earnings to dwindle. The stock is a good deal IF the market is wrong.

P/E can also be used to compare market with the past. If the average P/E of sp500 is much higher than usually you can say that the market is willing to pay more for smaller earnings. This could indicate a bubble or strange market conditions.",,

Late 70s-early 80s: real world inflation reaches beyond 14%
      Real world: Iran has a revolution and their oil production falls off the map
   Markets: crude oil prices double
      Real world correlation: long lines at the gas pump 
   Tell: Oil is a leading indicator for inflation 

This is not the 70s/80s Pull up a historic chart of treasures yields, and you will see the 70s-80s at the top left right now  it is down at the bottom right, excluding last year we are at an all time low. The rate of inflation increasing could be considered drastic this year, but actual inflation is not. In fact it would be way more concerning if inflation didn’t pick up, because it would mean the real world economy isn’t advancing.

I can point out real world deflation to you in more readily in your lifetime much easier than inflation: How much tile do you spend online? How much does it cost you? What are your expectations when paying for things such as entertainment?  All these things are a net deflationary force. Not only does it make things cheaper due to greater efficiency,  it also creates and delivers on the expectation of services and even things like entertainment for cheap/free. In other words the ubiquitous use of tech is a net deflationary force and it is something you can readily see all around you. 

So it’s all relative we can see signs of inflation in many areas now: try ordering a new tv, a new car, look at gas prices—the first two are supply chain issues, to a certain degree the second one is too and, but is still inline with historic trends. I guess the point is for all the inflation we see, it pales compared to what your dad experienced. It is nowhere close. Not by miles. As far as the fed goes they are not just doing equations, looking at charts, they are watching the real world—in fact that’s their focus—getting unemployment numbers down.  

I probably didn’t answer your question, but hopefully it was helpful in some way...",,

The assets to seize are real estate and natural resources or farmland. The game is always the same. The excuses are already pre written and the winners have it structured so that they hit their goals. In 2009 huge amounts of wealth flowed in only ONE direction- to the top. 

Wealth preservation is hugely different than wealth creation.  With wealth comes the lust to preserve it through power and manipulation. The unintended consequence of the COVID pandemic will be the continued transfer of wealth to the top 2% and corporations. The value of currency will change but the possession of wealth creating assets will increase in value. There is a mega game and strategy at play here.

It looks like it will buy the two at 10 and sell 20 so it is even on the 18th and i don't have to do anything and it will sell in the money on the 18th if it is in the money?

Because we got the loan and the economy is booming partially because of cheap and easy access loans (also generally accepted to contribute to inflation) which is good for now, but will have its consequences.

We or anyone really, shouldn’t be getting loans at sub3% rates and given the snp growth and generally “cash rich-no barrier of entry” stock trading, everything is super overheated. And driving prices extremely high.

Ireland would bring its tax rate to 10% as would everyone else who is currently under. They’d still be the cheapest. While going from 2 to 10 percent is bad, going to 15 would still be worse. And the states wouldn’t go down to 10 because they’d lose a mountain of money.

You could argue that the convenience of doing business in the states would outweigh the now much smaller difference - but the states would also know that and probably raise corporate taxes - because they can. The dynamic would be restored quickly enough in my opinion, and the result would be a net transfer of wealth from multinational companies to sovereign nations who can then redistribute that money to narrow the wealth divide.",,

305,gznj10j,2021-05-27 16:29:53,t1_gznj10j,t1_gzmqcnf,StockMarket,"So I agree with you on most of your points, but it is not really “their tax revenue” like they have done much or anything to earn it - it is that way because the corporations fundamentally want to pay as little tax as is legally possible - some would argue that not doing so is actually robbing shareholder value. 

The underlying problem is the tax laws currently are outdated and rely on various forms of physical presence tests to determine residency, which is where a company pays tax. A company in Ireland, owned by US interests, that sells exclusively to the US, can in certain circumstances be taxed almost exclusively in Ireland, purely because they have lower tax rates, while the US economy and consumers in this example are the ones paying for this company’s profits. There are very good arguments to say that this is inappropriate and that profits from US customers, in this example, should be subject to US tax rules and the US should get their fair share, and this is the way the global economy is going (see OECD initiatives and BEPS).

Ultimately what will happen is if these other small countries don’t fall in line is that the major players (US, EU, etc.) will simply say if you sold to a customer in our country, you have to pay our taxes on that sale anyway, which can result in double tax and these companies would then leave those smaller “tax havens” as they would no longer serve a purpose.",,

Lloyd’s Bank (American ADR - LYG) released the following statement in their 2021 Shareholder Event call last week regarding the opportunity to pay an additional dividend in 2021 beyond the maximum allowable set by the UK government in response to the Covid crisis. 

“Regarding our dividend. Last year, following a request to all banks by the Prudential Regulation Authority, the Group suspended dividends on ordinary shares and cancelled the final dividend for 2019. These decisions were not taken lightly and I'm sure will have come as a disappointment to you, our shareholders.

However, our capital position has remained strong as a result and, following the PRA announcement in December, the Board was therefore able to recommend a total ordinary dividend of 0.57 pence per share - the maximum allowable within the PRA guidelines.

We recognise the importance of the dividend to many of our shareholders. The PRA has said that they will consider their guidance on 2021 dividends before banks announce their half-year results, so the Board expects to be in a position to discuss interim dividends when it reviews the performance of the business for the first half of the year. Our position on quarterly dividends will also be confirmed at this time.

The Board remains committed to future capital returns. In 2021, subject to regulatory guidance, the Board intends to grow the dividend from 2020, in line with the Group's progressive and sustainable ordinary dividend policy.”

https://www.proactiveinvestors.co.uk/LON:LLOY/Lloyds-Banking-Group/rns/975557

The Prudential Regulation Authority will release an update to their guidance requiring UK banks to scrap dividends throughout 2020 and 4Q 2019 sometime this summer. Currently a maximum allowable dividend of 0.47p is set for 2021. However the PRA is expected to either increase this amount or allow banks to reinstate unrestricted dividends. Although unrestricted dividends will most likely occur in 2022, the opportunity for additional dividends in 2021 and a large increase in yield beginning in 2022 could be a catalyst for LYG to cross the $3 threshold and touch $4 around the time the updated guidance and dividend plan is released. 

Additional info from Q1 2021:

Lloyd’s CET1 ratio is 16.4% before dividends and 16.2% after, well ahead of the bank’s target of around 12.5% and regulatory requirements around 11%.

Lloyd’s released approximately $460M from their impairment reserve that was created in response to the Covid crisis. $3,740M remains in the reserve. 

Lloyd’s UK banking peers (Barclays, HSBC, NatWest) are in similar positions.",nmbega,LYG - Additional Dividend Opportunity in 2021.

They use these naked short cells to drive the price down eventually leading into bankruptcy for some companies which means that they never have to buy back and return those shares which means 100% pure profit for them.

Since Visa and Mastercard started to support cryptocurrencies, it created a surge in M&A activity in the on-ramp space.

Perhaps, the most active company has been TechX Technologies Inc., a publicly traded company listed on the  Canadian Securities Exchange. TechX acquired fiat-to-crypto gateway Xport Digital for C$5 million on May 3rd.  On May 24th, the Company just announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire Mobilum, a fintech company with fiat-to-crypto payment processing technology and a digital wallet, for C$16 million.

At present, Mobilum’s daily processing volume ranges from C$100,000 to C$250,000 in transactions for cryptocurrency exchanges that include [KuCoin](https://www.kucoin.com/assets/payments?lang=en_US), the sixth largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. Supporting over 200 cryptocurrencies and 80+ fiat currencies,  Mobilum’s payment gateway services are accessible to over 8 million global users. 

Going forward, with bitcoin and crypto now turning the heads of financial institutions and banks, it’s likely that 2021 (and beyond) will bring a greater number of ‘traditional’ finance companies buying up firms within crypto. Furthermore, we are likely to see an increase in crypto firms acquiring companies outside of the sector. 

“*TechX is very excited about acquiring Mobilum’s innovative technology, which is creating a bridge between fiat and crypto space to speed up cryptocurrency mass adoption worldwide*,” said TechX CEO Peter Green. 

No long or short term debt on the books. YTD from 0.11 to current 0.82. Reached a 52-week high of 1.68, recent dip is due to crypto scare all over the entire industry. It will recover for sure and TechX will be prepared to move higher with all the new releases and acquisitions.

The way the article was written, it certainly makes it seem like the *only* reason Charter went belly up was because it was naked short-sold into oblivion, the share price plummeted, and liquidity was exhausted.

What if I told you that the [real reason](https://www.reuters.com/article/charter/update-5-debt-load-pushes-charter-into-bankruptcy-idUSN2754416820090327) Charter Communications went bankrupt in 2009 was because it spent billions through the 1990s ""to compete with satellite television and, more recently, with phone companies offering extensive video, Internet, and other broadband features,"" buying up cable companies, upgrading systems, and generally spent millions upon millions more than it was earning?

A stop loss raid is when a whale or a group of whales (someone who holds a massive amount of shares, giving them some control of a noticeable % of the total shares aka float) dumps their shares all at once. 

That ""floods"" the market with shares, faster than ppl are even buying them, this creates excess selling pressure (selling pressure= price drop)

The goal is to push the price low enough to trigger other people's stop losses (a stop loss is an automatic order you can set, it will automatically sell your shares at a price that you select). So the whales sell their shares, flooding the market, the price drops so low it starts hitting other people's stop losses which further amplifies selling pressure, the unknowing ppl freak out and dump their shares....

Then the whales come back and buy all their shares back at a much cheaper price, and theyve washed out tons of small fish...

Thats a stop loss raid, and that is manipulating the stock price. Naked shorting has a similar goal, different method, but im not talking about that.

What im saying is, price manipulation isnt just gamestop. When you hear these ""conspiracy theories"" you think gamestop, right? Because gamestop is the 1 time that these dirty tricks EVER got so much attention. This stuff isnt new, retail investors have just been working around it for a long time. You see the wave that big money makes, ride it, get out.

413,gzntszh,2021-05-27 17:45:37,t1_gzntszh,t1_gznqzxv,StockMarket,"Absolutely, discussion is great. 

I mean there are a lot of factors pointing towards a crash or large ""correction"" no? Reverse repo rates, negative sp500 return inflation adjusted, bond rates, inflation rates, etc. A lot of those happened everytime there has been a crash no?

Additonally, as for the 10m floor. Technically they aren't wrong if the short interest theorized is correct. If the hedge funds have truly naked shorts sold hundreds and hundreds of the percent of floating shares than the price could and I emphasize could be limitless. If the price of gme and AMC continue to increase at this rate while other securities start to lower in price then this leads to a better chance of a margin call due to lack of collateral. 

Hypothetically speaking, let's say June 9th comes for the gme annual shareholder event and Ryan Cohen decides to announce the amount of votes and let's say there should be 30 million but he announces that there were 150 million then obviously a short squeeze is imminent. And that situation the float has been shorted five times over. At that point anyone who has been on the fence about buying the stock would immediately jump in because the squeeze would have to happen. Volkswagen squeezed five to six times on a 12% short interest so there would be no reason not to buy in if that short interest on GameStop is correct based on the research. If, and I mean if, that happens then the price would be a you name it type of situation. The shorts would have to cover every naked short they have created, that is extreme buying pressure and if over 30 million shares refuse to sell then the buying pressure never ends because they have to cover and because more than the float existing refuses to sell they never fully cover. That's just supply and demand. 

Is the short interest that high? No clue only Time Will tell. If it is that hot will the price really skyrocket to thousands hundreds of thousands or millions? No idea it'll only go as high as the mass amount of votes decided will and continue to hold. Personally, I do intend to sell on the way down. Whether that is the way down from 5,000 10,000 50,000 100,000 10 million who knows but I won't sell early and cut myself short I would rather sell on the way down and whatever games I achieve that will be that.

The shorts would have to cover every naked short they have created, that is extreme buying pressure and if over 30 million shares refuse to sell then the buying pressure never ends because they have to cover and because more than the float existing refuses to sell they never fully cover.

Let's say you're right. What makes you think the hedge funds have to buy all the shares? Melvin Capital has $12.5 billion in assets under management (AUM). Citadel has $25 billion. Assume for simplicity that these 2 firms have to cover 30 M shares - if the price goes above $1,250, they *literally don't have enough assets under management* to afford it.

So what happens? They just go tits up. All those people that lent their shares to these bankrupt hedge funds? Oops, sorry, your lent share is simply GONE, just like how I'll never get back that $15 I lent my grandpa a year before he died. GME price collapses, and it's over.

2021-04-27 00:51 ET - News Release

Mr. Graydon Kowal reports

GUARDIAN ANNOUNCES MOUNT CAMERON, YUKON WORK PROGRAM

Guardian Exploration Inc. has contracted Aurora Geosciences, based in Whitehorse, Yukon territory, to perform a helicopter-supported field program at its 100-per-cent-owned Mount Cameron property, located in the Mayo mining district, Yukon territory, Canada.

Mineralization at Mount Cameron consists of structurally controlled polymetallic veining and manto-style carbonate replacement mineralization (CRDs) enriched in silver-lead-zinc (Ag-Pb-Zn). Mount Cameron is similar to other nearby polymetallic Ag-Pb-Zn deposits within the Keno Hill silver district.

Historic drilling previously performed at Mount Cameron in 1974 returned values of up to 6.1 metres of 287.3 grams per tonne silver, 26.5 per cent zinc and 5.78 per cent lead.",nmfetx,Does anybody know anything about Guardian Exploration (trading symbol: GX)?

574,,2021-05-27 20:27:00,t3_nmgrju,,StockMarket,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, May 27, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed today, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) rising while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) fell modestly as market participants looked toward the new weekly jobless report. Market participants continue to closely monitor incoming inflation data, though it seems fears that the Federal Reserve will be forced to tighten monetary policy have tempered in recent weeks, with the SPY roughly 3 points away from its record level. 

This week, the indexes have largely consolidated, an encouraging sign following the volatility experienced in the first weeks of May. Market participants continue to look towards incoming economic data to further judge whether inflation will lead to a sustained jump in prices, causing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, or be a transitory side-effect as the US economy roars back following the coronavirus-induced recession. Personally, I am in the latter camp and am not concerned about sustained inflation. 

Todd Jablonski, chief investment officer at Principal Global Asset Allocation said, “Inflation has gone from being on no one’s radar screen maybe five years as a lead concern, to now being at the absolute forefront as you see the economy rebound off of COVID lows. There has been a tremendous acceleration in earnings, coupled with massive monetary and fiscal stimulus.”

members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), reiterated their stance that they were not yet concerned that new inflation data would force the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be “mostly temporary” and that the Fed was “not quite there yet” when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be “overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.” 

Richard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, also said “there will come a time in upcoming meetings” when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that “it is going to depend on the flow of data”. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.

This reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldn’t worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.”

The Department of Labor’s Weekly Unemployment Report showed jobless claims fell for the fourth straight week to yet another pandemic-era low, an encouraging sign that the labor market is improving following the extremely disappointing April Jobs report, which showed 266,000 new jobs added in the month, far below estimated of more than 1 million and a sharp deceleration in job growth compared to March. 

* **Initial jobless claims, week ended May 22:** 406,000 vs. 425,000 expected and 444,000 the week prior
* **Continuing claims, week ended May 15:** 3.642 million vs. 3.680 million expected and a revised 3.738 the week prior

**Highlights** 

* Boeing (BA) agreed to pay at least $17 million to settle enforcement cases with the Federal Aviation Administration over production issues with its 737 jets. Stock reacted positively to the news. 
* Durable goods orders, or orders for manufactured goods intended to last at least three years, unexpectedly declined in April, ending an 11-month streak of increases, the Commerce Department said Thursday, an encouraging sign. 
* “Meme stocks” are on the move again, with AMC gapping up 40% on the day. Gamestop (GME) and AMC have both been on monster runs this week.
* Paytm, India’s largest digital payment platform, is reportedly aiming to go public later this year with a valuation of $25-$30 billion.
* Shares of Ford (F) have been on fire since the company announced it was making a big investment to manufacture EVs and recently unveiled the all-electric Ford F-150 pickup, one of the company’s most popular models. \\
* Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) are all involved in a bidding process to provide cloud services to Boeing, according to multiple reports. 
* Disney’s (DIS) California-based parks will welcome non-California natives starting June 15.
* **\*\*Please note that current stock price was written in the morning and does not reflect intraday changes\*\***
* Applied Materials (AMAT) with three target raises. Stock currently around $137
   * JP Morgan from $146 to $160

Then the stock goes from $30 to $20 and I buy one of those, that leaves me with one stock and $10 profit. Was this a wise choice? Because I have profit now, but my average stock cost is now $20 per stock, but if I didn't sell, my average cost would be $10 still.

 Is average cost important?
 Because it seems that this strategy increases the average cost of my stocks every time I sell and buy, and it also gives me less profit every time too.

I believe there are a ton of hedge funds that are creating the buying pressure as well. Hedge funds are master manipulators of price and know how to take advantage of market inefficiencies. I believe they create posts on reddits like WSB too. They know how to pull the rug out on both sides. 

When Gamestop Squeeze occurred they got caught with over 100% of the float shorted… here with AMC, there is only about 20% to 30% of the float short. Also, with GME, wallstreet and hedgefunds didn’t see it coming and even if they caught wind of it they scoffed at it and did not believe it would amount to anything at all. 

This time around though – they know that WSB has the ammo and enough retail investors on board to create some real havoc for hedge funds. I guarantee you multiple people at hedge funds have eyes on the reddit boards at all times. I believe some of them create posts on reddits like this one too. Which is fine if they are on the side of the retail investor and are making trades in alignment with retail traders. However, we all know they are masters of manipulation and can easily pull the rug out when least expected. Your thoughts?

Again, I can't proof it, I can't know it for certain, but if I had to bet my money I'd say those with those call options that show off hundred of thousands, if not millions that they made are the ones winning hard while those that lose out deeply are those that get drawn in by that mindset.",,

The more important question is: would you rather have 1 stock or 1 stock and $10. By selling higher and buying lower, you are left with more than you had before. 

In this case the average cost of the first purchase - the $10 - is much more important because that's how much of your own money you put in. If it drops below your new average of $20, you can still make a profit on your original investment. In fact, it would be impossible to lose money on your original investment because you have $10 in the wallet at the end.",,

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote...

and balking at even a penny of additional liquidity. How the Fed will continue to monetize debt then, when the repo system is now out of collateral, is anyone's guess.

By mid-July, we’ll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase higher yields in the FX swap market amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative

Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks.

Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms.",nmhf0h,Rrp explosion and results

If you buy and sell, that is simply buying and selling, it doesn't matter if you buy later at a lower price, you already made a profit. Average is when you keep your shares and buy more at a lower price. You buy a share at $10, hoping it would be higher to take a profit, but it go down to $5, you are losing $5 and have to wait for it to pass the $10 to get a profit. Now, you buy one more at $5 and you have 2 shares and you averaged them to $7.50, so, if your stock pass the $7.50 mark you will get a profit. One share at $10 + one share at $5 = $15 divided 2 = $7.50. This is calling ""average"". I do it many times in order to lower the price of my shares if them go down a lot. Good luck!",,

Also, there are a lot of additional variables that HFs and financial institutions have never dealt with. Its the mania, people communicating and grouping up at break neck speeds, people digging deep into the situation why this or that is happening, how the short interest can exceed the entire float of the stock, why there were so many brokers who blocked meme stock buying back in January.

This is a completely new paradigm that not even HF experts can deal with 100%. If you can find a person who can understand all of stock market dynamics that are happening behind the scenes **AND** who understand how regular joe is thinking in these unprecedented times, with all the lockdowns and struggles at regular jobs - you will very likely become a millionaire.

IMO such one person does not exist, these are two completely different worlds. And the only thing HFs can do is to presumably find someone who ""understands"" reddit and people, and take his opinion as gospel. Which as complete gamble at this point.",,

The market continues in its uptrend for now. Even though just beginning its new move, indicating that this is the right time to buy stocks, technical wise, keep in mind that the $QQQ gained a distribution day today as shown in the chart below (closing below the previous day's close on higher volume more than 0.2%). On the bright side, a distribution day will become less significant tomorrow, followed by two more on Monday and Tuesday. 

That is not to say that the current market doesn't have too many distribution days. Most of the distribution days currently on our tracked ETFs are just less significant.

So with that said, a word of caution. Even though we are beginning a new uptrend, until those less significant distribution days fall off the map, stay on your toes and keep those stop-losses close and active.

A few years ago it was doable for $600-$700k..... nothing really under $1m now unless you settle for flood zoned land. Its really put it out of our reach for the foreseeable future. 

This latest sharp price increase I have heard is being driven by people from places like Melbourne (where covid hit the hardest in the country) selling up down there and moving up. 
House prices have always been high down there so they are cashed up when they move up and its a big part of why we are getting so many unconditional cash offers at the moment.  

Now we have supply issues as well for new builds/construction so thats going to put more upwards pressure on the existing stock of houses.",,

I had heard the US was looking at doing a national infrastructure spend as well to transition away from just shovelling $ into corporation's to life support them, then the last bit of news I heard was they kicked up a stink and said if corporation's could continue to get free money then no one else should either. (Maybe I'm taking a littler liberty with the facts here lolz) 

But if we look back, whenever nations invest in giant national infrastructure spends it creates real velocity of money in the economy and EVERYONE gets a piece of the pie (from memory the stats are somewhere around for every $1 of government subsidy = $30 of velocity in the economy).

 Seems I read news all the time about the US's crumbling national highway system that needs a massive overhaul.... Probably not the worst way to spend the way out of economic stagnation.",,

Will the government lower the cost of buying bonds to keep the interest rates lower and that has been keeping the economy somewhat afloat during the Economy. 

The less money being circulated would then mean the lower cost of bond prices and raise their yields, increasing the cost of borrowing for home buyers and corporations alike. Higher yields also erode the current value of future cash flows.

I know this is self-promotion but I believe my website will help people do stock research and invest better. If the admin thinks this post is not appropriate please delete it or let me know, I will delete it immediately. I don't mean to spam the community.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Currently some stocks' valuation seems to be totally ridiculous and based solely on memes+hype, I still believe that fundamental analysis still has a solid place in the rest of the market. Therefore I would like to introduce you to my website [ValueInvesting.io - Automate your Fundamental Analysis modeling](https://valueinvesting.io/)!

I fine-tune and pre-build financial models for most of the public-traded companies in the world. There is also a ton of other information like financial statements, historical price, analyst estimates, etc... for you to research the companies. Don't like the assumptions I choose for a model? No problem, use my valuation template to retrieve data and customize any model with a click of a button. I also build a screener and a watchlist for you to monitor the market and look for the best investment opportunities.

The subscription is $19.99/month for 1 region (or $14.99/month for annual subscriptions). Right now I offer **FREE access to all S&P 500 companies without any subscription required.** I would love to hear from you if you have any feedback/feature requests for the website.

So, give it a try...I promise you it's gonna be awesome! Thank you all, let me know if you have any questions.",nmln3i,I build a website to automate your fundamental analysis and stock research. Hope you guys can check it out!

Shares of AMC Entertainment ([AMC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMC?p=AMC)) surged over 45% in afternoon trading Thursday, pushing the market capitalization of the country's largest theater chain past $12 billion amid a boost from retail investors.

At market close, AMC was still up over 35% with a market value of just $11.94 billion.

AMC, [which narrowly avoided bankruptcy](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amc-movie-theater-avoid-bankruptcy/) earlier this year, belongs to a class of so-called meme stocks including GameStop ([GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/)) and Bed Bath and Beyond ([BBBY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BBBY/)). Retail investors active on the [subreddit WallStreetBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) have crowded into stocks of these underdog companies in an effort to force short sellers to buy them to cover their positions. This squeeze on short sellers drives the stock prices even higher.

Brick-and-mortar video game retailer GameStop, the most notable meme stock, soared over 15% on Wednesday and added another 5% on Thursday.

Retail traders on WallStreetBets talked up AMC on Thursday, with one calling the theater a ""rocket ship,"" another urging fellow Redditors ""don't sell!"" and still another asking if it ""can go to the moon?""

GME AMC and a slew of others all have charts aligning.

They are on the losing side of a short position now.  The  consequence of which (they knew the risk when they started this) is infinite losses.

910,,2021-05-28 03:16:05,t3_nmohy9,,StockMarket,"This started as a comment reply but I thought maybe people would like reading it. I've been researching Palantir since literally late November 2020 and I have nearly my entire portfolio in LEAPS expiring January 2023. So I have continually done more research on them this is just the basics to clear up confusion and help people who don't understand it because it's hard to hear all the hype and stuff. Also AMC to the moon tomorrow for my FDs I bought!! Don't judge me it's just fun to be in on the action on weeks like this.


So you should think of palantir as basically three companies and they actually are very far from unprofitable. 

They developed the really massive government software (gotham) specifically as a result of an interaction that happened to Peter Thiel while he was at paypal. They were losing millions to foreign scammers at paypal and the solution ended up being a high quality algorithm that flagged the most likely scam transactions and then allowed analysts to efficiently double check and verify the real scam transactions.

 It essentially was using what computers are efficient at (sorting through massive amounts of data) and then combining that with what humans are good at (looking at the more complex nuances that at least at that point computer algorithms were incapable of doing) and augmenting the humans ability to make complex decisions by rapidly sorting through the incoming data and bringing everything good to their attention.

They fixed paypals using this method and literally made the company profitable overnight because of fixing how much they were losing in the scam transactions. The FBI contacted PayPal and Thiel about using that initial software. That was literally his inspiration for what would become Palantir. He goes over it in huge detail in his book zero to one. If you make an audible account you can read it for free and find the chapter I'm talking about.

Then for 15 years they perfected the government software into the absolute nearly monopoly it is now in government intelligence augmentation software. The whole time though they reinvested almost everything for the last 10 years into building the commercial software (Foundry). That side of the business has only been live for a VERY short time and initially they literally didn't spend a single dollar on marketing their first commercial clients sought THEM out because of their insane reputation with the government. Foundry helps with supply chains and all kinds of other important data  insights. But if you want a recent example the NIH and the NHS both used Foundry to figure out how to best distribute the vaccine and vaccine distribution in the US and Britain has far outpaced expectations. You think commercial companies aren't going to be interested in using the software that was literally proven on a level like that?

 They're only just now adding huge amounts of people to their sales teams literally in the last six months which if you read Peter thiels book is insane for the stock because they have this crazy long term plan and he literally talks about how when they get to a certain point and start adding sales as a full sector of the company it means that is the company the company plans to BEGIN scaling. Meaning they're this big and they literally only just started on the scaling part. Which they've also said in tons of interviews if you're a die hard Palantirian like me. 



They actually also have the third side of the  business which is their actual like full AI for weaponization and war and defense for the government. Gotham is like helping analysts and commanders lead and even helping police or agents figure out what's going on. This other software is different. It's called Apollo and its only at the beginning too. It's like pure AI machine learning AI handles everything stuff. Go find a video called pentagon head of NSC briefs public on AI I think it's on the PBS channel on YouTube or some shit. Or you can listen to Joe Biden talk about how we're going to double our percentage of gdp spending on AI. The amount of government money that's going to go into AI as a weapon to compete with China DWARFS peoples expectations of how much large the market for the kind of software palantir makes is. 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201001005334/en/U.S.-Army-Research-Lab-Selects-Palantir-Technologies-Inc.-for-91M-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-Development

This is literally the backbone of everything AI that the government is about to invest in. Sure they're going to experiment with other research but if you do research you'll also find Palantir is the ONLY company that does anything remotely like this software that has anywhere near the kind of clearances like what is required for these contracts. They are currently a clearance level 5 and about to be the highest 6. The closest competitors are almost all a 3 or lower I'm not even sure if there's more than a single 4 and that stuff is crazy hard to get. 

But like again I'm an obsessive. I realize why people get so excited about the commercial side scaling and how it's very possible and can make them huge and it will. But I'm actually pretty sure the reason people like Cathy Wood has such a huge boner for them is that she realizes how MASSIVELY. And I mean MASSIVELY underestimated the amount of government revenue they will get from all this AI investing the United States and NATO are about to do. It's literally the next Manhattan project and they're absolutely going to be one of the biggest players developing it if not the biggest. I think it's funny because most people are pretty disinterested in the government stuff for Palantir but i really think the weaponized AI apollo stuff may be as big as anything could ever be. 




Also people got the insider selling stuff very very wrong. Tom Nash (love him or hate him I don't care) has a few really good recent videos where he explains it in basically full detail what was happening. The selling panicked a lot of retail investors during a time when the buying for growth markets had really slowed because of rate hike due to inflation scares and a ton of retail holders got scared and caused more selling and more people got scared because of that and sold and it really just was mass psychology in effect and a LOT of FUD and confusion. 

Basically a few executives karp in particular got billions of dollars worth of options that vest but literally expire so you have to exercise them which means you buy shares of the company at a strike price. Well because it's the company granting shares the strike price is literally 10 cents or something and these automatically have to vest at quarterly increments. So everytime karp was exercising he's actually buying shares. Like over 150 million in total maybe a lot more million SHARES not dollars. shares. And even those when he exercising he's buying shares technically from the company it ALL counts as profit on taxes and ITS NOT LONG TERM CAP GAINS ELIGIBLE. So over the last year plus this year he's essentially getting shares but the literal dollar value of those shares to the government counts as pure profit. So his total income which he's getting taxed at 40% of is in the BILLIONS yes billions. Because that's a lot to handle people that work for them actually automatically schedule sells of shares to cover the taxes so that there's no issue it's not even like him saying sell today and they do this.... TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INSIDER SELLING TO THE SEC. That's why it's automatically happening so no one can ever claim he's timing it. 

So listen cause here's where it gets important. The exercising of the shares counts as almost pure profits but remember he's receiving SHARES not dollars he doesn't actually get billions of dollars. So has to then sell SOME of the shares so he can pays taxes on that. Then when he sells the shares to pay the taxes for exercising he actually owes even more money if they went up from when he exercised. So everytime he's selling low its actually good for him because it's less ADDITIONAL PROFIT that he would owe taxes on.

 If he wasn't selling its because he thought it would go down even further and then he would actually owe less taxes overall. So if he thought it was going to tank he'd wait and actually get a nice fat discount on his taxes. 

I know this seems really crazy but I promise that's how it works you can look it up in detail but yeah shocking that mainstream media and redditors/youtubers who barely do research and have no real understanding of how these billion dollar compensations work would get it wrong. Unbelievable I know. If he had actually sold the massive overall percentage of his shares that some people claim he did the company would be at like $3-6 dollars not low 20s.

Pull up a chair. I'm here to tell you about some smart people shit.

Whenever you see a company with $325 million revenue but a market cap of only $300 million you want to take a close look especially when you know the revenue is going to continue in the future.

Here's the deal:

Have you gotten your vaccine yet? Chances are you were stuck with an RVP Retractable Technologies needle.  
If the needle was retractable, that's the one. Retractable Technologies.  
That's the ticket.

RVP just had earnings last week, and it blew earnings out of the water.  
Why? Because half the country is half-vaccinated, dummies. That's a shit-ton of needles they went through last quarter.  
And now the other half of the vaccinations have to get stuck into people. And then the other half of the country needs to get their vaccines too.

But wait, there's more.  
""Dumbshits don't want to get vaccinated, man. COVID Vaxxes in the United States are over, moron!""  
BOMP! That's where you're wrong, knuckledraggers!  
First off, people are getting vaccinated at baseball games and shit now. There are still people out there who need their shot - haven't had the time, don't think it's a priority, whatever - who aren't opposed but it just hasn't been easy or fun. You can literally catch a foul ball, choke on a hotdog, and get vaccinated at the same time now.  
Also more importantly the United States isn't the whole world. People seem to forget that when they buy stock in Apple or Nike or whatever other boring-ass companies are stable. Those companies have high market cap because their shit is available worldwide and people want it.  
Well guess what: people in other countries haven't had the chance to call the COVID vaccine passé bullshit the same way we have here. They're still waiting for their shots. The White House has a bunch of pull-up-machine jarhead fuckin' Marine Corps motherfuckers packing boxes of RETRACTIBLE TECHNOLOGIES' NEEDLES inbetween sets of burpees and puking because they ran 5-minute miles in desert heat and then those boxes are getting shipped worldwide.

As a matter of fact, the demand is so damn high worldwide that the feds cut a $27M check to help Retractable increase *production capability* so that they can keep up with the demand for the worldwide shipment orders that are going to **keep coming in** from DOD and HHS and so that they can eventually get to the backlog of orders that they still have coming in from the private sector.

""Why the fuck do people want these needles? Any needle will do, right?""  
Are you serious? Ever heard the phrase ""whoever builds a better mousetrap..."" ???  
Here's your better mousetrap. And this company owns the patent for it.  
*There are other companies that make retractable low deadspace needles on the market, but those companies have to pay RVP to use those technologies.*  
These are those fucking ""low deadspace"" needles you hear about on the news all the time that enable you to get more doses out of a vial. These needles retract so that the nurses don't prick their hands when they're juggling between getting a bandaid on your arm, disposing of the needle, and all the other stupid little steps in the process.  
Between the low deadspace making vaccine supply last longer and the NO ACCIDENTS thing, there's talk that insurance companies are going to start demanding that hospitals use these needles if they want to do business - both the patients' insurance companies AND THE MALPRACTICE INSURANCE COMPANIES **duh**.  
When I got my vaccine I asked the nurse what she thought about the retractable needle. She told me the fact that they had them there was a sign that the admins at the vax site gave a shit about them as employees. Admins are literally ordering these to keep nurses happy so they stay on the job.

So here's the deal: Bleecker Street is a short selling firm that tried to sink this ship. There are others involved in this that are shorting the hell out of it. The shorts are about twice the float right now.  
Bleecker's short report was basically ""CoViD iS oViD dUmBsHiTs ain't nobody gonna need needles after this!"" which is fucking dumb as hell because they aren't taking into account the following:

1. The government doesn't just give money to a company to **expand production capability** if they don't intend to keep ordering **in perpetuity**
2. COVID isn't the **only** disease we need vaccines for
3. Vaccines aren't the only things we need shots for. My dentist used one on me Monday. It did not retract. He openly stated that he wished he could get his hands on those instead.
4. The government isn't the only customer ordering these needles
5. OTHER NEEDLES SUCK TOTAL BALLS IN COMPARISON  
WOULDN'T YOU RATHER YOUR KIDS STEP ON A RETRACTABLE NEEDLE IN A DARK ALLEY INSTEAD OF ONE THAT WILL PRICK THEM WITH DOPE AND HepC?!
6. Needles administer vaccines and medicines to more than just humans. Anybody in here got a dog? Ever bring 'em in for a rabies shot?

Here's the chart below.

So I bought in at $9.93 a share. Later, I saw it kept rising so I bought in a little more at around $13 and then more at $14. I haven’t bought any since and my now $220 invested is valued close to $430. 

I’m aware that there’s risk involved. There’s risk involved with buying any stocks. Some more than others. Anyways, I’ve come here today to all my fellow redditors to ask you; do I keep riding the wave or is it time to sell? I know no one is 100% sure about where it’s going, but I wanted to hear all of y’all’s opinions on this. So please, enlighten me with your opinions",nmoqlo,Let’s talk about AMC for a second…

When you see stocks making unusually high increases obviously it can mean things are just warming up and greater increase is on the way or simply because these high points have never before been reached so people see a small decline and jump ship which leads to more of a decline and soon a large one due to fear of lost profits. Well think about it this way in this new age the stock market has been reaching record highs due to the new comers gaining interest in stocks, and following “trends” so if you see something that’s got social media coverage and it starts to climb than hop on for the ride and hold on tight because these things tend to take off and reach greater heights many times past its previous peek. So you can sell now but if it reaches even greater peeks you’ll be kicking your own behind wishing you stayed on longer. But I’m not a financial advisor so I don’t kno shii",,
