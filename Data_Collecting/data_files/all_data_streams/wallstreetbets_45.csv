Definitely sell the options rather than exercise if they have any time value left.  You can always use the money to buy more shares if you want.

For example if the share price is $9.50 but you can sell your options for $0.55, that's better than exercising.  Exercising would throw away $0.05/share.  If you want to own the shares you can always use the $9 you would have used to exercise, plus 50 cents of what you go out when you sold the options to buy shares.  That way you pocket the extra $0.05/share.

The only time it really makes sense to exercise is if you can't get the full intrinsic value because of liquidity problems.  Like if the share price was $9.50 but you couldn't sell the options for $0.50 or more, then exercising makes sense.  That's pretty rare though; usually it's pretty easy to close the position at a fair price.",,

Check it out. OP has his text post removed three times, so this time he posts a screenshot of the text. 

The plan is to burn the hed&#xFEFF;ies to the ground by going long volatility. Apparently the hedg&#xFEFF;ies have been selling it to pay for their short positions, so if they all pile into VXX and UVXY then they can squeeze them too and cut off their source of funding. Then because there's a scarcity of treasuries they won't be able to cover and they'll all die... for some reason.

I would say it's a troll because it's so misguided and out there, but I don't think it is. It's the perfect troll post, though. I'm not sure you could break more rules in a single submission if you tried. Maybe if you add a SPAC and a shitpenny to the mix?",,

Did you secretly wish you were one of the degenerate gamblers from Star Wars: the Last Jedi? 

Have you ever seen the movie War Dogs staring known stock expert [Jonah Hill](https://www.businessinsider.com/jonah-hill-hospitalized-fake-cocaine-in-wolf-of-wall-street-2016-8)?

If you answered yes to any of these questions, I’ve got some juicy DD for you. No longer is profiting off of human uncertainty and violence exclusively a rich man’s game. Allow me to explain: 

Vista Outdoors ($VSTO) is an outdoor sports and recreation company that owns several recognizable brands such as Camelbak, Camp Chef, and Bushnell. But that’s not important. You’re reading this because you wanna make quick cash off of the collapse of society. Well $VSTO has got you covered.  

$VSTO owns a massive portion of the shooting sports market. In September of last year they acquired all of Remington’s ammunition factories, the last of which began full-scale production earlier this [year. ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/aaronsmith/2021/02/04/bullet-sales-are-booming-as-vista-brings-remington-factory-online/amp/)

In addition to Remington, $VSTO also owns the ammunition brands Federal Premium, CCI, Hevi-shot, Estate Cartridge, and Speer. This accounts for the majority of ammunition produced in the US. 

They also own Alliant Powder, one of the largest producers of smokeless gunpowder in the United States.

You get the idea: if someone is buying ammo, they’re doing it through $VSTO. 

Why is this important? How will this make me money? 

Well right now the US is experiencing one of the largest ammunition shortages in [history.](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/cant-find-ammo-why-great-bullet-shortage-could-last-years-185734)

This shortage is being driven my unprecedented demand for guns and ammo. A combination of fears over [Biden’s ](https://joebiden.com/gunsafety/) gun control plans, a rise in civil unrest, and plain old boredom have caused ammo sales to [skyrocket.](https://thecrimereport.org/2021/01/13/gun-sales-spike-across-the-u-s-following-capitol-riots/) 

Last year roughly 9 million Americans bought guns for the first time. In January 2021 alone, the ATF reported 4.1 million background checks for gun purchases, the largest single month since record keeping [began](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/43371461)

All of these guns are being purchased, and you can’t find ammo fucking *anywhere*. I don’t think it takes a rocket surgeon to understand that guns are useless hunks of metal without ammo to make the boomsticks go boom. 

To prove my point, you can do a little experiment right now in the comfort of your wife’s boyfriend’s home. Try calling your local gun store and ask if you can come in today and purchase 500 rounds of 9mm ammo. When they laugh in your face you’ll see what I’m talking about. 

Late last year, when demand wasn’t as high as it is now, $VSTO reported a backlog of $1 billion dollars in ammunition sales. 1 fucking [BILLION.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/vista-outdoors-ammunition-backlog-billion.amp)
 
They have nearly [doubled ](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/vsto/earnings) their estimated earnings for the past three quarters, and the trend shows no signs of slowing down. 

Their P/E ratio is still hovering at around 8.5/9.0 indicating that the stock is still criminally undervalued. 

This company is printing money as fast as they can make it, and they’ve just acquired more money making factories. You don’t need so much as a single brain wrinkle to understand what I’m saying.

# Discussion:

**What’s a good bet in the short term?**

Consumer Discretionary (XLY) and Tech (didn’t think I’d be saying that) is looking pretty nice in the short term. The follow companies in Tech (XLK) have shown some strength and gone on a bit of a run.

https://preview.redd.it/utk79n1qlo171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c33200cbf190f0898afe16c76a22a9353257f036

The following companies are showing signs they may run up in the coming months. Personally, I’d narrow my research to these companies. I’m a semiconductor nerd, so I’m happy to see signs of a turnaround in INTC, AMD, and MU.

https://preview.redd.it/sz9ubhkslo171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=43812473c30a230ed2108ef37c6954bb2e3cda64

**What’s a good bet in the long term?**

Utilities (XLU), Consumer Staples (XLP), and Healthcare (XLV) all look like good sectors for long term bets. The problem is that they are starting to underperform the SPY in the short term.

XLRE seems to be floating around with the SPY, and slightly outperforming in the short term. 

Personally, I’m going to focus on short term investments within strong short term sectors until I see the trajectory for these long term plays start to turn around in the short term.

**This is a Casino Sir - My Bets/Positions:**

**XLK -– Long Call - 7/16 @ 0.7 delta**

**XLY -– Long Call - 7/16 @ 0.7 delta**

Wanted to enter a PAYC PCS but the B/A was too wide.

**MU –- PCS – 7/16 @ 0.7 delta for credit > 1/3 strike width**

**DESCRIPTION**

Charge Point is an electric infrastructure company that designs, develops & manufactures hardware & software solutions for electric vehicles at large. It offers a portfolio of hardware, software, & services for corporate, public, & residential customers. Company was founded in 2007 and operates in 14 countries.

**History**

In June 2017, $CHPT took over 9,800 electric vehicle charging spots from GE. Prior to that point, $CHPT managed 34,900 charging stations across Mexico, Australia, Canada, and the United States.

The current CEO and president as of 2018 is Pasquale Romano. On November 28, 2018, $CHPT raised $240 million. At the time, $CHPT maintained 57,000 charging spots. In 2019, VW's [Electrify America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrify_America) and $CHPT agreed to provide common access to their US customers. Company reached 100,000 chargers in September 2019, while adding more than 2,000 charging locations per month. Currently $CHPT offers 132k charging station network. Which accounts for 72% market share of total level 2 charging in North America. New entity was formed from Legacy Charge Point combined with Switchback late Feb 2021;

**What is the business model of CHPT?**

Charge Point sells hardware & software (equipment & network subscriptions) to property owners. The company doesn't own the majority of stations. It doesn't monetize energy. It only monetizes the driver, thus capital light business model.

**BUSINESS OVERVIEW**

* Shares Float 299mln
* Institutional ownership \~13%
* 2 Year CAGR Revenue Growth 65.65%; 5 Year 60%;

📷

$CHPT enjoys the [largest share](https://investors.chargepoint.com/why-invest/default.aspx) of Level 2 chargers in the US. Data from [AFDC](https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html#/analyze?fuel=ELEC) shows that $CHPT wields the largest market share at 42.8K L2 chargers out of 92.8K total of which 11.5K are ""non-networked"", carving \~53% market share of ""networked"" chargers. No 2 competitor is Tesla with 16.8K, No3 largest, is SemaCharge Network at 5.2K, followed by Blink with 3.1k which is 4th. In terms of L3 'Superchargers', where Tesla leads the way with 10.7k of 19.6k units. $CHPT is competitive with 1.5k with only Electrify America coming in higher at 2.5k. Superchargers account for \~22% of the market pie, L2 \~75% and L1, \~3% of market share. People keep reiterating that L3 is the future and no one should bother with L1 & L2. Well, that's wrong. L3 is obviously the option for the highways, commercial and service transportation. Even larger segment though is found at: parking lots, restaurants, cinemas, sports arenas, malls, corporate offices and other mass conglomerations. This is where L2 comes to play much cheaper than L3 to install, but with longer charging times - perfect fit.

**Products**

Comprehensive Hardware Portfolio Delivers - Solutions for every use case, all vehicle types and brands - High efficiency in power and footprint - Modular, scalable, secure architecture designed for serviceability- Unparalleled quality; advanced testing (vehicle, functional, climate, environment) for long-term reliability - Options for site hosts to use custom branding

**Software Enables** \- Control of who can use stations and when - All vehicles to get charged on time - Multiple vehicles to share power - Drivers to get in line when ports are occupied- Roaming integrations with other charging networks

**Challengers**

* $VLTA; Claims to go beyond just charging EVs, their chargers are used for ads and their charger placement is based on data analytics in collaboration with $PLTR. When company compares itself to the competition, they do it all - they own the gear, they sell the electricity, they provide software and networks, they do fancy data things, they do advertising. The things they don't do, are manufacture and sell the chargers. They cherry-pick a bunch of stats to show that their chargers have better ""engagement"" but given they only have 1.7k Level 2s & 6 L3. It's like chargers-as-billboards, selected to prime locations. *Anyone can replicate it, if it provides substantial revenue boost, competitors will emulate it*.
* SemmaConnect: Company boasts 3rd largest market share of L2 chargers. SemmaConnect also manufactures chargers and sell software. SemaConnect chargers are OCPP compliant. Sema appears not to have a L3 offering, nor do they appear to offer sales to individuals (single-family residential).
* $EVGO; EVgo claims to have made the first 150kW and 350kW L3 chargers, and base their business largely on L3 chargers. AFDC data says they only have 403 L2s but 1.4k L3 which garners 4th market share. Company also offers drivers a membership for reduced charging rates (\~0.04/min assuming you spend 7.99/month) and they have integrated Tesla connectors on their newer L3. EVgo also has a nationwide infrastructure roll-out deal with GM and are entirely powered by renewables. What differentiates the company is the L3 focus.
* $BLNK: Overhyped POP stock. Blink sells L2 and L3 chargers to business and individuals. Claims to operate on an owner/operator model. From EC:*""The Company made continued progress with its owner/operator strategy; the number of commercial Blink-owned charging stations contracted or deployed during the quarter grew by 51% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period.""*
* $VWAGY Subsidiary:(Electrify America): L3 focused company, it enjoys 2.5k L3 chargers. EM also sells a L2 for the home. EM offers an app, membership for drivers with a monthly fee that gets you a good discount on their charging costs. The membership and cost to charge suggests that they own their chargers. EM also have an electric vehicle subscription service and have some relationships with Jeep and Hyundai. All its reports seem to be released to the California Air Resources Board. Company doesn't appear to build their own chargers, instead relying on procurement, using third-party hardware and software.

**Near Term Catalysts**

In relation to upcoming US government infrastructure bill: ""AlixPartners estimates $300 billion will be needed to build out a global charging network to accommodate the expected growth of EVs by 2030, including $50 billion in the U.S. alone.""

It's not too late to make bets on upcoming infrastructure bill. Yes you can dabble into construction firms and commodity plays, but you don't know which companies will win lucrative contracts and sizes of those contracts. Well the biggest companies you might say? It's not that clear cut. What is clear cut, is that the focal point of this infrastructure bill is transition to renewable energy and overhaul of pivotal infrastructure. $CHPT has the most experienced (14yrs) company with largest manufacturing capacity, technical know how and ability to take on large scale projects like, building hundreds of thousands of charging stations across all states (500k by 2030). Oh yeah one more thing, former $CHPT board member is in current administration.

That's only US. $CHPT operates infrastructure in the hub of world's renewable energy aka Europe. (Also, Canada, Australia, UK, Mexico among other places) You find yourself at the erection of the infrastructure that you and your kids will be utilizing down the road. Just like, railways, roads, telcoms and internet.

**Long Term Catalysts**

\- Fossil fuel bans - Transit electrification dates - Incentive programs - All major auto OEM brands committed to electric + Further EV cost reductions with advances in battery technology.

$CHPT Growth Directly Proportional to EV Penetration, $CHPT Estimated $1B Revenue at 3% EV Penetration.

**Miscellaneous**

$CHPT Apple Store rating: 4.6.

$CHPT also has the #1 bestselling home charging station on Amazon with hundreds of 5 star reviews.

$CHPT offers access to hundreds of thousands of places to charge with one account via proprietary app.

In collaborations with Daimler, Toyota, BMW, Siemens etc.

No1 choice for Fortune 500 companies. Customers include: Google, Target, IKEA, NASA, GM, Pepsico, Disney, McDonalds, FedEx, Stanford etc.

Shareholders lock up period ends on September 1st.

**MOAT**

* First Mover Advantage (With 14 years of experience in a nascent industry, this is where big contracts will go)
* Asset light business model ( Selective ownership of charge stations, outsources maintenance & responsibilities to the owner)
* Economies of Scale ( $CHPT has largest manufacturing capacity)
* Network Effect ( \~75% of charging network market share & operations in 14 countries)

**CONCLUSION**

All in all $CHPT stock is a pure EV exposure, with light CapEx business model. Company is the ecosystem player with defensible MOATs, recurring revenue streams and visibility. $CHPT finds itself in eco friendly category and attracts premium valuation due to penetrance in multiple domains: EV Ecosystem (Hardware), Software Powered Solutions and Energy Technology.  Yes most of its network is L2 chargers, but it's where most of the money is to be made. As users go to restaurants, malls, sports events/concerts, office, cinema, universities or just a Parking Lot! There will be L2 charger not L3 due to: Charger Cost Basis/Time Parked. Pretty straightforward formula.

**Why am I interested in $CHPT?**

Because it's an entrenched leader with tremendous experience in a nascent industry.

Because it's a clever business model based on light assets which will subsequently offer high margins 5 years from now. And is literally replacement of GAS stations no matter what happens! And is a home ""GAS station"".

Because EVs are the future and I am catching the momentum and inevitable supremacy and prevalence of charging stations.

A small market cap in the market that will explode no matter what.

This is really well rounded company with superb fundamentals & \~13% institutional ownership, what's going to happen to the stock when institutions commence adoption of it? Let me use a technical term you''ll understand, the valuation will go - bananas.

BB:
60 $30c 01/2022 at $0.27
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀


Already powering many of the telematics of current cars, BB is poised to benefit from their established relationships with big automakers. Getting certified with an automaker is not easy, so it is a barrier to entry for other companies wanting in on the action. Security and reliability are top of mind for these companies. You don’t want your car to get hacked easily, so what better than a cybersecurity company that happens to also do EV software, and already has experience with ICE cars. I did a long DD here 4 months ago and still stand by it: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxknrl/bb_dd_9_reasons_why_bb_is_from_former_bb_employee/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf


SONY:
100 shares at $101
🚀🚀🚀


I wouldn’t call this the Japanese equivalent for BB, as they aren’t a cybersecurity company. But Sony has a thriving consumer and B2B business that benefits greatly from consumer demand: the fact that they are literally selling every single PS5 they make is amazing and image sensors going out on many cell phones, including Apple using both image and lidar sensors from Sony. Great solid volume of sales to stabilize the company after some stagnant years.

On PS5, it’s actually a good thing that there’s a chip shortage. As Sony loses money on the hardware (and earn on game royalties and licenses), they are buying time to refine their manufacturing to lower costs, and lose less money on hardware sales. And because demand is so hot for the PS5, they are on track to build a bigger platform than even PS4 to charge 20-30% on every game they sell. That’s some fat margin.

Now, you’re probably wondering…wtf, I’m here to read about EVs, why you telling me about PS5s? Yeah, you’re right but a conglomerate like Sony is multifaceted. While they build up their EV software platform, they have cash cows in imagery and video games. And if Apple is really building an EV, I would bet (am literally betting) that they would rely on currently trusted partners like Sony for their imaging needs. You sit inside an Apple car and camera recognizes who you are and where you’re sitting? Well that’s probably a Sony camera…or 20 of them. There will be so many cameras inside and outside of any Apple car. I mean…my iPhone 12 has 4 cameras, and it’s a tiny slab of glass and my family can’t sit inside and drive down the road with others in the environment.

And when Japanese automakers get into EVs, they’ll look into a Japanese partnership. Guess who’s probably in pole position?

Full disclosure, I also have 150 AAPL.



VW:
200 shares @ $33.32
🚀🚀🚀🚀

You are all excited about Ford. I am too but I’m not buying into them because I think they are overhyped. But what’s interesting about Ford’s EV play is that they are partnering with VW to do so. That means…even if Ford can’t sell that many cars, VW will probably still benefit from joint research development and cost sharing. We also know how much more climate change is viewed as reality in Europe, and that’s VW’s home territory. VW already launching EVs under Audi, Porsche in the premium sector, VW, Skoda and Seat in the value sector, and Bentley and Lamborghini will likely have their ultra premium EVs soon.

But you might wonder…what about Tesla? They are so great! Well yeah they aren’t that bad. But VW is a goddamn monster. It’s kind of cute when Tesla announces a new plant, oh this is my 4th plant! We now have Shanghai and Fremont and building out Berlin and Austin. That’s cute. VW has 136 plants around the world. The economies of scale is insane and will be able to source materials for incredibly better deals. Oh and there’s that other partner called Ford who builds millions of cars a year also jumping into to beat on suppliers to give them both better pricing. Welcome to the big leagues, EVs.

VW is likely to launching 5-10 EVs per year, the equivalent the full Tesla line up every year. And they have Electricfy America network (and Canada) and similar in Europe.

And one more thing: VW also does trucks. Like 18 wheeler trucks. They are one of the biggest manufacturers, behind brands such as Man, Scania, and Navistar. And trucks have even more of a compelling business case for EVs…Will merge this part with Volvo.


Volvo:
800 shares @ $26
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀


Going to keep this briefer because this is already a novel. Now, when I say Volvo, I don’t mean Volvo Cars. That’s bought by Geely and yes they are making EVs under Volvo and Polestar brands. But I’m taking about AB Volvo, still out of Sweden, building trucks, mining equipment, backhoes, haul trucks and cranes.

EVs are so more more compelling because of the use and mileage they get. It’s not uncommon for a one year old truck to have a million miles. And as cities around the world clamp down on urban center access (congestion or polluter fees common in Europe, and allow EVs in for discount or free), EVs increasingly make more sense. You save so much on lower op/maintenance costs, avoiding tolls and tax credits. Oil prices will be going back up so saving on fuel costs is the smart thing to do.

Another thing is, governments around the world are spending trillions on infrastructure stimulus. What do these trillions buy? Concrete, steel, Volvo construction equipment, labor. Where does the concrete, steel and other commodities (like rising gold and silver prices) come from? They get mined out of the ground with big Caterpillar, Liebherr and Volvo equipment. Yep, there’s Volvo again!

So if you believe stimulus is happening, Volvo is a good choice. If you believe inflation is real, Volvo is a good choice. If you believe EV is the future for hauling shorter distances and/or heavy loads, Volvo is a good choice.

2158,,2021-05-27 18:06:29,t3_nmdjep,,wallstreetbets,"Clearly, the company Shopify {SHOP} is in a market that is growing as it was showing before the beginning of the pandemic already -when the stock rose up to $500. I mean who doesn't believe in the internet here :-\]

During the pandemic, this SOFTWARE company helped a lot of smaller and midsize businesses as they were easily able to set up an e-commerce presence with Shopify's help. As a result, SHOP revenue increased a lot and the stock got propelled up to a crazy over 200 times forward earnings and a still to high current $$ 1240 price tag today. Yeah, that is my opinion only but Note: At the last press conference they said that operating cost will increase \[and by revenue increase will slow down\], THEY SAID IT - but nobody wants to hear it. 

You may wonder why to believe me if everybody can see that the stock price didn't fall back to a quite logic 60 times earnings \[like FANG Stocks for example\] ... meaning about 7-800 Dollars ...  

Well, SHOP was falling but then ...   
I can only assume that the three leaving executives teamed up with some other people who are interested in bumping the stock up again. Together they started an extensive press campaign, the one that we see even today: ""Shopify poised to go up"" I read today? Is it not that always when another one of these messages comes out A LOT OF stocks are suddenly traded? And that when the price goes up \[and even down\] it is often a very controlled 40bucks a day?    


IF you still want to read more, let's look up that complete marketing campaign to bring the SHOP stock up again:   
First Shopify was compared with Amazon itself - which is laughable. Even Karl Marx knew already that capitalism tends to create a monopoly. Shopify ... by helping all the little and medium companies with their software is the exact opposite of Amazon. Not to mention that the malls are full again ... meaning fewer people will buy online than during the pandemic. Which at least in the short and midterm will bring online revenues down a bit.

Then Google mentioned some Google button that makes it easier to find Shopify customers. Well yes but that doesn't help Shopify results at all. AND it makes clear that Shopify customers severely lack visibility compared with an omnipotent Amazon.   
   
Then the Shopify payment system was hyped. Buy now pay later? REALLY? The """"have's"""" have credit cards and pay with them as they even get perks/payback and points for it. So who uses the buy now pay later system? The ""DO NOT HAVE's with only a half-decent credit score of course.

Sorry but when I read about this I was only able to imagine the Shopify payment system as a """"buy now pay NEVER"""" system and I certainly had no idea how this helps the Shopify stock in the long run. Do the revenue numbers go up in the quarterly results? What about liabilities? 

Then SHOP was mentioned as the ""stock to have"" in 2021 ?? Not even worth a comment. 

For me, the only thing that is ""poised to happen"" is that the pockets of the three leaving former executives of Shopify are filled and that the buying retail investors are screwed over in about 2 months' time with a two-digit percentage loss. 

And I write all this while I actually like the Shopify story, as I like Tesla and so many things that are happening with all these wonderful tech companies ...  
But IMO the SHOP stock goes back to $800 exactly as Tesla went down from 900\[intraday\] to now 600...

Well, Good luck, give me your thoughts and I hope the bots even allow a huge and way too long posting like this.",nmdjep,My thoughts about all the stories published on SHOP Stock recently

&#x200B;

Orladeyo is the ***first Oral approved*** treatment used to prevent swelling attacks in people with ***hereditary angioedema (HAE)*****,** disease which is estimated to affect ***1 in 50,000 people***

&#x200B;

\- Orladeyo was firstly approved in the ***USA*** ***December the 3rd,*** ***2020. Q4***

\- Orladeyo received ***Japan*** NHI price listing approval ***April the 14th, 2021. Q2***

\- Orladeyo received ***Europe*** approval ***April the 30th, 2021 Q2***

\- Orladeyo received ***UK*** approval ***May the 12th, 2021 Q2***

&#x200B;

***CEO*** himself Jon Stonehouse ***confirmed*** in the [last conference call, ( 22:15 )](https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/mqqo89/bcrx_biocryst_apr_14_2021_at_845_am_edt_20th/) ***Orladeyo will annually*** be generating ***$500MM plus revenue.***

\-Serge Belanger ( ***Analyst*** ): I think in the past you've talked about ***sales potential for Orladeyo of 500 million plus***, are you still reiterating that target?

\- Stonehouse ( ***CEO*** ): ***Yeah make sure you remember the plus.***

&#x200B;

***Orladeyo*** is [ranked](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/pharmacy/20-most-expensive-prescription-drugs-in-2021.html) the ***#13 most expensive drug*** ***in the USA*** market. ***$37,308*** is approximately what patients must monthly pay to access the drug.

&#x200B;

***Before oral Orladeyo*** was approved for HAE, ***patients*** would only have treatments that required usage of ***needles***. This dramatically ***reduced the*** ***quality of their life***, making some of them quit using the treatment. That's the main ***reason*** why ***Orladeyo is a game changer***.

&#x200B;

As it's shown in[ the January 2021 Corporate Presentation](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 16), Physicians expect to Prescribe ***Orladeyo for over 40% of HAE Patients.***

&#x200B;

* **4.1.1** **Pricings/Revenue**

&#x200B;

**USA**

In the USA there currently are 10,000 patients, ***7500 diagnosed and treated,*** 1700 diagnosed but not treated, 600 treated but not diagnosed.

Physicians expect to prescribe Orladeyo for over 41% of HAE patients. Conservatively thinking, taking 7,500 patients ( the diagnosed and treated ones ) out of the total 10,000 pool in the USA, with over[ 41% of patients prescription](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) ( page 16 ) we would conservatively aim for ***3,075 patients.***

The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in the USA, is equal to ***485,000$***

&#x200B;

**Japan**

On November the 5th Biocryst undergone an agreement with ***Torii Pharmaceuticals.*** A local Japanese company that will be in charge of getting new patients to be treated with Orladeyo in Japan and commerzialing it.

Japan has around 2,500 HAE patients, and Biocryst conservatively expects to ***at*** ***least reach 500 patients.***

The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in Japan, is equal to ***$248,500***

***Approval of Orladeyo in Japan issued a $15MM milestone payment*** from Torii.

***BioCryst will receive*** tiered royalties ranging from ***20% - 40% of Japanese sales.***

&#x200B;

**Europe**

It's estimated to be around ***12,000 HAE patients in Europe.*** Following the physician prescription of over[ 41% of patients to prescribe](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 16) for Orladeyo. We get a total of ***4,920 patients*** in Europe.

Since pricings and jurisdictions work in a different way in Europe, the amount of money each patient will have to pay for Orladeyo is expected to be around or above Japan's ***$248,500/year.*** This number should soon be confirmed.

With this yearly prices and the amount of patients defined before, we get the following results.

&#x200B;

\- ***USA - 3,075p x 485K = 1,491,375,000$***

\- ***Japan - 500p x 248,5K = 124,250,000$***

\- ***EU - 4,920p x 248,5K = 1,222,620,000$***

&#x200B;

Summing it all up we get $2,751,270,000. From that number we have to subtract 123,100,000$ making it a total of ***$2,628,170,000***. The sustraction happens as a result of the undergone Royalty agreement with Torii Pharmaceuticals and Royalty Pharma.

&#x200B;

* **4.1.2 Q1 EarningsReport Beat**

&#x200B;

On May the 6th, 2021 BCRX presented Q1 Earnings Report data which managed to ***Beat Analysts estimates***. Basically what matters from this ***Q1 ER*** is that it was the ***launch of Orladeyo***, and Analysts wanted to see a decent amount of money generated by it. They were expecting Orladeyo sales to top ***$3.1MM*** ***and Orladeyo actually generated*** ***$10.94MM***, this is a ***353% sales beat***

The consequence of the ER beat was an increase of ***24.06%*** in the ***SP***

&#x200B;

It's ***important*** to mention that ***revenues generated this Q1*** only came from the ***USA.***

This ***Q2 Orladeyo*** has been ***approved in Japan/Europe/UK*** aswell, adding new sources of revenue.

***Orladeyo sales*** are expected to ***grow exponentially*** each quarter. Main reason for it is that it has been approved in the countries mentioned above. The other reason is that the amount of ***patients*** they treat will slowly ***score up*** as insurance companies allow their clients to be treated with this drug.

&#x200B;

* **4.1.3 Orladeyo value**

Having in mind the discussed numbers before, Orladeyo alone will be generating ***$2,628,170,000*** a year, using the average mid-cap Biotech company multiplier **x7**. We get a total of ***$18,397,190,000*** meaning an increase of ***$104,46*** in the stock price.

**○ 4.2 Peramivir** ™ **(Rapivab)**

Peramivir (Rapivab) is an antiviral drug for the treatment of influenza. Peramivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor, acting as a transition-state analogue inhibitor of influenza neuraminidase and thereby preventing new viruses from emerging from infected cells. It is approved for intravenous administration.

On 19 December 2014, the FDA approved Peramivir to treat influenza infection in adults. Peramivir has also been approved in Japan and South Korea and is available in Japan as Rapiacta and in South Korea as Peramiflu.

The U.S. government (department of Health and Human Services) gave BioCryst Pharmaceuticals more than $77 million to finish the Phase III clinical development of peramivir. In 2009 the department of Health and Human Services had already given about $180 million to the program.

In 2013 the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA/HHS) released new funding under the current $234.8 million contract to enable completion of a New Drug Application filing for intravenous (IV) peramivir.

&#x200B;

* **4.2.1** **Peramivir value**

With all the explanations given above and having in mind Peramivir is a government bio-defense drug the value of Rapivab can not be less than ***$500,000,000*** conservatively speaking.

**○ 4.3 Galidesivir - BCX4430**

Galidesivir (BCX4430) is a broad-spectrum antiviral in advanced development for the treatment of viruses that pose a threat to health and national security, including SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of COVID-19), Ebola, Marburg, Yellow Fever and Zika.

The NIAID and BARDA have been funding the development and testing of Galidesivir for over 15 years as they recognize its importance in preparation for all future pandemics. The 31st of August, 2020 NIAID Awarded $44 Million Contract to Advance Development of Galidesivir.

Galidesivir has also demonstrated broad-spectrum activity in vitro against more than 20 ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses in nine different families, including coronaviruses, filoviruses, togaviruses, bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, paramyxoviruses and flaviviruses. (Hepatitis C, West Nile, Dengue, Jap Encephalitis, Yellow Fever, TBEV, OHFV, and Zika), orthomyxoviruses and picornaviruses..

Galidesivir is the first antiviral that has ever shown such potential, and to top it off, it is now known from the Phase I trial and now the Brazil part 1 trial to clearly be safe and show dose-sensitive effects in people. And based on multiple animal studies, it works equally effectively as a pill that is stable for years at room temperature. Not only that, but this antiviral, unlike any of the others, has excellent penetration of the blood brain barrier as was seen in the macaque Zika virus study.

&#x200B;

* **4.3.1 Efficacy**

Galidesivir was safe and generally well tolerated in Phase 1 clinical safety and pharmacokinetics trials by both intravenous and intramuscular routes of administration in healthy subjects. In animal studies, galidesivir has demonstrated survival benefits against a variety of serious pathogens, including Ebola, Marburg, Yellow Fever and Zika viruses.

The company on December 22nd announced that all three doses were perfectly safe for the patients. In addition, they found that patients had a dose-sensitive reduction in virus levels in their lungs. They went on to say that an animal model, showed that Galidesivir significantly reduced COVID-19-associated lung damage.

&#x200B;

* **4.3.2 Galidesivir value**

We must have in mind that Galidesivir is a Government funded bio-defense drug, that aims to treat a wide range of viruses as explained before. Its global stockpiling for future pandemics is also an absolute certainty given its long-term stability. With all the given explanations, conservatively talking Galidesivir can not be worth less than ***$1B this is 5,67$***.

&#x200B;

[Galidesivir value: 5,67$ SP](https://preview.redd.it/cylw2s73up171.png?width=1014&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ea63ebda1f07ddc72762ad137ec92ac17bb87f7)

&#x200B;

**○ 4.4 FOP - BCX9250**

FOP is an ultra-rare, severely disabling condition characterized by the irregular formation of bone outside the normal skeleton, also known as heterotopic ossification (HO). HO can occur in muscles, tendons and soft tissue. Patients with FOP become bound by this irregular ossification over time, with restricted movement and fused joints, resulting in deformities and premature mortality. There are currently no approved treatments for FOP.

There are an estimated 3,500 to 9,000 patients worldwide, with 900 diagnosed so far. Currently there aren’t any approved treatments.

Market size for this treatment is estimated to reach 500M-900M in 2025, growing to 3B in 2028 as more patients are diagnosed. With a price ranging from $900K-$1M/year.

Last December the 21st Biocryst announced positive Phase 1 results

“BCX9250 was safe and well tolerated at all doses studied, with linear and dose-proportional exposure supporting once-daily dosing.”.

“In preclinical studies, BCX9250 demonstrated potency for the target kinase, selectivity, safety and strong suppression of HO in animal models.”

&#x200B;

* **4.4.1 BCX9250 Value**

BCX9250 study will most likely take 4 years to finish, this is, until 2025. By then the potential market we will be aimming for, will be $750,000,000 aprox.

Drugs that are in Phase 1 studies are said to have a 10% chance of making it to the market. Following that, BCX9250 as of now shuld be valued at ***$75,000,000 = 0.43$***

**○ 4.5 Oral Factor D inhibitor - BCX9930**

&#x200B;

BCX9930 is a novel, ***oral***, potent and selective small molecule ***inhibitor of Factor D*** which recently completed Phase 1 clinical development for the treatment of complement-mediated diseases.

The 3rd of August 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted ***Fast Track designation*** for oral Factor D inhibitor, BCX9930.

***This is how Bill Sheridan*** ( *Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President )* defined [BCX9930 in the last conference call ( 22:00 )](https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/mqqo89/bcrx_biocryst_apr_14_2021_at_845_am_edt_20th/)

***""BCX9930 is a really terrifically exciting project, this is a potent specific Factor D inhibitor. So, the mechanism of action is to block the enzymatic activity of that complement enzyme, that enzyme sits at the very start of the alternative pathway of complement. So, that opens up a whole set of opportunities across diferent diseases that are driven by dysregulation of that alternative pathway of complement and the amplification loop that's embedded in that pathway""***

&#x200B;

* **4.5.1** **Staff excitement**

Staff team from Biocryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc seem to be really positive and ***excited*** about the incoming ***future of BCX9930***. Such excitement has been seen in the last conference calls where staff members such as the CEO Jon P.Stonehouse, or the Vice President, William P.Sheridan would say the ***following words.***

&#x200B;

***“Embarrassment of riches”***

***“We agree with Alexion that creating a potent specific and great oral Factor D inhibitor is a great challenge, and we are happy we have one”***

***“My only concern is i have no concerns”***

***“Pipeline in a molecule”***

***“My aim is to make c5 inhibitors obsolete”***

***“This is Big”***

""***BCX9930 is a really terrifically exciting project""***

&#x200B;

* **4.5.2** **Phase I study**

On March 22, 2021 BCRX announced that ***BCX9930 will be advancing from Ph1 to*** ***Pivotal*** ***Trials in PNH*** ***following the successful proof of concept trial.***

The company announced that a ***Pivotal trial for PNH***, and ***proof of concept trials*** in renal complement-mediated diseases are expected to begin in ***2H 2021.***

On March 22, the company unveiled BCX9930 ***Ph1 data***. The most relevant information from that Ph1 is mentioned below.

""***100%*** of treatment-naïve patients and **83%** of C5 inhibitor inadequate response patients were ***transfusion-free***. *Prior to the trial*, 22 percent of treatment-naïve patients and 17 percent of C5 inadequate responders were transfusion-free ""

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ybrsazv9up171.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=71a0ca39992d0ced02c0f723601e3fd784b92dd4

"" ***Hemoglobin levels increased*** by a mean of ***3.5 g/dL*** in treatment-naïve patients and ***3.2 g/dL*** in C5 inhibitor inadequate response patients; at last visit, mean hemoglobin levels were 11.8 g/dL and 12.2 g/dL, respectively ""

To understand properly how ***positive BCX9930 data was***, below you can find a photo that gathers the data from the main studies done in this kind of inhibitors. What mainly should catch your attention is the ***Hemoglobin change from baseline and the % of transfusion units reduction from baseline*** \- This data has been gathered by ***Barclays***.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* **4.5.3  BCX9930 Study Primary End point change agreement with the FDA**

Recently the FDA changed the ***primary end-point*** of the BCX9930 study, for it to be the ***change of Hemoglobin level from baseline***. The ***secondary end-point would be the % transfusion free rate reduction.***

This news ***greatly benefit BCX9930's study*** considering how it has ***showed the strongest results in those 2 mentioned study end-points.***

&#x200B;

* **4.5.4 Alternative Pathway**

What makes BCX9930 a game changer, is the wide spectrum of Alternative Pathway Dysregulation disease it can treat. It can treat up to[ 8 diseases](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 26) as of now, that's why insiders call it ***“Pipeline in a molecule”***. Those ***8 diseases*** are shown in the pic below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/voe1863eup171.png?width=1273&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d8a29deed5089d09d8d6669e8b847894d74c786

1- PNH (Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria)

2 - aHUS (Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome)

3 - ANCA vasculitis (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis)

4 - Lupus Nephritis

5 - IgAN vasculitis

6 - C3G (Glomerulonephritis)

7 - PMN (Primary membranous nephropathy)

8 - IgAN (IgA nephropathy)

&#x200B;

* **4.5.5 Potential market size by 2025**

Assuming BCX9930 will be approved by 2025, and it will be able to treat the previously mentioned 8 diseases, we reach to the following conclusion. The potential ***market size BCX9930*** will be aiming for by 2025 scores up to ***$28,56B - $51B / year.*** This numbers are explained below, stating the yearly market size each of those 8 diseases aim for.

&#x200B;

1 - 2 "" Due to COVID-19, the market for ***PNH and aHUS*** was anticipated to grow from US$ 4855 million in 2020 to US$ ***7023 million*** by 2026; it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.89% during 2021–2026.""

3 - “ ***Anca vasculitis*** prevalence in the USA rounds 10-20 per million = 3300-6600 patients. As a treatment example we use Soliris, which costs $500,000/year. We would aim for ***1,65B - 3.3B*** market size as of now. Expected to grow by 2025""

4 - “"" The global systemic ***lupus erythematosus*** market size is expected to reach ***USD 3.08 billion*** by 2025, according to a new report by Grand View Research, Inc., exhibiting a CAGR of 7.0% during the forecast period. ""

5 - 8 “""***IgAN.*** The gathered disease prevalence data varies according to in which coutry the study has been undergone. Data gathered from the undergone study in East Asia, show the prevalence rounds 45 / million. meaning 14,850 patients, or a potential ***7,25B*** market size using Soliris's yearly price ""

6 - ""***C3G:*** Prevalence in the USA round 14-140 per 1M people = 4620-46,200 patients. If those patients were to be treated with Soliris which costs $500,000 / year, the potential market size we aim for rounds ***2,31B - 23,1B*** ""

7 - "" ***PMN*** prevalence is similar to the one of IgAN, so we would potentially aim for a similar market size, meaning ***7.25B***""

&#x200B;

* **4.5.6 Alexion buy out**

On December the 12th, 2020 ***Alexion announced that AstraZeneca was going to buy them out for 39B***. More than ***90% of their revenue come from their “""""Factor D""""” C5 inhibitor,*** being that the main reason why AstraZeneca wanted that buy out to happen.

You might think, why does this matter? Well, remember we have a Factor D which has shown to be more effective than Alexion’s, and is able to treat more diseases than they do aswell. This buy out reflects how ***undervalued BCX9930 is.***

Apart from the buy out, I think it's essential to mention that ***Alexion bought Achillion's ""Factor D"" when it was in Ph2 for $930MM.***

In ***2019*** Alexion's SOLIRIS® (eculizumab) net product sales were ***$3,946.4 million***. Soliris is currently approved to treat ***PNH and aHUS***. Have in mind BCX9930 is able to treat 8 diseases, aiming for a wider market, while having greater efficacy/safety profile.

As a quick ***example***, using the average biotech mid-cap ***x7*** revenue multiplier, and the revenue ***Soliris*** managed to generate in 2019, ***3,964B = 27,748B***. It would mean a ***SP value of $157.56*** for ***BCRX***. I want to make clear again that BCX9930 is said to be best in-class treatment and it's able to treat more diseases, therefore aims for a bigger revenue opportunity.

&#x200B;

* **4.5.7 Soliris/Ultomoris patients survey**

BCRX recently did a ***survey with 23 patients***, 12 of them using ***Ultomiris*** and the other 11 ***Soliris.*** The survey showed that ***91% of the patients were interested in switching*** due to the reasons explained in the pic below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6wsb9hchup171.png?width=1448&format=png&auto=webp&s=d92b1a169e593a7ac3152237092e3efd8468ee70

Some of the ***patients treated with BCX9930*** were asked some questions, among them, the ***6th*** one expressed his ***desire to be able to be treated with BCX9930 oral pill.*** As we have seen it before with Orladeyo, patients are ***highly willing to switch from needles to oral-pill*** form treatments.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* **4.5.8 BCX9930 From a Ph1 to a Ph3**

&#x200B;

On March 22, 2021 BCX9930 PNH Ph1 data was shown, the obtained ***results were so good that it enabled BCX9930 jump from a*** ***Ph1 to a pivotal Ph3 trial in PNH***\*\*\*, totally skipping the Ph2.\*\*\*

Additional ***proof of concept BCX9930*** ***Ph2 trials in Renal Complement-Mediated diseases*** will be made.

Straight ***jumping from a*** ***ph1 to a pivotal ph3*** trial, is something that's ***not common in the bio world*** and could be taken as a really ***bullish sign***. Apart from it being a bullish sign, it ***accelerates the process of development of the drug***, giving it a chance to ***hit the market in a smaller span of ti***

&#x200B;

* **4.5.9** **BCX9930 valuation**

Having in mind BCX9930 is a ***potential*** ***best-in-class treatment***, that Alexion got bought out for 39B mainly for their “Factor D” c5 inhibitor, and the yearly market size BCX9930 aims for in 2025 rounds the $28,56B - $51B mark. BCX9930 valuation can not be less than a ***30% of Alexion’s buy out price***, this is ***11.7B meaning 66.44$.***

&#x200B;

[BCX9930 value: 66.44$ SP](https://preview.redd.it/phh7inljup171.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2994d05aec97ea91d0e085ed352ce68ce2c217c)

&#x200B;

* **5. Strong BO Buy Out candidate**

As we have explained in the Institutional section before, all good bio-tech investors do know who Alexander ***J.Denner founder of Sarissa Capital*** is. After recently ***increasing his stake in BCRX***, along with BlackRock, he now ***owns a 5%*** of Biocryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Denner, has increased his position in BCRX by an stunning ***789% in the last 3 quarters***, showing ***strong conviction*** in the company.

Since Denner opened his position in Alexion, it took him 5 months to close the buy out deal, as shown in the picture below

📷

https://preview.redd.it/of897ahmup171.png?width=1300&format=png&auto=webp&s=abc2123461c38ce6d62c8320916416b87267db02

After this exhaustive analysis on the company, we can easily acknowledge that BCRX is more than a ***strong BO candidate***. A buy out coming from ***BIIB***, company ***where Denner forms part of the BOD board of directors,*** would make total sense ***in the following 2 years*** once BCX9930 Factor D phase III data is unveiled.

It also is important to mention that ***Bank of America added BCRX to the list of top M&A candidates ( Mergers and Acquisitions )*** as of October 30th, 2020. Stating how they believe BCRX will have a ***strong revenue growth in the incoming years.***

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* **6. Alexion's performance with Soliris**

As we have explained before, Alexion Pharmaceuticals has its own """"""""Factor D"""""""" C5 inhibitor inhibitor called Soliris.

Alexion could be the perfect example to have an idea of what we could expect from Biocryst's in the incoming years. ***From 2007 to 2014 Alexion's stock price grew a 1777%***. Being valued at ***10.5$ in 2007 and 186.6$ in 2014.***

Revenue generated by Alexion gradually grew up as their Factor D was approved to treat additional diseases, and the market size it captured became wider.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6ix67squup171.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4bf5e078a9461e9e4c067833d7af2f9d802da8f

Biocryst Pharmaceuticals managing to do the SP move Alexion did, is more than ***doable*** with the unique pipeline it possess. Having in mind ***Alexion made 66.4 MM revenue the first year while BCRX expects to generate 500 MM plus with Orladeyo,*** apart from it, additional revenue generated by ***Rapivab/Galidesivir stockpillings*** may come. Incoming Earning Reports are meant to be potential catalysts for the company, gradually becoming more meaningful as the market size they capture with Orladeyo becomes wider.

&#x200B;

* **7.** **De-risked company**

Last December the 7th, 2020 BCRX announced they made a Royalty ***agreement with Royalty Pharma and Athyrium Capital Management.*** With this agreement BCRX was funded with ***$325,000,000 in order to support Orladeyo launch***. Setting the company in an attractive position of ***not needing to do any money rising ""Offering"".***

***Jon Stonehouse CEO***, also confirmed that the company will ***not need to do offerings anymore.*** The fact that the company is already generating revenue with Orladeyo is another strong evidence that confirms money risings will not be needed anymore.

It's important to restate that as part of the Royalty agreement, ***Royalty Pharma will receive a 1% on global net sales of BCX9930, if approved.*** Showing how ***bullish they are on BCX9930*** and their willingness to invest at it.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gezetorvup171.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6880f64de595b224faf806b09f22385ba88dabf

&#x200B;

* **8. Forward looking statements**

&#x200B;

1. From now on ***EarningReports should be catalysts and positive for the company,*** obtaining better results each quarter as the company settles down and receives additional approvals for Orladeyo in different countries.
2. Orladeyo ***European launch.***
3. The company will have to provide some colour on the ***BCX9930 PNH pivotal trial***, how it will be planned etc etc... Aswell as the ***PH2 trials*** in complement-mediated diseases.
4. ***BCX9250 Next steps*** should soon be shared by the company
5. ***BCX4430 Galidesivir*** recently completed a Ph1, additional information about the study may be given. It's important to mention that this study was fully funded by the NIAID.
6. ***Galidesivir/Rapivab stockpilling.***

&#x200B;

*From now on revenues/BCX9930 updates are the main catalysts.*

&#x200B;

* **9. Conclusion**

After this exhaustive analysis, we come to the conclusion that ***BCRX is severely undervalued***, and if we sum up the true value of the pipeline, it should be valued around ***180$***. The StockPrice fair value number will keep growing as we keep getting data updates from the on-going studies and Orladeyo revenues keep growing, making it an ***excellent long-term hold and buy out candidate.***

I currently do have a position in this company, my average entry price being around the 4$ range. My initial plan is to hold the shares for the long term, at least 2 years more provided that we don't get bought out earlier. I expect the StockPrice to keep rising as Orladeyo revenues flow in and BCX9930 trials keep progressing, aswell as the rest of the pipeline.",nmfr14,BCRX DD - The Embarrassment of Riches

""To start the day our EquityHub options model was telling us that nearly 30% of total AMC gamma expired tomorrow, 5/28. We think that number shifts to 50% based on the wild volume taking place today. Because so much gamma expires tomorrow we think that AMC will likely consolidate as call options decay kicks in, which allows dealers to unwind some of their long stock hedge position.""

**TL;DR:** 

**Buy CHWY 06/11 75.5/76 Strangle**  

**Sell before market close on June 10**  


CHWY Earnings is June 10 AMC [Source](https://investor.chewy.com/news-and-events/news/news-details/2021/Chewy-Announces-Fiscal-First-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results-Conference-Call/default.aspx)

As the earnings announcement gets closer, the implied volatility (IV) should increase. Now Vega--the greek responsible for the jiggle factor--reflects the option price's sensitivity to the change in IV. Higher IV means higher options price.   


IV:

* Last Earnings Call (March 30, 2021): \~75%
* Currently (May 27, 2021): 58.2%
* Difference: 16.8%

  
Options Contracts:

* 06/11 75.5P
   * Vega: 0.061
   * Current Price: $4.15
   * Expected price increase due to vega: (0.061 \* 16.8) = $1.02
* 06/11 76C
   * Vega: 0.061
   * Current Price: $4.05
   * Expected price increase due to vega: (0061 \* 16.8) = $1.02  


Total Entry Price: $8.20/contract  
Total Price Increase due to vega: $2.04  


Expected ROI: 24.8%  


Sell before June 10 market close. 

&#x200B;

Positions:

* CHWY 06/11 76C @ 4.05
* CHWY 06/11 75.5P @ 4.15  


The bid-ask spread touched me in my no-no square. Vega will help make it back.

It is currently trading at Book Value (finviz, feel free to correct me on this), and is in the process of successfully deleveraging it's debt (rising stock prices would help with this process creating a virtuous cycle). Throw in its forward P/E of 7.36 and it looks very cheap in this most irrational of markets.

After the decimation of the US oil industry last year, CRK is also profiting nicely from their oil reserves. And with OPEC constantly pushing for higher prices, this will continue for the foreseeable future.

Short interest is currently at around 20% (finviz short number x 2, which seems to be correct). Options IV is under 40%. This is one of the last true value plays in the Energy Sector. The timing is right, come get some!

Make what you can with these crazy markets. If we ever return to slower times it will go much slower. 

Try to make smart plays with 90 percent of your money and use 10 percent for your amc and crazy type plays.

Because if people sell on friday your shares will be null and won't count towards the total shares held by retail. Thus helping to hide the amount of synthetic/fake shares hedgies have injected into amc.

And no, shorts surprisingly have not covered. Yesterday, amc had 90 million short volume and si actually went up the past few days. Amc had went up 20% and shorters lost over $700 million. 

Now today amc runs up to 36%? Shorters are fuk, and they fucking dumb too",,

For example, if you put all that 365k into SPY, assume an 11% average yearly return for 10 years with dividends reinvested and you'd have about 1 million in 10 years without adding anymore money. 

That's not including the 150k more that OP made and it's not including any further investment. If you just take OPs 500k and put it into SPY, use the 10% lifetime historical average return, add no extra money to it AND don't reinvest your dividends, they'd be just shy of a million in 8 years.

Because if people sell on friday your shares will be null and won't count towards the total shares held by retail. Thus helping to hide the amount of synthetic/fake shares hedgies have injected into amc.

And shorts surprisingly have not covered. Yesterday, amc had 90 million short volume and si actually went up the past few days. Amc had went up 20% and shorters lost over $700 million that day alone. 

Now today amc runs up to 36%? Shorters are fuk, and they fucking dumb too",,

So when I bought the $15.50 call the stock price was around $13 and I paid $.59 ($59) per contract. So at the time of my purchase the break-even price would be $16.09. (15.50 strike price plus .59) ... 

Now immediately after I bought it the stock price went up to $15.50. I then sold the calls for $1.12 each because value of the contracts go up in relation to the stock price. So the person who bought them from me would need the stock price to get to $16.72 ($15.50+$1.12). 

So I took the money from my calls and I rolled them to cheaper options which were $18 strike price calls that only cost .55 ($55) per contract. So I was betting that the price was going to go above $18.55 by expiration day Friday. It allowed me to buy more contracts at a cheaper price but with a lot more risk because I don't know if the price was going to go past 18. 

I hope this makes some sense it's kind of hard to explain over a Reddit post.",,

You have to wait for the shares to settle so you can't do it all in one day. But maybe if you rollover the cash it would be faster. The goal of doing the rollover is that you aren't allowed to fund a Roth IRA if your income is high enough in that year. If GME/AMC shoots the moon then your straight Roth deposit would be invalid.

By putting it in a traditional first, then rolling it over, you can bypass the income requirements.

And shorts surprisingly have not covered. Yesterday, amc had 90 million short volume and si actually went up the past few days. Amc had went up 20% and shorters lost over $700 million that day alone.

Because if people sell on friday your shares will be null and won't count towards the total shares held by retail. Thus helping to hide the amount of synthetic/fake shares hedgies have injected into amc.

And shorts surprisingly have not covered. Yesterday, amc had 90 million short volume and si actually went up the past few days. Amc had went up 20% and shorters lost over $700 million that day alone. 

Now today amc runs up to 36%? Shorters are fuk, and they fucking dumb too",,

3866,gzonlv9,2021-05-27 21:19:09,t1_gzonlv9,t1_gzolel4,wallstreetbets,"Sure. Let’s ignore whether there are hidden shorts, fails to deliver, etc. etc. for a second. For purposes of this discussion, I will concede the validity of all of that due diligence (even though I think 99.9% of it is complete nonsense, just for full disclosure). 

During the first short squeeze at the end of January, large swaths of retail were disallowed from buying GME which ultimately alleviated the squeeze. There is zero reason to suspect this wouldn’t happen again. If hedge funds, the DTC and brokerages really are staring at potential insolvency and financial collapse, there’s nothing they won’t do to prevent it. Likewise with the SEC itself. They will not let a single stock bring down the global economy - they’ll halt trading in it long before that happens. So what if they have to go testify in front of Congress again - they’ll still be in business and people will move on. Retail simply does not have a way to counter this. Retail is playing a game where if by some stroke of luck they caught lightning in a bottle again, hedge funds, brokerages and the SEC would change the rules again before the squeeze approached anything resembling $1,000,000 a share. It’s not going to happen - it’s a pipe dream.",,

Because if people sell on friday your shares will be null and won't count towards the total shares held by retail. Thus helping to hide the amount of synthetic/fake shares hedgies have injected into amc.

And shorts surprisingly have not covered. Yesterday, amc had 90 million short volume and si actually went up the past few days. Amc had went up 20% and shorters lost over $700 million that day alone.

Because if people sell on friday your shares will be null and won't count towards the total shares held by retail. Thus helping to hide the amount of synthetic/fake shares hedgies have injected into amc.

And shorts surprisingly have not covered. Yesterday, amc had 90 million short volume and si actually went up the past few days. Amc had went up 20% and shorters lost over $700 million that day alone. 

Now today amc runs up to 36%? Shorters are fuk, and they fucking dumb too",,

Watching the hedgies fight it and make it stronger is also very satisfying but the charts show gme will win and very soon they will be a $1,000+ stock permanently due to the number of people who just wont sell ever.

Because if people sell on friday your shares will be null and won't count towards the total shares held by retail. Thus helping to hide the amount of synthetic/fake shares hedgies have injected into amc.

And shorts surprisingly have not covered. Yesterday, amc had 90 million short volume and si actually went up the past few days. Amc had went up 20% and shorters lost over $700 million that day alone. 

Now today amc runs up to 36%? Shorters are fuk, and they fucking dumb too",,

“Smart money” traders went to schools that taught to sell to lower the price. But degenerate apes are not respecting that principle. Stock goes up apes buy, stock goes down apes buy more. This unknown behavior is making them dig a bigger hole.

So retarded it's brilliant.  

This is why you Buy and Hold. 
Don't be shocked if they cause panic tomorrow.   They are dying for people to sell off their position with the June 2nd stock count starting.  If your stock isn't settled into your account by then, then you won't be counted for those shares. 

Today wasn't even  remotely a squeeze. Just Retail FOMO glomming  on.  Imagine a day with 1 billion in volume.  

Shorts lost over 800m just today on AMC, and are still doing it- which means they haven't even begun to cover.   

The next few weeks are huge, but the rules are simple.  
1. Buy
2. Hold 

Enjoy today's success! 
To many more 🥒

hedge funds, market makers, etc. -> banks -> DTCC -> Federal Reserve and/or Federal Government (Treasury)

If a hedge fund can’t stay afloat, they get liquidated and that money goes to covering the costs of their outstanding liabilities (including buying shares to close short positions). If that’s not enough, the entity that margin called them (e.g. a bank) will have to pay the difference. If the bank can’t stay afloat, then they will also get liquidated (or get a bailout or get acquired by a competitor).

If the group of all involved entities fails (hedge funds and banks and whoever else that has outstanding short positions), then the DTCC has to pay the costs…i.e. buy the shares to close out short positions. The DTCC reported has a $63Trillion insurance policy. If that fails, then the FR/Treasury have to step in.

Note: i’m repeating/summarizing part of the DD that is available in the other subs, so apologies if i got something wrong. But the gist of it is: someone is always responsible and will have to pay to close out the outstanding short positions.",,

MT5 trades use static margins which don't change for a position once opened. In a demo account whenever you open a position, you will have a column telling you the margin.
Your account value has to be always above that value.

If it goes below that value, you will get a mail, to put more money in. If you didn't and you account value drops further, reducing the account value at 50% of margin number, your positions will be closed.

Because if people sell on friday your shares will be null and won't count towards the total shares held by retail. Thus helping to hide the amount of synthetic/fake shares hedgies have injected into amc.

And shorts surprisingly have not covered. Yesterday, amc had 90 million short volume and si actually went up the past few days. Amc had went up 20% and shorters lost over $700 million that day alone. 

Now today amc runs up to 36%? Shorters are fuk, and they fucking dumb too",,

On one hand, just because something has a 1 in 50 chance doesn't mean it'll happen within 50 attempts. It could take 100 attempts or 200 attempts. Theoretically, you could try it a million times and not succeed once (although this is very unlikely). So, you'd probably want to have enough money for more than 50 attempts. On the other hand, in reality there are more outcomes possible than simply either winning $500k or losing all of your money. You could pull your money out early if things don't look good and cut your losses. You might also have some attempts that result in smaller wins than $500k. Like, maybe you turn your $10k into $20k.

If you are looking for some extensive and detailed DD on the company, this is the article you're looking for, and I highly suggest you keep reading it. In case you find the given information useful, I encourage you to support the article in order to reach more people and rise awareness of how undervalued BCRX is.

Before starting to read the article, my suggestion is to ***focus more on Orladeyo and BCX9930***, since both of them are the ***most valuable assests of the company*** at the moment.

If you want to learn more about the company ***check out***[ ***u/bio9999***](https://www.reddit.com/u/bio9999/) ***and the community***[ ***r/BCRX***](https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/)***,*** some of the informartion related with Galidesivir directly come from bio9999's posts.

Basically BCRX went up a 10% today because it was mentioned in multiple Reddit/FOMO related articles. Those companies mentioned in the article were referred to as 'memes' , including BCRX.

Well, BCRX ain't a meme at all. In fact it potentially could be the most solid investment in the Bio-world in terms of Risk/Reward. The reasons will be explained in this article.

&#x200B;

**○ 4.1 Orladeyo**™ **(Berotralstat) oral pill**

&#x200B;

Orladeyo is the ***first Oral approved*** treatment used to prevent swelling attacks in people with ***hereditary angioedema (HAE)*****,** disease which is estimated to affect ***1 in 50,000 people***

&#x200B;

\- Orladeyo was firstly approved in the ***USA*** ***December the 3rd,*** ***2020. Q4***

\- Orladeyo received ***Japan*** NHI price listing approval ***April the 14th, 2021. Q2***

\- Orladeyo received ***Europe*** approval ***April the 30th, 2021 Q2***

\- Orladeyo received ***UK*** approval ***May the 12th, 2021 Q2***

&#x200B;

***CEO*** himself Jon Stonehouse ***confirmed*** in the [last conference call, ( 22:15 )](https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/mqqo89/bcrx_biocryst_apr_14_2021_at_845_am_edt_20th/) ***Orladeyo will annually*** be generating ***$500MM plus revenue.***

\-Serge Belanger ( ***Analyst*** ): I think in the past you've talked about ***sales potential for Orladeyo of 500 million plus***, are you still reiterating that target?

\- Stonehouse ( ***CEO*** ): ***Yeah make sure you remember the plus.***

&#x200B;

***Orladeyo*** is [ranked](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/pharmacy/20-most-expensive-prescription-drugs-in-2021.html) the ***#13 most expensive drug*** ***in the USA*** market. ***$37,308*** is approximately what patients must monthly pay to access the drug.

&#x200B;

***Before oral Orladeyo*** was approved for HAE, ***patients*** would only have treatments that required usage of ***needles***. This dramatically ***reduced the*** ***quality of their life***, making some of them quit using the treatment. That's the main ***reason*** why ***Orladeyo is a game changer***.

&#x200B;

As it's shown in[ the January 2021 Corporate Presentation](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 16), Physicians expect to Prescribe ***Orladeyo for over 40% of HAE Patients.***

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v12offyttp171.png?width=1241&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8b373280fbf16a18d895232c4337554ea1d03db

&#x200B;

* **4.1.1** **Pricings/Revenue**

&#x200B;

**USA**

In the USA there currently are 10,000 patients, ***7500 diagnosed and treated,*** 1700 diagnosed but not treated, 600 treated but not diagnosed.

Physicians expect to prescribe Orladeyo for over 41% of HAE patients. Conservatively thinking, taking 7,500 patients ( the diagnosed and treated ones ) out of the total 10,000 pool in the USA, with over[ 41% of patients prescription](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) ( page 16 ) we would conservatively aim for ***3,075 patients.***

The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in the USA, is equal to ***485,000$***

&#x200B;

**Japan**

On November the 5th Biocryst undergone an agreement with ***Torii Pharmaceuticals.*** A local Japanese company that will be in charge of getting new patients to be treated with Orladeyo in Japan and commerzialing it.

Japan has around 2,500 HAE patients, and Biocryst conservatively expects to ***at*** ***least reach 500 patients.***

The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in Japan, is equal to ***$248,500***

***Approval of Orladeyo in Japan issued a $15MM milestone payment*** from Torii.

***BioCryst will receive*** tiered royalties ranging from ***20% - 40% of Japanese sales.***

&#x200B;

**Europe**

It's estimated to be around ***12,000 HAE patients in Europe.*** Following the physician prescription of over[ 41% of patients to prescribe](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 16) for Orladeyo. We get a total of ***4,920 patients*** in Europe.

Since pricings and jurisdictions work in a different way in Europe, the amount of money each patient will have to pay for Orladeyo is expected to be around or above Japan's ***$248,500/year.*** This number should soon be confirmed.

With this yearly prices and the amount of patients defined before, we get the following results.

&#x200B;

\- ***USA - 3,075p x 485K = 1,491,375,000$***

\- ***Japan - 500p x 248,5K = 124,250,000$***

\- ***EU - 4,920p x 248,5K = 1,222,620,000$***

&#x200B;

Summing it all up we get $2,751,270,000. From that number we have to subtract 123,100,000$ making it a total of ***$2,628,170,000***. The sustraction happens as a result of the undergone Royalty agreement with Torii Pharmaceuticals and Royalty Pharma.

&#x200B;

* **4.1.2 Q1 EarningsReport Beat**

&#x200B;

On May the 6th, 2021 BCRX presented Q1 Earnings Report data which managed to ***Beat Analysts estimates***. Basically what matters from this ***Q1 ER*** is that it was the ***launch of Orladeyo***, and Analysts wanted to see a decent amount of money generated by it. They were expecting Orladeyo sales to top ***$3.1MM*** ***and Orladeyo actually generated*** ***$10.94MM***, this is a ***353% sales beat***

The consequence of the ER beat was an increase of ***24.06%*** in the ***SP***

&#x200B;

It's ***important*** to mention that ***revenues generated this Q1*** only came from the ***USA.***

This ***Q2 Orladeyo*** has been ***approved in Japan/Europe/UK*** aswell, adding new sources of revenue.

***Orladeyo sales*** are expected to ***grow exponentially*** each quarter. Main reason for it is that it has been approved in the countries mentioned above. The other reason is that the amount of ***patients*** they treat will slowly ***score up*** as insurance companies allow their clients to be treated with this drug.

&#x200B;

* **4.1.3 Orladeyo value**

Having in mind the discussed numbers before, Orladeyo alone will be generating ***$2,628,170,000*** a year, using the average mid-cap Biotech company multiplier **x7**. We get a total of ***$18,397,190,000*** meaning an increase of ***$104,46*** in the stock price.

&#x200B;

[Orladeyo value: 104,46$ SP](https://preview.redd.it/9gm01v0ztp171.png?width=1403&format=png&auto=webp&s=fabf3e8b02342dadb174cef96f8428ac44421c7f)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**○ 4.2 Peramivir** ™ **(Rapivab)**

Peramivir (Rapivab) is an antiviral drug for the treatment of influenza. Peramivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor, acting as a transition-state analogue inhibitor of influenza neuraminidase and thereby preventing new viruses from emerging from infected cells. It is approved for intravenous administration.

On 19 December 2014, the FDA approved Peramivir to treat influenza infection in adults. Peramivir has also been approved in Japan and South Korea and is available in Japan as Rapiacta and in South Korea as Peramiflu.

The U.S. government (department of Health and Human Services) gave BioCryst Pharmaceuticals more than $77 million to finish the Phase III clinical development of peramivir. In 2009 the department of Health and Human Services had already given about $180 million to the program.

In 2013 the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA/HHS) released new funding under the current $234.8 million contract to enable completion of a New Drug Application filing for intravenous (IV) peramivir.

&#x200B;

* **4.2.1** **Peramivir value**

With all the explanations given above and having in mind Peramivir is a government bio-defense drug the value of Rapivab can not be less than ***$500,000,000*** conservatively speaking.

&#x200B;

[Peramivir value: $2,84 SP](https://preview.redd.it/gc09kk81up171.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e7fee79582328b95e4db5853fb52c5590dc8b55)

&#x200B;

**○ 4.3 Galidesivir - BCX4430**

Galidesivir (BCX4430) is a broad-spectrum antiviral in advanced development for the treatment of viruses that pose a threat to health and national security, including SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of COVID-19), Ebola, Marburg, Yellow Fever and Zika.

The NIAID and BARDA have been funding the development and testing of Galidesivir for over 15 years as they recognize its importance in preparation for all future pandemics. The 31st of August, 2020 NIAID Awarded $44 Million Contract to Advance Development of Galidesivir.

Galidesivir has also demonstrated broad-spectrum activity in vitro against more than 20 ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses in nine different families, including coronaviruses, filoviruses, togaviruses, bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, paramyxoviruses and flaviviruses. (Hepatitis C, West Nile, Dengue, Jap Encephalitis, Yellow Fever, TBEV, OHFV, and Zika), orthomyxoviruses and picornaviruses..

Galidesivir is the first antiviral that has ever shown such potential, and to top it off, it is now known from the Phase I trial and now the Brazil part 1 trial to clearly be safe and show dose-sensitive effects in people. And based on multiple animal studies, it works equally effectively as a pill that is stable for years at room temperature. Not only that, but this antiviral, unlike any of the others, has excellent penetration of the blood brain barrier as was seen in the macaque Zika virus study.

&#x200B;

* **4.3.1 Efficacy**

Galidesivir was safe and generally well tolerated in Phase 1 clinical safety and pharmacokinetics trials by both intravenous and intramuscular routes of administration in healthy subjects. In animal studies, galidesivir has demonstrated survival benefits against a variety of serious pathogens, including Ebola, Marburg, Yellow Fever and Zika viruses.

The company on December 22nd announced that all three doses were perfectly safe for the patients. In addition, they found that patients had a dose-sensitive reduction in virus levels in their lungs. They went on to say that an animal model, showed that Galidesivir significantly reduced COVID-19-associated lung damage.

&#x200B;

* **4.3.2 Galidesivir value**

We must have in mind that Galidesivir is a Government funded bio-defense drug, that aims to treat a wide range of viruses as explained before. Its global stockpiling for future pandemics is also an absolute certainty given its long-term stability. With all the given explanations, conservatively talking Galidesivir can not be worth less than ***$1B this is 5,67$***.

&#x200B;

[Galidesivir value: 5,67$ SP](https://preview.redd.it/cylw2s73up171.png?width=1014&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ea63ebda1f07ddc72762ad137ec92ac17bb87f7)

&#x200B;

**○ 4.4 FOP - BCX9250**

FOP is an ultra-rare, severely disabling condition characterized by the irregular formation of bone outside the normal skeleton, also known as heterotopic ossification (HO). HO can occur in muscles, tendons and soft tissue. Patients with FOP become bound by this irregular ossification over time, with restricted movement and fused joints, resulting in deformities and premature mortality. There are currently no approved treatments for FOP.

There are an estimated 3,500 to 9,000 patients worldwide, with 900 diagnosed so far. Currently there aren’t any approved treatments.

Market size for this treatment is estimated to reach 500M-900M in 2025, growing to 3B in 2028 as more patients are diagnosed. With a price ranging from $900K-$1M/year.

Last December the 21st Biocryst announced positive Phase 1 results

“BCX9250 was safe and well tolerated at all doses studied, with linear and dose-proportional exposure supporting once-daily dosing.”.

“In preclinical studies, BCX9250 demonstrated potency for the target kinase, selectivity, safety and strong suppression of HO in animal models.”

&#x200B;

* **4.4.1 BCX9250 Value**

BCX9250 study will most likely take 4 years to finish, this is, until 2025. By then the potential market we will be aimming for, will be $750,000,000 aprox.

Drugs that are in Phase 1 studies are said to have a 10% chance of making it to the market. Following that, BCX9250 as of now shuld be valued at ***$75,000,000 = 0.43$***

&#x200B;

**○ 4.5 Oral Factor D inhibitor - BCX9930**

&#x200B;

BCX9930 is a novel, ***oral***, potent and selective small molecule ***inhibitor of Factor D*** which recently completed Phase 1 clinical development for the treatment of complement-mediated diseases.

The 3rd of August 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted ***Fast Track designation*** for oral Factor D inhibitor, BCX9930.

***This is how Bill Sheridan*** ( *Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President )* defined [BCX9930 in the last conference call ( 22:00 )](https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/mqqo89/bcrx_biocryst_apr_14_2021_at_845_am_edt_20th/)

***""BCX9930 is a really terrifically exciting project, this is a potent specific Factor D inhibitor. So, the mechanism of action is to block the enzymatic activity of that complement enzyme, that enzyme sits at the very start of the alternative pathway of complement. So, that opens up a whole set of opportunities across diferent diseases that are driven by dysregulation of that alternative pathway of complement and the amplification loop that's embedded in that pathway""***

&#x200B;

* **4.5.1** **Staff excitement**

Staff team from Biocryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc seem to be really positive and ***excited*** about the incoming ***future of BCX9930***. Such excitement has been seen in the last conference calls where staff members such as the CEO Jon P.Stonehouse, or the Vice President, William P.Sheridan would say the ***following words.***

&#x200B;

***“Embarrassment of riches”***

***“We agree with Alexion that creating a potent specific and great oral Factor D inhibitor is a great challenge, and we are happy we have one”***

***“My only concern is i have no concerns”***

***“Pipeline in a molecule”***

***“My aim is to make c5 inhibitors obsolete”***

***“This is Big”***

""***BCX9930 is a really terrifically exciting project""***

&#x200B;

* **4.5.2** **Phase I study**

On March 22, 2021 BCRX announced that ***BCX9930 will be advancing from Ph1 to*** ***Pivotal*** ***Trials in PNH*** ***following the successful proof of concept trial.***

The company announced that a ***Pivotal trial for PNH***, and ***proof of concept trials*** in renal complement-mediated diseases are expected to begin in ***2H 2021.***

On March 22, the company unveiled BCX9930 ***Ph1 data***. The most relevant information from that Ph1 is mentioned below.

""***100%*** of treatment-naïve patients and **83%** of C5 inhibitor inadequate response patients were ***transfusion-free***. *Prior to the trial*, 22 percent of treatment-naïve patients and 17 percent of C5 inadequate responders were transfusion-free ""

"" ***Hemoglobin levels increased*** by a mean of ***3.5 g/dL*** in treatment-naïve patients and ***3.2 g/dL*** in C5 inhibitor inadequate response patients; at last visit, mean hemoglobin levels were 11.8 g/dL and 12.2 g/dL, respectively ""

To understand properly how ***positive BCX9930 data was***, below you can find a photo that gathers the data from the main studies done in this kind of inhibitors. What mainly should catch your attention is the ***Hemoglobin change from baseline and the % of transfusion units reduction from baseline*** \- This data has been gathered by ***Barclays***.

* **4.5.3  BCX9930 Study Primary End point change agreement with the FDA**

Recently the FDA changed the ***primary end-point*** of the BCX9930 study, for it to be the ***change of Hemoglobin level from baseline***. The ***secondary end-point would be the % transfusion free rate reduction.***

This news ***greatly benefit BCX9930's study*** considering how it has ***showed the strongest results in those 2 mentioned study end-points.***

&#x200B;

* **4.5.4 Alternative Pathway**

What makes BCX9930 a game changer, is the wide spectrum of Alternative Pathway Dysregulation disease it can treat. It can treat up to[ 8 diseases](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 26) as of now, that's why insiders call it ***“Pipeline in a molecule”***. Those ***8 diseases*** are shown in the pic below.

1- PNH (Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria)

2 - aHUS (Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome)

3 - ANCA vasculitis (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis)

4 - Lupus Nephritis

5 - IgAN vasculitis

6 - C3G (Glomerulonephritis)

7 - PMN (Primary membranous nephropathy)

8 - IgAN (IgA nephropathy)

&#x200B;

* **4.5.5 Potential market size by 2025**

Assuming BCX9930 will be approved by 2025, and it will be able to treat the previously mentioned 8 diseases, we reach to the following conclusion. The potential ***market size BCX9930*** will be aiming for by 2025 scores up to ***$28,56B - $51B / year.*** This numbers are explained below, stating the yearly market size each of those 8 diseases aim for.

&#x200B;

1 - 2 "" Due to COVID-19, the market for ***PNH and aHUS*** was anticipated to grow from US$ 4855 million in 2020 to US$ ***7023 million*** by 2026; it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.89% during 2021–2026.""

3 - “ ***Anca vasculitis*** prevalence in the USA rounds 10-20 per million = 3300-6600 patients. As a treatment example we use Soliris, which costs $500,000/year. We would aim for ***1,65B - 3.3B*** market size as of now. Expected to grow by 2025""

4 - “"" The global systemic ***lupus erythematosus*** market size is expected to reach ***USD 3.08 billion*** by 2025, according to a new report by Grand View Research, Inc., exhibiting a CAGR of 7.0% during the forecast period. ""

5 - 8 “""***IgAN.*** The gathered disease prevalence data varies according to in which coutry the study has been undergone. Data gathered from the undergone study in East Asia, show the prevalence rounds 45 / million. meaning 14,850 patients, or a potential ***7,25B*** market size using Soliris's yearly price ""

6 - ""***C3G:*** Prevalence in the USA round 14-140 per 1M people = 4620-46,200 patients. If those patients were to be treated with Soliris which costs $500,000 / year, the potential market size we aim for rounds ***2,31B - 23,1B*** ""

7 - "" ***PMN*** prevalence is similar to the one of IgAN, so we would potentially aim for a similar market size, meaning ***7.25B***""

&#x200B;

* **4.5.6 Alexion buy out**

On December the 12th, 2020 ***Alexion announced that AstraZeneca was going to buy them out for 39B***. More than ***90% of their revenue come from their “""""Factor D""""” C5 inhibitor,*** being that the main reason why AstraZeneca wanted that buy out to happen.

You might think, why does this matter? Well, remember we have a Factor D which has shown to be more effective than Alexion’s, and is able to treat more diseases than they do aswell. This buy out reflects how ***undervalued BCX9930 is.***

Apart from the buy out, I think it's essential to mention that ***Alexion bought Achillion's ""Factor D"" when it was in Ph2 for $930MM.***

In ***2019*** Alexion's SOLIRIS® (eculizumab) net product sales were ***$3,946.4 million***. Soliris is currently approved to treat ***PNH and aHUS***. Have in mind BCX9930 is able to treat 8 diseases, aiming for a wider market, while having greater efficacy/safety profile.

As a quick ***example***, using the average biotech mid-cap ***x7*** revenue multiplier, and the revenue ***Soliris*** managed to generate in 2019, ***3,964B = 27,748B***. It would mean a ***SP value of $157.56*** for ***BCRX***. I want to make clear again that BCX9930 is said to be best in-class treatment and it's able to treat more diseases, therefore aims for a bigger revenue opportunity.

&#x200B;

* **4.5.7 Soliris/Ultomoris patients survey**

BCRX recently did a ***survey with 23 patients***, 12 of them using ***Ultomiris*** and the other 11 ***Soliris.*** The survey showed that ***91% of the patients were interested in switching*** due to the reasons explained in the pic below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6wsb9hchup171.png?width=1448&format=png&auto=webp&s=d92b1a169e593a7ac3152237092e3efd8468ee70

Some of the ***patients treated with BCX9930*** were asked some questions, among them, the ***6th*** one expressed his ***desire to be able to be treated with BCX9930 oral pill.*** As we have seen it before with Orladeyo, patients are ***highly willing to switch from needles to oral-pill*** form treatments.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gvc24l6iup171.png?width=1462&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b2d790ba79514155d5d3a219e22e4ac4793e9a0

&#x200B;

* **4.5.8 BCX9930 From a Ph1 to a Ph3**

&#x200B;

On March 22, 2021 BCX9930 PNH Ph1 data was shown, the obtained ***results were so good that it enabled BCX9930 jump from a*** ***Ph1 to a pivotal Ph3 trial in PNH***\*\*\*, totally skipping the Ph2.\*\*\*

Additional ***proof of concept BCX9930*** ***Ph2 trials in Renal Complement-Mediated diseases*** will be made.

Straight ***jumping from a*** ***ph1 to a pivotal ph3*** trial, is something that's ***not common in the bio world*** and could be taken as a really ***bullish sign***. Apart from it being a bullish sign, it ***accelerates the process of development of the drug***, giving it a chance to ***hit the market in a smaller span of ti***

&#x200B;

* **4.5.9** **BCX9930 valuation**

Having in mind BCX9930 is a ***potential*** ***best-in-class treatment***, that Alexion got bought out for 39B mainly for their “Factor D” c5 inhibitor, and the yearly market size BCX9930 aims for in 2025 rounds the $28,56B - $51B mark. BCX9930 valuation can not be less than a ***30% of Alexion’s buy out price***, this is ***11.7B meaning 66.44$.***

&#x200B;

[BCX9930 value: 66.44$ SP](https://preview.redd.it/phh7inljup171.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2994d05aec97ea91d0e085ed352ce68ce2c217c)

&#x200B;

* **5. Strong BO Buy Out candidate**

As we have explained in the Institutional section before, all good bio-tech investors do know who Alexander ***J.Denner founder of Sarissa Capital*** is. After recently ***increasing his stake in BCRX***, along with BlackRock, he now ***owns a 5%*** of Biocryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Denner, has increased his position in BCRX by an stunning ***789% in the last 3 quarters***, showing ***strong conviction*** in the company.

Since Denner opened his position in Alexion, it took him 5 months to close the buy out deal, as shown in the picture below

📷

https://preview.redd.it/of897ahmup171.png?width=1300&format=png&auto=webp&s=abc2123461c38ce6d62c8320916416b87267db02

After this exhaustive analysis on the company, we can easily acknowledge that BCRX is more than a ***strong BO candidate***. A buy out coming from ***BIIB***, company ***where Denner forms part of the BOD board of directors,*** would make total sense ***in the following 2 years*** once BCX9930 Factor D phase III data is unveiled.

It also is important to mention that ***Bank of America added BCRX to the list of top M&A candidates ( Mergers and Acquisitions )*** as of October 30th, 2020. Stating how they believe BCRX will have a ***strong revenue growth in the incoming years.***

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* **6. Alexion's performance with Soliris**

As we have explained before, Alexion Pharmaceuticals has its own """"""""Factor D"""""""" C5 inhibitor inhibitor called Soliris.

Alexion could be the perfect example to have an idea of what we could expect from Biocryst's in the incoming years. ***From 2007 to 2014 Alexion's stock price grew a 1777%***. Being valued at ***10.5$ in 2007 and 186.6$ in 2014.***

Revenue generated by Alexion gradually grew up as their Factor D was approved to treat additional diseases, and the market size it captured became wider.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6ix67squup171.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4bf5e078a9461e9e4c067833d7af2f9d802da8f

Biocryst Pharmaceuticals managing to do the SP move Alexion did, is more than ***doable*** with the unique pipeline it possess. Having in mind ***Alexion made 66.4 MM revenue the first year while BCRX expects to generate 500 MM plus with Orladeyo,*** apart from it, additional revenue generated by ***Rapivab/Galidesivir stockpillings*** may come. Incoming Earning Reports are meant to be potential catalysts for the company, gradually becoming more meaningful as the market size they capture with Orladeyo becomes wider.

&#x200B;

* **7.** **De-risked company**

Last December the 7th, 2020 BCRX announced they made a Royalty ***agreement with Royalty Pharma and Athyrium Capital Management.*** With this agreement BCRX was funded with ***$325,000,000 in order to support Orladeyo launch***. Setting the company in an attractive position of ***not needing to do any money rising ""Offering"".***

***Jon Stonehouse CEO***, also confirmed that the company will ***not need to do offerings anymore.*** The fact that the company is already generating revenue with Orladeyo is another strong evidence that confirms money risings will not be needed anymore.

It's important to restate that as part of the Royalty agreement, ***Royalty Pharma will receive a 1% on global net sales of BCX9930, if approved.*** Showing how ***bullish they are on BCX9930*** and their willingness to invest at it.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gezetorvup171.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6880f64de595b224faf806b09f22385ba88dabf

&#x200B;

* **8. Forward looking statements**

&#x200B;

1. From now on ***EarningReports should be catalysts and positive for the company,*** obtaining better results each quarter as the company settles down and receives additional approvals for Orladeyo in different countries.
2. Orladeyo ***European launch.***
3. The company will have to provide some colour on the ***BCX9930 PNH pivotal trial***, how it will be planned etc etc... Aswell as the ***PH2 trials*** in complement-mediated diseases.
4. ***BCX9250 Next steps*** should soon be shared by the company
5. ***BCX4430 Galidesivir*** recently completed a Ph1, additional information about the study may be given. It's important to mention that this study was fully funded by the NIAID.
6. ***Galidesivir/Rapivab stockpilling.***

&#x200B;

*From now on revenues/BCX9930 updates are the main catalysts.*

&#x200B;

* **9. Conclusion**

After this exhaustive analysis, we come to the conclusion that ***BCRX is severely undervalued***, and if we sum up the true value of the pipeline, it should be valued around ***180$***. The StockPrice fair value number will keep growing as we keep getting data updates from the on-going studies and Orladeyo revenues keep growing, making it an ***excellent long-term hold and buy out candidate.***

I currently do have a position in this company, my average entry price being around the 4$ range. My initial plan is to hold the shares for the long term, at least 2 years more provided that we don't get bought out earlier. I expect the StockPrice to keep rising as Orladeyo revenues flow in and BCX9930 trials keep progressing, aswell as the rest of the pipeline.",nmfr14,BCRX DD - The Embarrassment of Riches

It is currently trading at Book Value (finviz, feel free to correct me on this), and is in the process of successfully deleveraging it's debt (rising stock prices would help with this process creating a virtuous cycle). Throw in its forward P/E of 7.36 and it looks very cheap in this most irrational of markets.

After the decimation of the US oil industry last year, CRK is also profiting nicely from their oil reserves. And with OPEC constantly pushing for higher prices, this will continue for the foreseeable future.

Short interest is currently at around 20% (finviz short number x 2, which seems to be correct). Options IV is under 40%. This is one of the last true value plays in the Energy Sector. The timing is right, come get some!

Exits for me are laid out in the chart. Assuming I reach a TP I will exit part of the position and then when it cools off for another month or two I will enter again when the technical setup looks good.

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote...

and balking at even a penny of additional liquidity. How the Fed will continue to monetize debt then, when the repo system is now out of collateral, is anyone's guess.

By mid-July, we’ll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase higher yields in the FX swap market amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative

Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks.

Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho.

Ngl this seems like a prettt solid play rn low volume and it’s just been on the slow and steady rise 

This is a real game-changing technology which can offer a real alternative with an interchangeable battery technology for the existing lithium-ion batteries in almost every application with GMG’s Graphene and UQ’s patent-pending aluminum ion battery technology. The current nominal voltage of our batteries is 1.7 volts, and work is being carried out to increase the voltage to directly replace existing batteries and which lead to higher energy densities.

The real differentiator about these batteries is their very high power density of up to 7000 watts/kg, which endows them with a very high charge rate. Furthermore, graphene aluminum-ion batteries provide major benefits in terms of longer battery life (over 2000 charge / discharge cycles testing so far with no deterioration in performance), battery safety (very low fire potential) and lower environmental impact (more recyclable).

graph looks good. good buy. but if u want idk. not a professional buy at ur own risk. yeah.🚀.

Okay! Breakfast came early for You GMG.V Bulls. Its Pencil lead, not crayons today though, although Im hoping that someone with Market DD will post here in a bit and make us some fresh hot crayons. this is my first time on here doing anything like this, so go easy on me:

So here's some stuff I was able to get:

The only person with a science background That I can really find is their CSO:

Ashock Kumar Nanjundan CSO:

Pukyong National University

Degree Name: Doctor of Engineering

Materials Science

Current Adjunct professor at Queensland University (Gotta Do Something for the Kids Right)

Publications:

I’ll Let you guys go to sci hub to download this review for yourself, But the TLDR is that this dude knows his shit on how to dope graphene to get it to work as a battery.

Cited by: 178, For less academic Apes this means that 178 other scientists were like “yeah this dude knows his shit, Imma cite what he’s saying ~basically~ as fact.

https://doi.org/10.1039/C6EE00158K

Ashock’s most cited individual work comes from his first post-doc that he completed in Korea.

Polyaniline-Grafted Reduced Graphene Oxide for Efficient Electrochemical Supercapacitors.

Basically he does some pretty no-brainer synthesys to link graphene and another semi-conducting polymer that really enhances the graphene properties (Pretty nobrainer basic polymer bro shit, even so, it look like he probably wrote good supporting info and saved a lot of people a lot of time).

https://doi.org/10.1021/nn204688c

Total citations for all work combined: 3,845

This is pretty damn good for someone so young.

Here is a research paper that I'm having trouble accessing that seems to be relevant to this company's work on aluminum-graphene based batteries. If anyone can find it, DM me!

https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202010569

All in all, based on what I can see from linkedin about this company, they have a great CSO. He does seem to be both teaching and doing research in academia. He was recently brought up from a “Head Product Scientist” role to a CSO role, so hopefully this change will reflect a move away from more general research and towards really developing this stuff for GMG.V

I’m concerned about product development at this company, specifically it's unclear who is managing it. I’m not able to see every employee linkedin, but it may be that one of the people not visible is leading product development. You might be thinking ~but wait~ what if there is a group of slave PHD students/postdocs at the university of Queensland working on this stuff?  Yes there is. Nanjundan has some connections with the YU group (https://aibn.uq.edu.au/yu.)) And then here is a press release about it. (https://graphenemg.com/gmg-the-university-of-queensland-research-uni-quest-kick-off-the-graphene-enhanced-aluminium-ion-battery-development-project/)

It sounds like the company has recently had some really good results in R&D, but until I can see and Audit the product/process development lead, ill probably avoid going all in $$.

~sometimes~ the COO role at these companies can be a technical role that helps with process development, but the COO looks to be doing mostly operations type stuff and is non-technical. Not wholly worrisome, but I do want to see  more listed employees on linkedin and then someone that is leading doing process development/scale up and quality control… quality assurance wouldn't hurt either.

It also looks like this company is casting a wide net of potential products, but it's entirely unclear if it has launched any of them. Hopefully it does. It feels uncommon these days for a company to go the IPO route so early on in R&D, most will look to do venture capital funding first to launch a few products. Is this an australian thing? Or is this just crowdfunding with extra steps? If you have more info, lets talk

I'm a materials science ape and don't know anything about Stock Market DD, but why not rely on science DD to decide on investments?


Anyway yeah it seems like a solid play. It dipped a bit today but looking at financials i see nothing but greatness for this stock. not financial advice.",nmi3x4,Some more GMG (summary of my last post for those who missed out)

Calculation Formula:  
Margin = current price x trading volume / leverage  
For ex, Its 1% of the contract value for 1:100X leverage  
  
For example, if an account has 1:500 leverage and opens a 1 standard lot (100,000) in EUR/USD, assuming EUR/USD price being 1.19107 then the required margin is as following:  
(100,000\*1.0588)/400 = $238.214

Knowing that this is bound to get some downvotes because some of you will think I'm distracting from the larger MOASS goal, I think it would be wise to read this. 

For over two decades, multiple companies have been trying to get a drug called ""Teplizumab"" approved by the FDA. For various reasons that are very complex, it hasn't been. Today, Provention Bio went in front of an FDA advisory committee to get their blessing on approval. While the FDA is not bound to the committee's recommendations, they very rarely dissent. About 10 minutes ago, the advisory committee voted 10-7 IN FAVOR of approving the drug, however, they had serious concerns about the safety data and would like to run post-marketing trials. 

This is a HUGE win for Provention Bio as it greatly improves the likelyhood of FDA approval which is slated to review Teplizumab on July 2nd. What that means is the stock price is probably going to rocket up tomorrow first thing in the morning (most likely pre-market). Today the FDA halted trading on the stock so the price is still very very temporarily suppressed (it would have cratered if the committee voted no on approval). If I were you, I'd strongly look at this stock. I'm probably going to buy more in the morning.

Because if people sell on friday your shares will be null and won't count towards the total shares held by retail.

And shorts surprisingly have not covered. Yesterday, amc had 90 million short volume and si actually went up the past few days. Amc had went up 20% and shorters lost over $700 million that day alone.

After discussing the value of each drug in the pipeline, we come to the conclusion that ***BCRX s*****hould be** ***valued at $180***. If you are looking for some extensive and detailed DD on the company, this is the article you're looking for, and I highly suggest you keep reading it. In case you find the given information useful, I encourage you to support the article in order to reach more people and rise awareness of how undervalued BCRX is.

Before starting to read the article, my suggestion is to ***focus more on Orladeyo and BCX9930***, since both of them are the ***most valuable assests of the company*** at the moment.

If you want to learn more about the company ***check out***[ ***u/bio9999***](https://www.reddit.com/u/bio9999/) ***and the community***[ ***r/BCRX***](https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/)***,*** some of the informartion related with Galidesivir directly come from bio9999's posts.

&#x200B;

Basically BCRX went up a 10% today because it was mentioned in multiple Reddit/FOMO related articles. Those companies mentioned in the article were referred to as 'memes' , including BCRX.

Well, BCRX ain't a meme at all. In fact it potentially could be the most solid investment in the Bio-world in terms of Risk/Reward. The reasons will be explained in this article.

* **1. About Biocryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.**

Biocryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. BCRX, is a commercial-stage ***drug developer*** headquartered in Durham, North Carolina, that focuses on developing oral therapeutics for ***rare diseases***.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ukxggvumtp171.png?width=352&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fe37bfc930c3f1e95404960b5a8f55b2caea0fe

&#x200B;

* **2. Unique staff team**

The company was founded in 1996 and is currently led by ***Jon P. Stonehouse CEO***, a renowned pharmaceutical executive with over 20 years of thought leadership. Stonehouse previously served as the Senior Vice President of Corporate Development at Merck. Among his numerous accomplishments, Stonehouse was responsible for the game-changing acquisition of Serono S.A in 2007, the largest biotechnology company in Europe at the time.

What makes Jon Stonehouse a ***unique CEO is the*** ***dedication*** ***he has*** ***towards patients*** through his commitment to working faster in order to bring life-saving rare disease therapeutics to patient populations around the world. His passion is further substantiated by the note he had pasted on his monitor during the[ 2021 JPM Healthcare Conference](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/41ee0771-0acc-479e-a39e-2842101c6aa9)

&#x200B;

* **3. Institutional ownership**

Apart from having a stellar management team, what prospective retail investors should also pay close attention to is BioCryst’s rockstar institutional investor syndicate, which includes both generalist industry stalwarts such as ***State Street/BlackRock*** and sector-specialist biotech funds like ***Baker Brothers/Sarissa Capital***.

The photo shown below mention the institutional entities whose ownership in BCRX is equal or above the 5% mark. The numbers given below were posted March 30, 2021.

&#x200B;

**○ 4.1 Orladeyo**™ **(Berotralstat) oral pill**

&#x200B;

Orladeyo is the ***first Oral approved*** treatment used to prevent swelling attacks in people with ***hereditary angioedema (HAE)*****,** disease which is estimated to affect ***1 in 50,000 people***

&#x200B;

\- Orladeyo was firstly approved in the ***USA*** ***December the 3rd,*** ***2020. Q4***

\- Orladeyo received ***Japan*** NHI price listing approval ***April the 14th, 2021. Q2***

\- Orladeyo received ***Europe*** approval ***April the 30th, 2021 Q2***

\- Orladeyo received ***UK*** approval ***May the 12th, 2021 Q2***

&#x200B;

***CEO*** himself Jon Stonehouse ***confirmed*** in the [last conference call, ( 22:15 )](https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/mqqo89/bcrx_biocryst_apr_14_2021_at_845_am_edt_20th/) ***Orladeyo will annually*** be generating ***$500MM plus revenue.***

\-Serge Belanger ( ***Analyst*** ): I think in the past you've talked about ***sales potential for Orladeyo of 500 million plus***, are you still reiterating that target?

\- Stonehouse ( ***CEO*** ): ***Yeah make sure you remember the plus.***

&#x200B;

***Orladeyo*** is [ranked](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/pharmacy/20-most-expensive-prescription-drugs-in-2021.html) the ***#13 most expensive drug*** ***in the USA*** market. ***$37,308*** is approximately what patients must monthly pay to access the drug.

&#x200B;

***Before oral Orladeyo*** was approved for HAE, ***patients*** would only have treatments that required usage of ***needles***. This dramatically ***reduced the*** ***quality of their life***, making some of them quit using the treatment. That's the main ***reason*** why ***Orladeyo is a game changer***.

&#x200B;

As it's shown in[ the January 2021 Corporate Presentation](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 16), Physicians expect to Prescribe ***Orladeyo for over 40% of HAE Patients.***

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v12offyttp171.png?width=1241&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8b373280fbf16a18d895232c4337554ea1d03db

&#x200B;

* **4.1.1** **Pricings/Revenue**

&#x200B;

**USA**

In the USA there currently are 10,000 patients, ***7500 diagnosed and treated,*** 1700 diagnosed but not treated, 600 treated but not diagnosed.

Physicians expect to prescribe Orladeyo for over 41% of HAE patients. Conservatively thinking, taking 7,500 patients ( the diagnosed and treated ones ) out of the total 10,000 pool in the USA, with over[ 41% of patients prescription](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) ( page 16 ) we would conservatively aim for ***3,075 patients.***

The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in the USA, is equal to ***485,000$***

&#x200B;

**Japan**

On November the 5th Biocryst undergone an agreement with ***Torii Pharmaceuticals.*** A local Japanese company that will be in charge of getting new patients to be treated with Orladeyo in Japan and commerzialing it.

Japan has around 2,500 HAE patients, and Biocryst conservatively expects to ***at*** ***least reach 500 patients.***

The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in Japan, is equal to ***$248,500***

***Approval of Orladeyo in Japan issued a $15MM milestone payment*** from Torii.

***BioCryst will receive*** tiered royalties ranging from ***20% - 40% of Japanese sales.***

&#x200B;

**Europe**

It's estimated to be around ***12,000 HAE patients in Europe.*** Following the physician prescription of over[ 41% of patients to prescribe](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 16) for Orladeyo. We get a total of ***4,920 patients*** in Europe.

Since pricings and jurisdictions work in a different way in Europe, the amount of money each patient will have to pay for Orladeyo is expected to be around or above Japan's ***$248,500/year.*** This number should soon be confirmed.

With this yearly prices and the amount of patients defined before, we get the following results.

&#x200B;

\- ***USA - 3,075p x 485K = 1,491,375,000$***

\- ***Japan - 500p x 248,5K = 124,250,000$***

\- ***EU - 4,920p x 248,5K = 1,222,620,000$***

&#x200B;

Summing it all up we get $2,751,270,000. From that number we have to subtract 123,100,000$ making it a total of ***$2,628,170,000***. The sustraction happens as a result of the undergone Royalty agreement with Torii Pharmaceuticals and Royalty Pharma.

&#x200B;

* **4.1.2 Q1 EarningsReport Beat**

&#x200B;

On May the 6th, 2021 BCRX presented Q1 Earnings Report data which managed to ***Beat Analysts estimates***. Basically what matters from this ***Q1 ER*** is that it was the ***launch of Orladeyo***, and Analysts wanted to see a decent amount of money generated by it. They were expecting Orladeyo sales to top ***$3.1MM*** ***and Orladeyo actually generated*** ***$10.94MM***, this is a ***353% sales beat***

The consequence of the ER beat was an increase of ***24.06%*** in the ***SP***

&#x200B;

It's ***important*** to mention that ***revenues generated this Q1*** only came from the ***USA.***

This ***Q2 Orladeyo*** has been ***approved in Japan/Europe/UK*** aswell, adding new sources of revenue.

***Orladeyo sales*** are expected to ***grow exponentially*** each quarter. Main reason for it is that it has been approved in the countries mentioned above. The other reason is that the amount of ***patients*** they treat will slowly ***score up*** as insurance companies allow their clients to be treated with this drug.

&#x200B;

* **4.1.3 Orladeyo value**

Having in mind the discussed numbers before, Orladeyo alone will be generating ***$2,628,170,000*** a year, using the average mid-cap Biotech company multiplier **x7**. We get a total of ***$18,397,190,000*** meaning an increase of ***$104,46*** in the stock price.

&#x200B;

[Orladeyo value: 104,46$ SP](https://preview.redd.it/9gm01v0ztp171.png?width=1403&format=png&auto=webp&s=fabf3e8b02342dadb174cef96f8428ac44421c7f)

Peramivir (Rapivab) is an antiviral drug for the treatment of influenza. Peramivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor, acting as a transition-state analogue inhibitor of influenza neuraminidase and thereby preventing new viruses from emerging from infected cells. It is approved for intravenous administration.

On 19 December 2014, the FDA approved Peramivir to treat influenza infection in adults. Peramivir has also been approved in Japan and South Korea and is available in Japan as Rapiacta and in South Korea as Peramiflu.

The U.S. government (department of Health and Human Services) gave BioCryst Pharmaceuticals more than $77 million to finish the Phase III clinical development of peramivir. In 2009 the department of Health and Human Services had already given about $180 million to the program.

In 2013 the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA/HHS) released new funding under the current $234.8 million contract to enable completion of a New Drug Application filing for intravenous (IV) peramivir.

&#x200B;

* **4.2.1** **Peramivir value**

With all the explanations given above and having in mind Peramivir is a government bio-defense drug the value of Rapivab can not be less than ***$500,000,000*** conservatively speaking.

&#x200B;

[Peramivir value: $2,84 SP](https://preview.redd.it/gc09kk81up171.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e7fee79582328b95e4db5853fb52c5590dc8b55)

**○ 4.3 Galidesivir - BCX4430**

Galidesivir (BCX4430) is a broad-spectrum antiviral in advanced development for the treatment of viruses that pose a threat to health and national security, including SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of COVID-19), Ebola, Marburg, Yellow Fever and Zika.

The NIAID and BARDA have been funding the development and testing of Galidesivir for over 15 years as they recognize its importance in preparation for all future pandemics. The 31st of August, 2020 NIAID Awarded $44 Million Contract to Advance Development of Galidesivir.

Galidesivir has also demonstrated broad-spectrum activity in vitro against more than 20 ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses in nine different families, including coronaviruses, filoviruses, togaviruses, bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, paramyxoviruses and flaviviruses. (Hepatitis C, West Nile, Dengue, Jap Encephalitis, Yellow Fever, TBEV, OHFV, and Zika), orthomyxoviruses and picornaviruses..

Galidesivir is the first antiviral that has ever shown such potential, and to top it off, it is now known from the Phase I trial and now the Brazil part 1 trial to clearly be safe and show dose-sensitive effects in people. And based on multiple animal studies, it works equally effectively as a pill that is stable for years at room temperature. Not only that, but this antiviral, unlike any of the others, has excellent penetration of the blood brain barrier as was seen in the macaque Zika virus study.

&#x200B;

* **4.3.1 Efficacy**

Galidesivir was safe and generally well tolerated in Phase 1 clinical safety and pharmacokinetics trials by both intravenous and intramuscular routes of administration in healthy subjects. In animal studies, galidesivir has demonstrated survival benefits against a variety of serious pathogens, including Ebola, Marburg, Yellow Fever and Zika viruses.

The company on December 22nd announced that all three doses were perfectly safe for the patients. In addition, they found that patients had a dose-sensitive reduction in virus levels in their lungs. They went on to say that an animal model, showed that Galidesivir significantly reduced COVID-19-associated lung damage.

&#x200B;

* **4.3.2 Galidesivir value**

We must have in mind that Galidesivir is a Government funded bio-defense drug, that aims to treat a wide range of viruses as explained before. Its global stockpiling for future pandemics is also an absolute certainty given its long-term stability. With all the given explanations, conservatively talking Galidesivir can not be worth less than ***$1B this is 5,67$***.

&#x200B;

[Galidesivir value: 5,67$ SP](https://preview.redd.it/cylw2s73up171.png?width=1014&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ea63ebda1f07ddc72762ad137ec92ac17bb87f7)

&#x200B;

**○ 4.4 FOP - BCX9250**

FOP is an ultra-rare, severely disabling condition characterized by the irregular formation of bone outside the normal skeleton, also known as heterotopic ossification (HO). HO can occur in muscles, tendons and soft tissue. Patients with FOP become bound by this irregular ossification over time, with restricted movement and fused joints, resulting in deformities and premature mortality. There are currently no approved treatments for FOP.

There are an estimated 3,500 to 9,000 patients worldwide, with 900 diagnosed so far. Currently there aren’t any approved treatments.

Market size for this treatment is estimated to reach 500M-900M in 2025, growing to 3B in 2028 as more patients are diagnosed. With a price ranging from $900K-$1M/year.

Last December the 21st Biocryst announced positive Phase 1 results

“BCX9250 was safe and well tolerated at all doses studied, with linear and dose-proportional exposure supporting once-daily dosing.”.

“In preclinical studies, BCX9250 demonstrated potency for the target kinase, selectivity, safety and strong suppression of HO in animal models.”

&#x200B;

* **4.4.1 BCX9250 Value**

BCX9250 study will most likely take 4 years to finish, this is, until 2025. By then the potential market we will be aimming for, will be $750,000,000 aprox.

Drugs that are in Phase 1 studies are said to have a 10% chance of making it to the market. Following that, BCX9250 as of now shuld be valued at ***$75,000,000 = 0.43$***

&#x200B;

**○ 4.5 Oral Factor D inhibitor - BCX9930**

&#x200B;

BCX9930 is a novel, ***oral***, potent and selective small molecule ***inhibitor of Factor D*** which recently completed Phase 1 clinical development for the treatment of complement-mediated diseases.

The 3rd of August 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted ***Fast Track designation*** for oral Factor D inhibitor, BCX9930.

***This is how Bill Sheridan*** ( *Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President )* defined [BCX9930 in the last conference call ( 22:00 )](https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/mqqo89/bcrx_biocryst_apr_14_2021_at_845_am_edt_20th/)

***""BCX9930 is a really terrifically exciting project, this is a potent specific Factor D inhibitor. So, the mechanism of action is to block the enzymatic activity of that complement enzyme, that enzyme sits at the very start of the alternative pathway of complement. So, that opens up a whole set of opportunities across diferent diseases that are driven by dysregulation of that alternative pathway of complement and the amplification loop that's embedded in that pathway""***

&#x200B;

* **4.5.1** **Staff excitement**

Staff team from Biocryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc seem to be really positive and ***excited*** about the incoming ***future of BCX9930***. Such excitement has been seen in the last conference calls where staff members such as the CEO Jon P.Stonehouse, or the Vice President, William P.Sheridan would say the ***following words.***

&#x200B;

***“Embarrassment of riches”***

***“We agree with Alexion that creating a potent specific and great oral Factor D inhibitor is a great challenge, and we are happy we have one”***

***“My only concern is i have no concerns”***

***“Pipeline in a molecule”***

***“My aim is to make c5 inhibitors obsolete”***

***“This is Big”***

""***BCX9930 is a really terrifically exciting project""***

&#x200B;

* **4.5.2** **Phase I study**

On March 22, 2021 BCRX announced that ***BCX9930 will be advancing from Ph1 to*** ***Pivotal*** ***Trials in PNH*** ***following the successful proof of concept trial.***

The company announced that a ***Pivotal trial for PNH***, and ***proof of concept trials*** in renal complement-mediated diseases are expected to begin in ***2H 2021.***

On March 22, the company unveiled BCX9930 ***Ph1 data***. The most relevant information from that Ph1 is mentioned below.

""***100%*** of treatment-naïve patients and **83%** of C5 inhibitor inadequate response patients were ***transfusion-free***. *Prior to the trial*, 22 percent of treatment-naïve patients and 17 percent of C5 inadequate responders were transfusion-free ""

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ybrsazv9up171.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=71a0ca39992d0ced02c0f723601e3fd784b92dd4

"" ***Hemoglobin levels increased*** by a mean of ***3.5 g/dL*** in treatment-naïve patients and ***3.2 g/dL*** in C5 inhibitor inadequate response patients; at last visit, mean hemoglobin levels were 11.8 g/dL and 12.2 g/dL, respectively ""

To understand properly how ***positive BCX9930 data was***, below you can find a photo that gathers the data from the main studies done in this kind of inhibitors. What mainly should catch your attention is the ***Hemoglobin change from baseline and the % of transfusion units reduction from baseline*** \- This data has been gathered by ***Barclays***.

&#x200B;

* **4.5.3  BCX9930 Study Primary End point change agreement with the FDA**

Recently the FDA changed the ***primary end-point*** of the BCX9930 study, for it to be the ***change of Hemoglobin level from baseline***. The ***secondary end-point would be the % transfusion free rate reduction.***

This news ***greatly benefit BCX9930's study*** considering how it has ***showed the strongest results in those 2 mentioned study end-points.***

&#x200B;

* **4.5.4 Alternative Pathway**

What makes BCX9930 a game changer, is the wide spectrum of Alternative Pathway Dysregulation disease it can treat. It can treat up to[ 8 diseases](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 26) as of now, that's why insiders call it ***“Pipeline in a molecule”***. Those ***8 diseases*** are shown in the pic below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/voe1863eup171.png?width=1273&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d8a29deed5089d09d8d6669e8b847894d74c786

1- PNH (Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria)

2 - aHUS (Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome)

3 - ANCA vasculitis (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis)

4 - Lupus Nephritis

5 - IgAN vasculitis

6 - C3G (Glomerulonephritis)

7 - PMN (Primary membranous nephropathy)

8 - IgAN (IgA nephropathy)

&#x200B;

* **4.5.5 Potential market size by 2025**

Assuming BCX9930 will be approved by 2025, and it will be able to treat the previously mentioned 8 diseases, we reach to the following conclusion. The potential ***market size BCX9930*** will be aiming for by 2025 scores up to ***$28,56B - $51B / year.*** This numbers are explained below, stating the yearly market size each of those 8 diseases aim for.

&#x200B;

1 - 2 "" Due to COVID-19, the market for ***PNH and aHUS*** was anticipated to grow from US$ 4855 million in 2020 to US$ ***7023 million*** by 2026; it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.89% during 2021–2026.""

3 - “ ***Anca vasculitis*** prevalence in the USA rounds 10-20 per million = 3300-6600 patients. As a treatment example we use Soliris, which costs $500,000/year. We would aim for ***1,65B - 3.3B*** market size as of now. Expected to grow by 2025""

4 - “"" The global systemic ***lupus erythematosus*** market size is expected to reach ***USD 3.08 billion*** by 2025, according to a new report by Grand View Research, Inc., exhibiting a CAGR of 7.0% during the forecast period. ""

5 - 8 “""***IgAN.*** The gathered disease prevalence data varies according to in which coutry the study has been undergone. Data gathered from the undergone study in East Asia, show the prevalence rounds 45 / million. meaning 14,850 patients, or a potential ***7,25B*** market size using Soliris's yearly price ""

6 - ""***C3G:*** Prevalence in the USA round 14-140 per 1M people = 4620-46,200 patients. If those patients were to be treated with Soliris which costs $500,000 / year, the potential market size we aim for rounds ***2,31B - 23,1B*** ""

7 - "" ***PMN*** prevalence is similar to the one of IgAN, so we would potentially aim for a similar market size, meaning ***7.25B***""

&#x200B;

* **4.5.6 Alexion buy out**

On December the 12th, 2020 ***Alexion announced that AstraZeneca was going to buy them out for 39B***. More than ***90% of their revenue come from their “""""Factor D""""” C5 inhibitor,*** being that the main reason why AstraZeneca wanted that buy out to happen.

You might think, why does this matter? Well, remember we have a Factor D which has shown to be more effective than Alexion’s, and is able to treat more diseases than they do aswell. This buy out reflects how ***undervalued BCX9930 is.***

Apart from the buy out, I think it's essential to mention that ***Alexion bought Achillion's ""Factor D"" when it was in Ph2 for $930MM.***

In ***2019*** Alexion's SOLIRIS® (eculizumab) net product sales were ***$3,946.4 million***. Soliris is currently approved to treat ***PNH and aHUS***. Have in mind BCX9930 is able to treat 8 diseases, aiming for a wider market, while having greater efficacy/safety profile.

As a quick ***example***, using the average biotech mid-cap ***x7*** revenue multiplier, and the revenue ***Soliris*** managed to generate in 2019, ***3,964B = 27,748B***. It would mean a ***SP value of $157.56*** for ***BCRX***. I want to make clear again that BCX9930 is said to be best in-class treatment and it's able to treat more diseases, therefore aims for a bigger revenue opportunity.

&#x200B;

* **4.5.7 Soliris/Ultomoris patients survey**

BCRX recently did a ***survey with 23 patients***, 12 of them using ***Ultomiris*** and the other 11 ***Soliris.*** The survey showed that ***91% of the patients were interested in switching*** due to the reasons explained in the pic below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6wsb9hchup171.png?width=1448&format=png&auto=webp&s=d92b1a169e593a7ac3152237092e3efd8468ee70

Some of the ***patients treated with BCX9930*** were asked some questions, among them, the ***6th*** one expressed his ***desire to be able to be treated with BCX9930 oral pill.*** As we have seen it before with Orladeyo, patients are ***highly willing to switch from needles to oral-pill*** form treatments.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* **4.5.8 BCX9930 From a Ph1 to a Ph3**

&#x200B;

On March 22, 2021 BCX9930 PNH Ph1 data was shown, the obtained ***results were so good that it enabled BCX9930 jump from a*** ***Ph1 to a pivotal Ph3 trial in PNH***\*\*\*, totally skipping the Ph2.\*\*\*

Additional ***proof of concept BCX9930*** ***Ph2 trials in Renal Complement-Mediated diseases*** will be made.

Straight ***jumping from a*** ***ph1 to a pivotal ph3*** trial, is something that's ***not common in the bio world*** and could be taken as a really ***bullish sign***. Apart from it being a bullish sign, it ***accelerates the process of development of the drug***, giving it a chance to ***hit the market in a smaller span of ti***

&#x200B;

* **4.5.9** **BCX9930 valuation**

Having in mind BCX9930 is a ***potential*** ***best-in-class treatment***, that Alexion got bought out for 39B mainly for their “Factor D” c5 inhibitor, and the yearly market size BCX9930 aims for in 2025 rounds the $28,56B - $51B mark. BCX9930 valuation can not be less than a ***30% of Alexion’s buy out price***, this is ***11.7B meaning 66.44$.***

&#x200B;

[BCX9930 value: 66.44$ SP](https://preview.redd.it/phh7inljup171.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2994d05aec97ea91d0e085ed352ce68ce2c217c)

&#x200B;

* **5. Strong BO Buy Out candidate**

As we have explained in the Institutional section before, all good bio-tech investors do know who Alexander ***J.Denner founder of Sarissa Capital*** is. After recently ***increasing his stake in BCRX***, along with BlackRock, he now ***owns a 5%*** of Biocryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Denner, has increased his position in BCRX by an stunning ***789% in the last 3 quarters***, showing ***strong conviction*** in the company.

Since Denner opened his position in Alexion, it took him 5 months to close the buy out deal, as shown in the picture below

📷

https://preview.redd.it/of897ahmup171.png?width=1300&format=png&auto=webp&s=abc2123461c38ce6d62c8320916416b87267db02

After this exhaustive analysis on the company, we can easily acknowledge that BCRX is more than a ***strong BO candidate***. A buy out coming from ***BIIB***, company ***where Denner forms part of the BOD board of directors,*** would make total sense ***in the following 2 years*** once BCX9930 Factor D phase III data is unveiled.

It also is important to mention that ***Bank of America added BCRX to the list of top M&A candidates ( Mergers and Acquisitions )*** as of October 30th, 2020. Stating how they believe BCRX will have a ***strong revenue growth in the incoming years.***

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* **6. Alexion's performance with Soliris**

As we have explained before, Alexion Pharmaceuticals has its own """"""""Factor D"""""""" C5 inhibitor inhibitor called Soliris.

Alexion could be the perfect example to have an idea of what we could expect from Biocryst's in the incoming years. ***From 2007 to 2014 Alexion's stock price grew a 1777%***. Being valued at ***10.5$ in 2007 and 186.6$ in 2014.***

Revenue generated by Alexion gradually grew up as their Factor D was approved to treat additional diseases, and the market size it captured became wider.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6ix67squup171.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4bf5e078a9461e9e4c067833d7af2f9d802da8f

Biocryst Pharmaceuticals managing to do the SP move Alexion did, is more than ***doable*** with the unique pipeline it possess. Having in mind ***Alexion made 66.4 MM revenue the first year while BCRX expects to generate 500 MM plus with Orladeyo,*** apart from it, additional revenue generated by ***Rapivab/Galidesivir stockpillings*** may come. Incoming Earning Reports are meant to be potential catalysts for the company, gradually becoming more meaningful as the market size they capture with Orladeyo becomes wider.

&#x200B;

* **7.** **De-risked company**

Last December the 7th, 2020 BCRX announced they made a Royalty ***agreement with Royalty Pharma and Athyrium Capital Management.*** With this agreement BCRX was funded with ***$325,000,000 in order to support Orladeyo launch***. Setting the company in an attractive position of ***not needing to do any money rising ""Offering"".***

***Jon Stonehouse CEO***, also confirmed that the company will ***not need to do offerings anymore.*** The fact that the company is already generating revenue with Orladeyo is another strong evidence that confirms money risings will not be needed anymore.

It's important to restate that as part of the Royalty agreement, ***Royalty Pharma will receive a 1% on global net sales of BCX9930, if approved.*** Showing how ***bullish they are on BCX9930*** and their willingness to invest at it.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gezetorvup171.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6880f64de595b224faf806b09f22385ba88dabf

&#x200B;

* **8. Forward looking statements**

&#x200B;

1. From now on ***EarningReports should be catalysts and positive for the company,*** obtaining better results each quarter as the company settles down and receives additional approvals for Orladeyo in different countries.
2. Orladeyo ***European launch.***
3. The company will have to provide some colour on the ***BCX9930 PNH pivotal trial***, how it will be planned etc etc... Aswell as the ***PH2 trials*** in complement-mediated diseases.
4. ***BCX9250 Next steps*** should soon be shared by the company
5. ***BCX4430 Galidesivir*** recently completed a Ph1, additional information about the study may be given. It's important to mention that this study was fully funded by the NIAID.
6. ***Galidesivir/Rapivab stockpilling.***

&#x200B;

*From now on revenues/BCX9930 updates are the main catalysts.*

&#x200B;

* **9. Conclusion**

After this exhaustive analysis, we come to the conclusion that ***BCRX is severely undervalued***, and if we sum up the true value of the pipeline, it should be valued around ***180$***. The StockPrice fair value number will keep growing as we keep getting data updates from the on-going studies and Orladeyo revenues keep growing, making it an ***excellent long-term hold and buy out candidate.***

I currently do have a position in this company, my average entry price being around the 4$ range. My initial plan is to hold the shares for the long term, at least 2 years more provided that we don't get bought out earlier. I expect the StockPrice to keep rising as Orladeyo revenues flow in and BCX9930 trials keep progressing, aswell as the rest of the pipeline.",nmfr14,BCRX DD - The Embarrassment of Riches

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote...

and balking at even a penny of additional liquidity. How the Fed will continue to monetize debt then, when the repo system is now out of collateral, is anyone's guess.

By mid-July, we’ll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase higher yields in the FX swap market amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative

Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks.

Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho.

Ngl this seems like a prettt solid play rn low volume and it’s just been on the slow and steady rise 

This is a real game-changing technology which can offer a real alternative with an interchangeable battery technology for the existing lithium-ion batteries in almost every application with GMG’s Graphene and UQ’s patent-pending aluminum ion battery technology. The current nominal voltage of our batteries is 1.7 volts, and work is being carried out to increase the voltage to directly replace existing batteries and which lead to higher energy densities.

The real differentiator about these batteries is their very high power density of up to 7000 watts/kg, which endows them with a very high charge rate. Furthermore, graphene aluminum-ion batteries provide major benefits in terms of longer battery life (over 2000 charge / discharge cycles testing so far with no deterioration in performance), battery safety (very low fire potential) and lower environmental impact (more recyclable).

graph looks good. good buy. but if u want idk. not a professional buy at ur own risk. yeah.🚀.

Okay! Breakfast came early for You GMG.V Bulls. Its Pencil lead, not crayons today though, although Im hoping that someone with Market DD will post here in a bit and make us some fresh hot crayons. this is my first time on here doing anything like this, so go easy on me:

So here's some stuff I was able to get:

The only person with a science background That I can really find is their CSO:

Ashock Kumar Nanjundan CSO:

Pukyong National University

Degree Name: Doctor of Engineering

Materials Science

Current Adjunct professor at Queensland University (Gotta Do Something for the Kids Right)

Publications:

I’ll Let you guys go to sci hub to download this review for yourself, But the TLDR is that this dude knows his shit on how to dope graphene to get it to work as a battery.

Cited by: 178, For less academic Apes this means that 178 other scientists were like “yeah this dude knows his shit, Imma cite what he’s saying ~basically~ as fact.

https://doi.org/10.1039/C6EE00158K

Ashock’s most cited individual work comes from his first post-doc that he completed in Korea.

Polyaniline-Grafted Reduced Graphene Oxide for Efficient Electrochemical Supercapacitors.

Basically he does some pretty no-brainer synthesys to link graphene and another semi-conducting polymer that really enhances the graphene properties (Pretty nobrainer basic polymer bro shit, even so, it look like he probably wrote good supporting info and saved a lot of people a lot of time).

https://doi.org/10.1021/nn204688c

Total citations for all work combined: 3,845

This is pretty damn good for someone so young.

Here is a research paper that I'm having trouble accessing that seems to be relevant to this company's work on aluminum-graphene based batteries. If anyone can find it, DM me!

https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202010569

All in all, based on what I can see from linkedin about this company, they have a great CSO. He does seem to be both teaching and doing research in academia. He was recently brought up from a “Head Product Scientist” role to a CSO role, so hopefully this change will reflect a move away from more general research and towards really developing this stuff for GMG.V

I’m concerned about product development at this company, specifically it's unclear who is managing it. I’m not able to see every employee linkedin, but it may be that one of the people not visible is leading product development. You might be thinking ~but wait~ what if there is a group of slave PHD students/postdocs at the university of Queensland working on this stuff?  Yes there is. Nanjundan has some connections with the YU group (https://aibn.uq.edu.au/yu.)) And then here is a press release about it. (https://graphenemg.com/gmg-the-university-of-queensland-research-uni-quest-kick-off-the-graphene-enhanced-aluminium-ion-battery-development-project/)

It sounds like the company has recently had some really good results in R&D, but until I can see and Audit the product/process development lead, ill probably avoid going all in $$.

~sometimes~ the COO role at these companies can be a technical role that helps with process development, but the COO looks to be doing mostly operations type stuff and is non-technical. Not wholly worrisome, but I do want to see  more listed employees on linkedin and then someone that is leading doing process development/scale up and quality control… quality assurance wouldn't hurt either.

It also looks like this company is casting a wide net of potential products, but it's entirely unclear if it has launched any of them. Hopefully it does. It feels uncommon these days for a company to go the IPO route so early on in R&D, most will look to do venture capital funding first to launch a few products. Is this an australian thing? Or is this just crowdfunding with extra steps? If you have more info, lets talk

I'm a materials science ape and don't know anything about Stock Market DD, but why not rely on science DD to decide on investments?

SNDL is the cannabis company on the world with the most cash on hand, that means there will be a lot of news about acquisitions coming, because SNDL by being the cannabis company with the most cash on hand, is the cannabis company on the world with the most opportunities to make acquisitions. 

And I think those acquisitions are going to be cannabis companies from the United States, for the reasons that in the United States the cannabis companies are not worth much because they are not on NASDAQ and the United States is going to be the largest cannabis market on the world.",nmibbb,I think that SNDL is going to be worth $20 dollars per share this year

5954,,2021-05-27 21:46:21,t3_nmii4i,,wallstreetbets,"Somebody tell me if this would work. I buy stocks using covered calls.  I bought ROKU at $330 and sold the July 355 Call. I can go uncovered and sell the stock but I'd rather not as that jumps into margin.  ROKU will likely be weak over the next few weeks and I'd like to book the $16 profit. So what I'm thinking:

Sell July $300 call (deep in the money with a theta close to 1) at $47 which means I'll sell the stock at $347 when I'm called out

Simultaneously buy the July $330 call which is where I got into the stock. That July call covers the open short call I already have when the stock gets called at $300.  

&#x200B;

What am I missing here? Am I out the option price for the $330 call in which case I should just go uncovered and try and pick up ROKU cheaper and hope it doesn't run?  I can't figure the math on this and if it would work.  If there is another strategy for booking profit on the underlying  of a covered call I'd like to know.",nmii4i,Option question - booking profit on a covered call

And shorts surprisingly have not covered. Yesterday, amc had 90 million short volume and si actually went up the past few days. Amc had went up 20% and shorters lost over $700 million that day alone. 

Now today amc runs up to 36%? Shorters are fuk, and they fucking dumb too",,

Stop for a moment and think: what are my life goals? Why did I enter this trade? What do I want to get out of it? What can I do with the profit I'm looking at right now? If I was looking at this for the first time, with $0 in, would I enter now at these prices?

Take it from me, I left $100k+ of GME profit on the table and watched it all burn because I lost sight of the bigger picture. What do you think will feel worse: Missing out on a few % more gains, or watching it crash and being left with 90% less than what you could take now. Do you want to be able to tell a story about how you got 10x, 20x, 100x gains, or a sad sack story about how you ""could have"" had whatever you have now, but blew it and missed out.

You can't call the top, if you try to achieve some magical beautiful exit where you sell everything exactly at the top, you will get burned.

Tilray's stock should continue to rise and the eight-day EMA will cross back above the 21-day EMA, which would be very bullish.

Tilray's relative strength index is registering at about 50%, which is very comfortable for the bulls because it has a lot of room to move higher before going into overbought territory.

Bulls want to see the eight-day EMA cross above the 21-day EMA as they continue to push Tilray's stock over resistance near the $17 mark. If the stock can regain that level, it has room to move up toward the $20 level.",,

A put is just a contract stating the seller will purchase from the holder of the contract, 100 shares at the strike price. It’s useful to buy one when you are worried an investment of shares you have might go down in value (below the strike). If it does you get to sell your shares for the strike. If not, you bought peace of mind for the premium. 

The seller of the put has to put up collateral to buy the shares (so 100 * strike price). And they get paid a premium. If the stock goes below they start losing money. If the stock doesn’t go below strike, they got free premium. 

From my experiences gambling around this place, puts blow unless you’re learning theta gang techniques. Or selling them on high IV to get really high premiums (just make sure you like the stock).",,

Only one doctor in the room agreed with the mom. But the biggest determining factor is if the dad had it done to themselves when they were born.  In the   50s 60s and maybe 70s, many places didn’t even ask, they just immediately did it. That’s when it was happening all over the world, so many people having kids in the 80s and 90s had it done to them without choice from the parents and now they’re having kids of their own.

>Since late November 2020, 85,918,776 total shares of the company have been sold short in the U.S., according to the Buyins.net report.
That means an average of 57.16% of the company’s shares traded every day in the U.S. look like they have been sold short.
In Canada, the numbers seem even larger. The report shows that a shocking 113,188,174 shares of the company have been sold short since May 24, 2016 (inferred from US short selling average in RECAF). That number tells an even more surprising story in combination with the charts below that we think expose the truth: the majority of this short position may have started in the middle of 2020.
And with ReconAfrica expected to announce results from Well 2 within the next 4 weeks and if those results are good, which the company’s management seems very confident about, then Short sellers may not have a long time to get out of their huge position.",,

 = = = = 

so hell - heres a **different** subject : 

Here's a game to play when you're bored.. toss a coin once.. it will land either Heads or Tails = 50:50 chance .. easy, right? .. We know that. 

Now toss it ten times - on AVERAGE ten tosses will give you 5 heads, 5 tails. Right?  
So will you put your money down and bet you get 5 and 5  just throwing the coin ten times only. (not 4 and 6 - not 3 and 7.. just 5:5 to win)

Should be 50:50  chance that you get 5 of each

.. er .. right?

 this has nothing to do with stock trading, it's just something to do while you are fuguring out how your mind works (or how anyone's mind works)

Got into this during GME wave one. Made some cash, lost it quick. Rode the second wave of GME and started feeling really good. Thought all I touched turned to gold after nailing the RKT jump too. Made some wrong moves but was still ahead. Dove deep and invested more money and then grew my portfolio from 10k to 14.5k. I know that’s small but as someone who believed it was index funds or nothing it was a high I won’t soon forget. However, after feeling like hot shit and making some bad moves while folding like a little bitch I was down to 2.8k. Don’t ask about my shit moves lol. However, I’m getting back on track and this is my fun money. I’m hoping I’ll be able to change my families financial outcomes majorly in the next 5 years. It’s been a lot of fun, but recently I’ve found myself down a lot with my current account balance, we are now back to 4k though. So all that to say, just remember you may find the right move, you may find 5. But there are many moves that will crush you. Be smart, be safe, don’t invest what you’re not willing to lose. 

And most importantly remember your family, friends, and people around you matter a lot, and you matter a lot to them.

Oh! And most importantly…

8181,,2021-05-27 18:06:29,t3_nmdjep,,wallstreetbets,"Clearly, the company Shopify {SHOP} is in a market that is growing as it was showing before the beginning of the pandemic already -when the stock rose up to $500. I mean who doesn't believe in the internet here :-\]

During the pandemic, this SOFTWARE company helped a lot of smaller and midsize businesses as they were easily able to set up an e-commerce presence with Shopify's help. As a result, SHOP revenue increased a lot and the stock got propelled up to a crazy over 200 times forward earnings and a still to high current $$ 1240 price tag today. Yeah, that is my opinion only but Note: At the last press conference they said that operating cost will increase \[and by revenue increase will slow down\], THEY SAID IT - but nobody wants to hear it. 

You may wonder why to believe me if everybody can see that the stock price didn't fall back to a quite logic 60 times earnings \[like FANG Stocks for example\] ... meaning about 7-800 Dollars ...  

Well, SHOP was falling but then ...   
I can only assume that the three leaving executives teamed up with some other people who are interested in bumping the stock up again. Together they started an extensive press campaign, the one that we see even today: ""Shopify poised to go up"" I read today? Is it not that always when another one of these messages comes out A LOT OF stocks are suddenly traded? And that when the price goes up \[and even down\] it is often a very controlled 40bucks a day?    


IF you still want to read more, let's look up that complete marketing campaign to bring the SHOP stock up again:   
First Shopify was compared with Amazon itself - which is laughable. Even Karl Marx knew already that capitalism tends to create a monopoly. Shopify ... by helping all the little and medium companies with their software is the exact opposite of Amazon. Not to mention that the malls are full again ... meaning fewer people will buy online than during the pandemic. Which at least in the short and midterm will bring online revenues down a bit.

Then Google mentioned some Google button that makes it easier to find Shopify customers. Well yes but that doesn't help Shopify results at all. AND it makes clear that Shopify customers severely lack visibility compared with an omnipotent Amazon.   
   
Then the Shopify payment system was hyped. Buy now pay later? REALLY? The """"have's"""" have credit cards and pay with them as they even get perks/payback and points for it. So who uses the buy now pay later system? The ""DO NOT HAVE's with only a half-decent credit score of course.

Sorry but when I read about this I was only able to imagine the Shopify payment system as a """"buy now pay NEVER"""" system and I certainly had no idea how this helps the Shopify stock in the long run. Do the revenue numbers go up in the quarterly results? What about liabilities? 

Then SHOP was mentioned as the ""stock to have"" in 2021 ?? Not even worth a comment. 

For me, the only thing that is ""poised to happen"" is that the pockets of the three leaving former executives of Shopify are filled and that the buying retail investors are screwed over in about 2 months' time with a two-digit percentage loss. 

And I write all this while I actually like the Shopify story, as I like Tesla and so many things that are happening with all these wonderful tech companies ...  
But IMO the SHOP stock goes back to $800 exactly as Tesla went down from 900\[intraday\] to now 600...

Well, Good luck, give me your thoughts and I hope the bots even allow a huge and way too long posting like this.",nmdjep,My thoughts about all the stories published on SHOP Stock recently

After discussing the value of each drug in the pipeline, we come to the conclusion that ***BCRX s*****hould be** ***valued at $180***. If you are looking for some extensive and detailed DD on the company, this is the article you're looking for, and I highly suggest you keep reading it. In case you find the given information useful, I encourage you to support the article in order to reach more people and rise awareness of how undervalued BCRX is.

Before starting to read the article, my suggestion is to ***focus more on Orladeyo and BCX9930***, since both of them are the ***most valuable assests of the company*** at the moment.

If you want to learn more about the company ***check out***[ ***u/bio9999***](https://www.reddit.com/u/bio9999/) ***and the community***[ ***r/BCRX***](https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/)***,*** some of the informartion related with Galidesivir directly come from bio9999's posts.

&#x200B;

Basically BCRX went up a 10% today because it was mentioned in multiple Reddit/FOMO related articles. Those companies mentioned in the article were referred to as 'memes' , including BCRX.

Well, BCRX ain't a meme at all. In fact it potentially could be the most solid investment in the Bio-world in terms of Risk/Reward. The reasons will be explained in this article.

* **1. About Biocryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.**

Biocryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. BCRX, is a commercial-stage ***drug developer*** headquartered in Durham, North Carolina, that focuses on developing oral therapeutics for ***rare diseases***.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ukxggvumtp171.png?width=352&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fe37bfc930c3f1e95404960b5a8f55b2caea0fe

&#x200B;

* **2. Unique staff team**

The company was founded in 1996 and is currently led by ***Jon P. Stonehouse CEO***, a renowned pharmaceutical executive with over 20 years of thought leadership. Stonehouse previously served as the Senior Vice President of Corporate Development at Merck. Among his numerous accomplishments, Stonehouse was responsible for the game-changing acquisition of Serono S.A in 2007, the largest biotechnology company in Europe at the time.

What makes Jon Stonehouse a ***unique CEO is the*** ***dedication*** ***he has*** ***towards patients*** through his commitment to working faster in order to bring life-saving rare disease therapeutics to patient populations around the world. His passion is further substantiated by the note he had pasted on his monitor during the[ 2021 JPM Healthcare Conference](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/41ee0771-0acc-479e-a39e-2842101c6aa9)

&#x200B;

* **3. Institutional ownership**

Apart from having a stellar management team, what prospective retail investors should also pay close attention to is BioCryst’s rockstar institutional investor syndicate, which includes both generalist industry stalwarts such as ***State Street/BlackRock*** and sector-specialist biotech funds like ***Baker Brothers/Sarissa Capital***.

&#x200B;

**○ 4.1 Orladeyo**™ **(Berotralstat) oral pill**

&#x200B;

Orladeyo is the ***first Oral approved*** treatment used to prevent swelling attacks in people with ***hereditary angioedema (HAE)*****,** disease which is estimated to affect ***1 in 50,000 people***

&#x200B;

\- Orladeyo was firstly approved in the ***USA*** ***December the 3rd,*** ***2020. Q4***

\- Orladeyo received ***Japan*** NHI price listing approval ***April the 14th, 2021. Q2***

\- Orladeyo received ***Europe*** approval ***April the 30th, 2021 Q2***

\- Orladeyo received ***UK*** approval ***May the 12th, 2021 Q2***

&#x200B;

***CEO*** himself Jon Stonehouse ***confirmed*** in the [last conference call, ( 22:15 )](https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/mqqo89/bcrx_biocryst_apr_14_2021_at_845_am_edt_20th/) ***Orladeyo will annually*** be generating ***$500MM plus revenue.***

\-Serge Belanger ( ***Analyst*** ): I think in the past you've talked about ***sales potential for Orladeyo of 500 million plus***, are you still reiterating that target?

\- Stonehouse ( ***CEO*** ): ***Yeah make sure you remember the plus.***

&#x200B;

***Orladeyo*** is [ranked](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/pharmacy/20-most-expensive-prescription-drugs-in-2021.html) the ***#13 most expensive drug*** ***in the USA*** market. ***$37,308*** is approximately what patients must monthly pay to access the drug.

&#x200B;

***Before oral Orladeyo*** was approved for HAE, ***patients*** would only have treatments that required usage of ***needles***. This dramatically ***reduced the*** ***quality of their life***, making some of them quit using the treatment. That's the main ***reason*** why ***Orladeyo is a game changer***.

&#x200B;

As it's shown in[ the January 2021 Corporate Presentation](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 16), Physicians expect to Prescribe ***Orladeyo for over 40% of HAE Patients.***

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v12offyttp171.png?width=1241&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8b373280fbf16a18d895232c4337554ea1d03db

&#x200B;

* **4.1.1** **Pricings/Revenue**

&#x200B;

**USA**

In the USA there currently are 10,000 patients, ***7500 diagnosed and treated,*** 1700 diagnosed but not treated, 600 treated but not diagnosed.

Physicians expect to prescribe Orladeyo for over 41% of HAE patients. Conservatively thinking, taking 7,500 patients ( the diagnosed and treated ones ) out of the total 10,000 pool in the USA, with over[ 41% of patients prescription](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) ( page 16 ) we would conservatively aim for ***3,075 patients.***

The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in the USA, is equal to ***485,000$***

&#x200B;

**Japan**

On November the 5th Biocryst undergone an agreement with ***Torii Pharmaceuticals.*** A local Japanese company that will be in charge of getting new patients to be treated with Orladeyo in Japan and commerzialing it.

Japan has around 2,500 HAE patients, and Biocryst conservatively expects to ***at*** ***least reach 500 patients.***

The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in Japan, is equal to ***$248,500***

***Approval of Orladeyo in Japan issued a $15MM milestone payment*** from Torii.

***BioCryst will receive*** tiered royalties ranging from ***20% - 40% of Japanese sales.***

&#x200B;

**Europe**

It's estimated to be around ***12,000 HAE patients in Europe.*** Following the physician prescription of over[ 41% of patients to prescribe](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 16) for Orladeyo. We get a total of ***4,920 patients*** in Europe.

Since pricings and jurisdictions work in a different way in Europe, the amount of money each patient will have to pay for Orladeyo is expected to be around or above Japan's ***$248,500/year.*** This number should soon be confirmed.

With this yearly prices and the amount of patients defined before, we get the following results.

&#x200B;

\- ***USA - 3,075p x 485K = 1,491,375,000$***

\- ***Japan - 500p x 248,5K = 124,250,000$***

\- ***EU - 4,920p x 248,5K = 1,222,620,000$***

&#x200B;

Summing it all up we get $2,751,270,000. From that number we have to subtract 123,100,000$ making it a total of ***$2,628,170,000***. The sustraction happens as a result of the undergone Royalty agreement with Torii Pharmaceuticals and Royalty Pharma.

&#x200B;

* **4.1.2 Q1 EarningsReport Beat**

&#x200B;

On May the 6th, 2021 BCRX presented Q1 Earnings Report data which managed to ***Beat Analysts estimates***. Basically what matters from this ***Q1 ER*** is that it was the ***launch of Orladeyo***, and Analysts wanted to see a decent amount of money generated by it. They were expecting Orladeyo sales to top ***$3.1MM*** ***and Orladeyo actually generated*** ***$10.94MM***, this is a ***353% sales beat***

The consequence of the ER beat was an increase of ***24.06%*** in the ***SP***

&#x200B;

It's ***important*** to mention that ***revenues generated this Q1*** only came from the ***USA.***

This ***Q2 Orladeyo*** has been ***approved in Japan/Europe/UK*** aswell, adding new sources of revenue.

***Orladeyo sales*** are expected to ***grow exponentially*** each quarter. Main reason for it is that it has been approved in the countries mentioned above. The other reason is that the amount of ***patients*** they treat will slowly ***score up*** as insurance companies allow their clients to be treated with this drug.

&#x200B;

* **4.1.3 Orladeyo value**

Having in mind the discussed numbers before, Orladeyo alone will be generating ***$2,628,170,000*** a year, using the average mid-cap Biotech company multiplier **x7**. We get a total of ***$18,397,190,000*** meaning an increase of ***$104,46*** in the stock price.

&#x200B;

[Orladeyo value: 104,46$ SP](https://preview.redd.it/9gm01v0ztp171.png?width=1403&format=png&auto=webp&s=fabf3e8b02342dadb174cef96f8428ac44421c7f)

**○ 4.2 Peramivir** ™ **(Rapivab)**

Peramivir (Rapivab) is an antiviral drug for the treatment of influenza. Peramivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor, acting as a transition-state analogue inhibitor of influenza neuraminidase and thereby preventing new viruses from emerging from infected cells. It is approved for intravenous administration.

On 19 December 2014, the FDA approved Peramivir to treat influenza infection in adults. Peramivir has also been approved in Japan and South Korea and is available in Japan as Rapiacta and in South Korea as Peramiflu.

The U.S. government (department of Health and Human Services) gave BioCryst Pharmaceuticals more than $77 million to finish the Phase III clinical development of peramivir. In 2009 the department of Health and Human Services had already given about $180 million to the program.

In 2013 the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA/HHS) released new funding under the current $234.8 million contract to enable completion of a New Drug Application filing for intravenous (IV) peramivir.

&#x200B;

* **4.2.1** **Peramivir value**

With all the explanations given above and having in mind Peramivir is a government bio-defense drug the value of Rapivab can not be less than ***$500,000,000*** conservatively speaking.

&#x200B;

[Peramivir value: $2,84 SP](https://preview.redd.it/gc09kk81up171.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e7fee79582328b95e4db5853fb52c5590dc8b55)

**○ 4.3 Galidesivir - BCX4430**

Galidesivir (BCX4430) is a broad-spectrum antiviral in advanced development for the treatment of viruses that pose a threat to health and national security, including SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of COVID-19), Ebola, Marburg, Yellow Fever and Zika.

The NIAID and BARDA have been funding the development and testing of Galidesivir for over 15 years as they recognize its importance in preparation for all future pandemics. The 31st of August, 2020 NIAID Awarded $44 Million Contract to Advance Development of Galidesivir.

Galidesivir has also demonstrated broad-spectrum activity in vitro against more than 20 ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses in nine different families, including coronaviruses, filoviruses, togaviruses, bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, paramyxoviruses and flaviviruses. (Hepatitis C, West Nile, Dengue, Jap Encephalitis, Yellow Fever, TBEV, OHFV, and Zika), orthomyxoviruses and picornaviruses..

Galidesivir is the first antiviral that has ever shown such potential, and to top it off, it is now known from the Phase I trial and now the Brazil part 1 trial to clearly be safe and show dose-sensitive effects in people. And based on multiple animal studies, it works equally effectively as a pill that is stable for years at room temperature. Not only that, but this antiviral, unlike any of the others, has excellent penetration of the blood brain barrier as was seen in the macaque Zika virus study.

&#x200B;

* **4.3.1 Efficacy**

Galidesivir was safe and generally well tolerated in Phase 1 clinical safety and pharmacokinetics trials by both intravenous and intramuscular routes of administration in healthy subjects. In animal studies, galidesivir has demonstrated survival benefits against a variety of serious pathogens, including Ebola, Marburg, Yellow Fever and Zika viruses.

The company on December 22nd announced that all three doses were perfectly safe for the patients. In addition, they found that patients had a dose-sensitive reduction in virus levels in their lungs. They went on to say that an animal model, showed that Galidesivir significantly reduced COVID-19-associated lung damage.

&#x200B;

* **4.3.2 Galidesivir value**

We must have in mind that Galidesivir is a Government funded bio-defense drug, that aims to treat a wide range of viruses as explained before. Its global stockpiling for future pandemics is also an absolute certainty given its long-term stability. With all the given explanations, conservatively talking Galidesivir can not be worth less than ***$1B this is 5,67$***.

&#x200B;

[Galidesivir value: 5,67$ SP](https://preview.redd.it/cylw2s73up171.png?width=1014&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ea63ebda1f07ddc72762ad137ec92ac17bb87f7)

&#x200B;

**○ 4.4 FOP - BCX9250**

FOP is an ultra-rare, severely disabling condition characterized by the irregular formation of bone outside the normal skeleton, also known as heterotopic ossification (HO). HO can occur in muscles, tendons and soft tissue. Patients with FOP become bound by this irregular ossification over time, with restricted movement and fused joints, resulting in deformities and premature mortality. There are currently no approved treatments for FOP.

There are an estimated 3,500 to 9,000 patients worldwide, with 900 diagnosed so far. Currently there aren’t any approved treatments.

Market size for this treatment is estimated to reach 500M-900M in 2025, growing to 3B in 2028 as more patients are diagnosed. With a price ranging from $900K-$1M/year.

Last December the 21st Biocryst announced positive Phase 1 results

“BCX9250 was safe and well tolerated at all doses studied, with linear and dose-proportional exposure supporting once-daily dosing.”.

“In preclinical studies, BCX9250 demonstrated potency for the target kinase, selectivity, safety and strong suppression of HO in animal models.”

&#x200B;

* **4.4.1 BCX9250 Value**

BCX9250 study will most likely take 4 years to finish, this is, until 2025. By then the potential market we will be aimming for, will be $750,000,000 aprox.

Drugs that are in Phase 1 studies are said to have a 10% chance of making it to the market. Following that, BCX9250 as of now shuld be valued at ***$75,000,000 = 0.43$***

&#x200B;

[BCX9250 value: 0.43$ SP](https://preview.redd.it/2pzut0l5up171.png?width=1256&format=png&auto=webp&s=b15d1398adb586ec78c8ba83f5ec3485d2bcc099)

**○ 4.5 Oral Factor D inhibitor - BCX9930**

&#x200B;

BCX9930 is a novel, ***oral***, potent and selective small molecule ***inhibitor of Factor D*** which recently completed Phase 1 clinical development for the treatment of complement-mediated diseases.

The 3rd of August 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted ***Fast Track designation*** for oral Factor D inhibitor, BCX9930.

***This is how Bill Sheridan*** ( *Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President )* defined [BCX9930 in the last conference call ( 22:00 )](https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/mqqo89/bcrx_biocryst_apr_14_2021_at_845_am_edt_20th/)

***""BCX9930 is a really terrifically exciting project, this is a potent specific Factor D inhibitor. So, the mechanism of action is to block the enzymatic activity of that complement enzyme, that enzyme sits at the very start of the alternative pathway of complement. So, that opens up a whole set of opportunities across diferent diseases that are driven by dysregulation of that alternative pathway of complement and the amplification loop that's embedded in that pathway""***

&#x200B;

* **4.5.1** **Staff excitement**

Staff team from Biocryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc seem to be really positive and ***excited*** about the incoming ***future of BCX9930***. Such excitement has been seen in the last conference calls where staff members such as the CEO Jon P.Stonehouse, or the Vice President, William P.Sheridan would say the ***following words.***

&#x200B;

***“Embarrassment of riches”***

***“We agree with Alexion that creating a potent specific and great oral Factor D inhibitor is a great challenge, and we are happy we have one”***

***“My only concern is i have no concerns”***

***“Pipeline in a molecule”***

***“My aim is to make c5 inhibitors obsolete”***

***“This is Big”***

""***BCX9930 is a really terrifically exciting project""***

&#x200B;

* **4.5.2** **Phase I study**

On March 22, 2021 BCRX announced that ***BCX9930 will be advancing from Ph1 to*** ***Pivotal*** ***Trials in PNH*** ***following the successful proof of concept trial.***

The company announced that a ***Pivotal trial for PNH***, and ***proof of concept trials*** in renal complement-mediated diseases are expected to begin in ***2H 2021.***

On March 22, the company unveiled BCX9930 ***Ph1 data***. The most relevant information from that Ph1 is mentioned below.

""***100%*** of treatment-naïve patients and **83%** of C5 inhibitor inadequate response patients were ***transfusion-free***. *Prior to the trial*, 22 percent of treatment-naïve patients and 17 percent of C5 inadequate responders were transfusion-free ""

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ybrsazv9up171.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=71a0ca39992d0ced02c0f723601e3fd784b92dd4

"" ***Hemoglobin levels increased*** by a mean of ***3.5 g/dL*** in treatment-naïve patients and ***3.2 g/dL*** in C5 inhibitor inadequate response patients; at last visit, mean hemoglobin levels were 11.8 g/dL and 12.2 g/dL, respectively ""

To understand properly how ***positive BCX9930 data was***, below you can find a photo that gathers the data from the main studies done in this kind of inhibitors. What mainly should catch your attention is the ***Hemoglobin change from baseline and the % of transfusion units reduction from baseline*** \- This data has been gathered by ***Barclays***.

&#x200B;

* **4.5.3  BCX9930 Study Primary End point change agreement with the FDA**

Recently the FDA changed the ***primary end-point*** of the BCX9930 study, for it to be the ***change of Hemoglobin level from baseline***. The ***secondary end-point would be the % transfusion free rate reduction.***

This news ***greatly benefit BCX9930's study*** considering how it has ***showed the strongest results in those 2 mentioned study end-points.***

&#x200B;

* **4.5.4 Alternative Pathway**

What makes BCX9930 a game changer, is the wide spectrum of Alternative Pathway Dysregulation disease it can treat. It can treat up to[ 8 diseases](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 26) as of now, that's why insiders call it ***“Pipeline in a molecule”***. Those ***8 diseases*** are shown in the pic below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/voe1863eup171.png?width=1273&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d8a29deed5089d09d8d6669e8b847894d74c786

1- PNH (Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria)

2 - aHUS (Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome)

3 - ANCA vasculitis (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis)

4 - Lupus Nephritis

5 - IgAN vasculitis

6 - C3G (Glomerulonephritis)

7 - PMN (Primary membranous nephropathy)

8 - IgAN (IgA nephropathy)

&#x200B;

* **4.5.5 Potential market size by 2025**

Assuming BCX9930 will be approved by 2025, and it will be able to treat the previously mentioned 8 diseases, we reach to the following conclusion. The potential ***market size BCX9930*** will be aiming for by 2025 scores up to ***$28,56B - $51B / year.*** This numbers are explained below, stating the yearly market size each of those 8 diseases aim for.

&#x200B;

1 - 2 "" Due to COVID-19, the market for ***PNH and aHUS*** was anticipated to grow from US$ 4855 million in 2020 to US$ ***7023 million*** by 2026; it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.89% during 2021–2026.""

3 - “ ***Anca vasculitis*** prevalence in the USA rounds 10-20 per million = 3300-6600 patients. As a treatment example we use Soliris, which costs $500,000/year. We would aim for ***1,65B - 3.3B*** market size as of now. Expected to grow by 2025""

4 - “"" The global systemic ***lupus erythematosus*** market size is expected to reach ***USD 3.08 billion*** by 2025, according to a new report by Grand View Research, Inc., exhibiting a CAGR of 7.0% during the forecast period. ""

5 - 8 “""***IgAN.*** The gathered disease prevalence data varies according to in which coutry the study has been undergone. Data gathered from the undergone study in East Asia, show the prevalence rounds 45 / million. meaning 14,850 patients, or a potential ***7,25B*** market size using Soliris's yearly price ""

6 - ""***C3G:*** Prevalence in the USA round 14-140 per 1M people = 4620-46,200 patients. If those patients were to be treated with Soliris which costs $500,000 / year, the potential market size we aim for rounds ***2,31B - 23,1B*** ""

7 - "" ***PMN*** prevalence is similar to the one of IgAN, so we would potentially aim for a similar market size, meaning ***7.25B***""

&#x200B;

* **4.5.6 Alexion buy out**

On December the 12th, 2020 ***Alexion announced that AstraZeneca was going to buy them out for 39B***. More than ***90% of their revenue come from their “""""Factor D""""” C5 inhibitor,*** being that the main reason why AstraZeneca wanted that buy out to happen.

You might think, why does this matter? Well, remember we have a Factor D which has shown to be more effective than Alexion’s, and is able to treat more diseases than they do aswell. This buy out reflects how ***undervalued BCX9930 is.***

Apart from the buy out, I think it's essential to mention that ***Alexion bought Achillion's ""Factor D"" when it was in Ph2 for $930MM.***

In ***2019*** Alexion's SOLIRIS® (eculizumab) net product sales were ***$3,946.4 million***. Soliris is currently approved to treat ***PNH and aHUS***. Have in mind BCX9930 is able to treat 8 diseases, aiming for a wider market, while having greater efficacy/safety profile.

As a quick ***example***, using the average biotech mid-cap ***x7*** revenue multiplier, and the revenue ***Soliris*** managed to generate in 2019, ***3,964B = 27,748B***. It would mean a ***SP value of $157.56*** for ***BCRX***. I want to make clear again that BCX9930 is said to be best in-class treatment and it's able to treat more diseases, therefore aims for a bigger revenue opportunity.

&#x200B;

* **4.5.7 Soliris/Ultomoris patients survey**

BCRX recently did a ***survey with 23 patients***, 12 of them using ***Ultomiris*** and the other 11 ***Soliris.*** The survey showed that ***91% of the patients were interested in switching*** due to the reasons explained in the pic below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6wsb9hchup171.png?width=1448&format=png&auto=webp&s=d92b1a169e593a7ac3152237092e3efd8468ee70

Some of the ***patients treated with BCX9930*** were asked some questions, among them, the ***6th*** one expressed his ***desire to be able to be treated with BCX9930 oral pill.*** As we have seen it before with Orladeyo, patients are ***highly willing to switch from needles to oral-pill*** form treatments.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* **4.5.8 BCX9930 From a Ph1 to a Ph3**

&#x200B;

On March 22, 2021 BCX9930 PNH Ph1 data was shown, the obtained ***results were so good that it enabled BCX9930 jump from a*** ***Ph1 to a pivotal Ph3 trial in PNH***\*\*\*, totally skipping the Ph2.\*\*\*

Additional ***proof of concept BCX9930*** ***Ph2 trials in Renal Complement-Mediated diseases*** will be made.

Straight ***jumping from a*** ***ph1 to a pivotal ph3*** trial, is something that's ***not common in the bio world*** and could be taken as a really ***bullish sign***. Apart from it being a bullish sign, it ***accelerates the process of development of the drug***, giving it a chance to ***hit the market in a smaller span of ti***

&#x200B;

* **4.5.9** **BCX9930 valuation**

Having in mind BCX9930 is a ***potential*** ***best-in-class treatment***, that Alexion got bought out for 39B mainly for their “Factor D” c5 inhibitor, and the yearly market size BCX9930 aims for in 2025 rounds the $28,56B - $51B mark. BCX9930 valuation can not be less than a ***30% of Alexion’s buy out price***, this is ***11.7B meaning 66.44$.***

&#x200B;

[BCX9930 value: 66.44$ SP](https://preview.redd.it/phh7inljup171.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2994d05aec97ea91d0e085ed352ce68ce2c217c)

&#x200B;

* **5. Strong BO Buy Out candidate**

As we have explained in the Institutional section before, all good bio-tech investors do know who Alexander ***J.Denner founder of Sarissa Capital*** is. After recently ***increasing his stake in BCRX***, along with BlackRock, he now ***owns a 5%*** of Biocryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Denner, has increased his position in BCRX by an stunning ***789% in the last 3 quarters***, showing ***strong conviction*** in the company.

Since Denner opened his position in Alexion, it took him 5 months to close the buy out deal, as shown in the picture below

📷

https://preview.redd.it/of897ahmup171.png?width=1300&format=png&auto=webp&s=abc2123461c38ce6d62c8320916416b87267db02

After this exhaustive analysis on the company, we can easily acknowledge that BCRX is more than a ***strong BO candidate***. A buy out coming from ***BIIB***, company ***where Denner forms part of the BOD board of directors,*** would make total sense ***in the following 2 years*** once BCX9930 Factor D phase III data is unveiled.

It also is important to mention that ***Bank of America added BCRX to the list of top M&A candidates ( Mergers and Acquisitions )*** as of October 30th, 2020. Stating how they believe BCRX will have a ***strong revenue growth in the incoming years.***

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* **6. Alexion's performance with Soliris**

As we have explained before, Alexion Pharmaceuticals has its own """"""""Factor D"""""""" C5 inhibitor inhibitor called Soliris.

Alexion could be the perfect example to have an idea of what we could expect from Biocryst's in the incoming years. ***From 2007 to 2014 Alexion's stock price grew a 1777%***. Being valued at ***10.5$ in 2007 and 186.6$ in 2014.***

Revenue generated by Alexion gradually grew up as their Factor D was approved to treat additional diseases, and the market size it captured became wider.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6ix67squup171.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4bf5e078a9461e9e4c067833d7af2f9d802da8f

Biocryst Pharmaceuticals managing to do the SP move Alexion did, is more than ***doable*** with the unique pipeline it possess. Having in mind ***Alexion made 66.4 MM revenue the first year while BCRX expects to generate 500 MM plus with Orladeyo,*** apart from it, additional revenue generated by ***Rapivab/Galidesivir stockpillings*** may come. Incoming Earning Reports are meant to be potential catalysts for the company, gradually becoming more meaningful as the market size they capture with Orladeyo becomes wider.

&#x200B;

* **7.** **De-risked company**

Last December the 7th, 2020 BCRX announced they made a Royalty ***agreement with Royalty Pharma and Athyrium Capital Management.*** With this agreement BCRX was funded with ***$325,000,000 in order to support Orladeyo launch***. Setting the company in an attractive position of ***not needing to do any money rising ""Offering"".***

***Jon Stonehouse CEO***, also confirmed that the company will ***not need to do offerings anymore.*** The fact that the company is already generating revenue with Orladeyo is another strong evidence that confirms money risings will not be needed anymore.

It's important to restate that as part of the Royalty agreement, ***Royalty Pharma will receive a 1% on global net sales of BCX9930, if approved.*** Showing how ***bullish they are on BCX9930*** and their willingness to invest at it.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gezetorvup171.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6880f64de595b224faf806b09f22385ba88dabf

&#x200B;

* **8. Forward looking statements**

&#x200B;

1. From now on ***EarningReports should be catalysts and positive for the company,*** obtaining better results each quarter as the company settles down and receives additional approvals for Orladeyo in different countries.
2. Orladeyo ***European launch.***
3. The company will have to provide some colour on the ***BCX9930 PNH pivotal trial***, how it will be planned etc etc... Aswell as the ***PH2 trials*** in complement-mediated diseases.
4. ***BCX9250 Next steps*** should soon be shared by the company
5. ***BCX4430 Galidesivir*** recently completed a Ph1, additional information about the study may be given. It's important to mention that this study was fully funded by the NIAID.
6. ***Galidesivir/Rapivab stockpilling.***

&#x200B;

*From now on revenues/BCX9930 updates are the main catalysts.*

&#x200B;

* **9. Conclusion**

After this exhaustive analysis, we come to the conclusion that ***BCRX is severely undervalued***, and if we sum up the true value of the pipeline, it should be valued around ***180$***. The StockPrice fair value number will keep growing as we keep getting data updates from the on-going studies and Orladeyo revenues keep growing, making it an ***excellent long-term hold and buy out candidate.***

I currently do have a position in this company, my average entry price being around the 4$ range. My initial plan is to hold the shares for the long term, at least 2 years more provided that we don't get bought out earlier. I expect the StockPrice to keep rising as Orladeyo revenues flow in and BCX9930 trials keep progressing, aswell as the rest of the pipeline.",nmfr14,BCRX DD - The Embarrassment of Riches

**TL;DR:** 

**Buy CHWY 06/11 75.5/76 Strangle**  

**Sell before market close on June 10**

As the earnings announcement gets closer, the implied volatility (IV) should increase. Now Vega--the greek responsible for the jiggle factor--reflects the option price's sensitivity to the change in IV. Higher IV means higher options price.   


IV:

* Last Earnings Call (March 30, 2021): \~75%
* Currently (May 27, 2021): 58.2%
* Difference: 16.8%

  
Options Contracts:

* 06/11 75.5P
   * Vega: 0.061
   * Current Price: $4.15
   * Expected price increase due to vega: (0.061 \* 16.8) = $1.02
* 06/11 76C
   * Vega: 0.061
   * Current Price: $4.05
   * Expected price increase due to vega: (0061 \* 16.8) = $1.02  


Total Entry Price: $8.20/contract  
Total Price Increase due to vega: $2.04  


Expected ROI: 24.8%

After the decimation of the US oil industry last year, CRK is also profiting nicely from their oil reserves. And with OPEC constantly pushing for higher prices, this will continue for the foreseeable future.

Ngl this seems like a prettt solid play rn low volume and it’s just been on the slow and steady rise 

This is a real game-changing technology which can offer a real alternative with an interchangeable battery technology for the existing lithium-ion batteries in almost every application with GMG’s Graphene and UQ’s patent-pending aluminum ion battery technology. The current nominal voltage of our batteries is 1.7 volts, and work is being carried out to increase the voltage to directly replace existing batteries and which lead to higher energy densities.

The real differentiator about these batteries is their very high power density of up to 7000 watts/kg, which endows them with a very high charge rate. Furthermore, graphene aluminum-ion batteries provide major benefits in terms of longer battery life (over 2000 charge / discharge cycles testing so far with no deterioration in performance), battery safety (very low fire potential) and lower environmental impact (more recyclable).

graph looks good. good buy. but if u want idk. not a professional buy at ur own risk. yeah.🚀.

Okay! Breakfast came early for You GMG.V Bulls. Its Pencil lead, not crayons today though, although Im hoping that someone with Market DD will post here in a bit and make us some fresh hot crayons. this is my first time on here doing anything like this, so go easy on me:

So here's some stuff I was able to get:

The only person with a science background That I can really find is their CSO:

Ashock Kumar Nanjundan CSO:

Pukyong National University

Degree Name: Doctor of Engineering

Materials Science

Current Adjunct professor at Queensland University (Gotta Do Something for the Kids Right)

Publications:

I’ll Let you guys go to sci hub to download this review for yourself, But the TLDR is that this dude knows his shit on how to dope graphene to get it to work as a battery.

Cited by: 178, For less academic Apes this means that 178 other scientists were like “yeah this dude knows his shit, Imma cite what he’s saying ~basically~ as fact.

https://doi.org/10.1039/C6EE00158K

Ashock’s most cited individual work comes from his first post-doc that he completed in Korea.

Polyaniline-Grafted Reduced Graphene Oxide for Efficient Electrochemical Supercapacitors.

Basically he does some pretty no-brainer synthesys to link graphene and another semi-conducting polymer that really enhances the graphene properties (Pretty nobrainer basic polymer bro shit, even so, it look like he probably wrote good supporting info and saved a lot of people a lot of time).

https://doi.org/10.1021/nn204688c

Total citations for all work combined: 3,845

This is pretty damn good for someone so young.

Here is a research paper that I'm having trouble accessing that seems to be relevant to this company's work on aluminum-graphene based batteries. If anyone can find it, DM me!

https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202010569

All in all, based on what I can see from linkedin about this company, they have a great CSO. He does seem to be both teaching and doing research in academia. He was recently brought up from a “Head Product Scientist” role to a CSO role, so hopefully this change will reflect a move away from more general research and towards really developing this stuff for GMG.V

I’m concerned about product development at this company, specifically it's unclear who is managing it. I’m not able to see every employee linkedin, but it may be that one of the people not visible is leading product development. You might be thinking ~but wait~ what if there is a group of slave PHD students/postdocs at the university of Queensland working on this stuff?  Yes there is. Nanjundan has some connections with the YU group (https://aibn.uq.edu.au/yu.)) And then here is a press release about it. (https://graphenemg.com/gmg-the-university-of-queensland-research-uni-quest-kick-off-the-graphene-enhanced-aluminium-ion-battery-development-project/)

It sounds like the company has recently had some really good results in R&D, but until I can see and Audit the product/process development lead, ill probably avoid going all in $$.

~sometimes~ the COO role at these companies can be a technical role that helps with process development, but the COO looks to be doing mostly operations type stuff and is non-technical. Not wholly worrisome, but I do want to see  more listed employees on linkedin and then someone that is leading doing process development/scale up and quality control… quality assurance wouldn't hurt either.

It also looks like this company is casting a wide net of potential products, but it's entirely unclear if it has launched any of them. Hopefully it does. It feels uncommon these days for a company to go the IPO route so early on in R&D, most will look to do venture capital funding first to launch a few products. Is this an australian thing? Or is this just crowdfunding with extra steps? If you have more info, lets talk

I'm a materials science ape and don't know anything about Stock Market DD, but why not rely on science DD to decide on investments?


Anyway yeah it seems like a solid play. It dipped a bit today but looking at financials i see nothing but greatness for this stock. not financial advice.

Can someone inform me why people are saying this? I don’t want this to inform me about the wrong information. Thanks everyone",nmitn3,Why Are People Saying That AMC Can Hit 500K+??!!

That being said, let's get down to business and what I have to say.

This month is going to be a wild ride. Volume is up 3x today and yesterday's volume was up 2x. This large volume and price movement could be the precursor to the second arm of a ""crab chart pattern"". Here's a crab and a chart to compare it to.

Left arm, body is completed, green brush is the right arm

Did you know crabs typically have one larger claw than the other? What this can be a metaphor for is that either the run we had was the big arm, or this next run will be the big arm. The green is my prediction of how the chart will look in the coming weeks.

It's impossible to confirm currently how large of a run this will be, but with how much institutional buying has happened and low short interest I can assume it will be much much higher. Likely blowing pasted the 28.76 mark into the $33+ range minimum. Retail and institutions are bullish, hold onto your shares tight.

So My question is: is it worth going for a the long haul or should I listen to all the sites and sources that say carnival isn’t a great company to invest in, and will likely not become much more successful than it was pre-rona?

Here's a little boost of confidence. Currently, Ford still qualifies under the <200k limit; this new bill (if passed) would boost the $7,500 EV tax credit to $12,500 (for Ford bc their cars are both built-in USA + have labor unions). In its current form, this would help both GM, Ford, and Tesla. Even if it's modified for a smaller tax credit or amount of vehicles, Ford is reaping the most benefits here.

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀


Already powering many of the telematics of current cars, BB is poised to benefit from their established relationships with big automakers. Getting certified with an automaker is not easy, so it is a barrier to entry for other companies wanting in on the action. Security and reliability are top of mind for these companies. You don’t want your car to get hacked easily, so what better than a cybersecurity company that happens to also do EV software, and already has experience with ICE cars. I did a long DD here 4 months ago and still stand by it: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxknrl/bb_dd_9_reasons_why_bb_is_from_former_bb_employee/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf


SONY:
100 shares at $101
🚀🚀🚀


I wouldn’t call this the Japanese equivalent for BB, as they aren’t a cybersecurity company. But Sony has a thriving consumer and B2B business that benefits greatly from consumer demand: the fact that they are literally selling every single PS5 they make is amazing and image sensors going out on many cell phones, including Apple using both image and lidar sensors from Sony. Great solid volume of sales to stabilize the company after some stagnant years.

On PS5, it’s actually a good thing that there’s a chip shortage. As Sony loses money on the hardware (and earn on game royalties and licenses), they are buying time to refine their manufacturing to lower costs, and lose less money on hardware sales. And because demand is so hot for the PS5, they are on track to build a bigger platform than even PS4 to charge 20-30% on every game they sell. That’s some fat margin.

Now, you’re probably wondering…wtf, I’m here to read about EVs, why you telling me about PS5s? Yeah, you’re right but a conglomerate like Sony is multifaceted. While they build up their EV software platform, they have cash cows in imagery and video games. And if Apple is really building an EV, I would bet (am literally betting) that they would rely on currently trusted partners like Sony for their imaging needs. You sit inside an Apple car and camera recognizes who you are and where you’re sitting? Well that’s probably a Sony camera…or 20 of them. There will be so many cameras inside and outside of any Apple car. I mean…my iPhone 12 has 4 cameras, and it’s a tiny slab of glass and my family can’t sit inside and drive down the road with others in the environment.

And when Japanese automakers get into EVs, they’ll look into a Japanese partnership. Guess who’s probably in pole position?

Full disclosure, I also have 150 AAPL.



VW:
200 shares @ $33.32
🚀🚀🚀🚀

You are all excited about Ford. I am too but I’m not buying into them because I think they are overhyped. But what’s interesting about Ford’s EV play is that they are partnering with VW to do so. That means…even if Ford can’t sell that many cars, VW will probably still benefit from joint research development and cost sharing. We also know how much more climate change is viewed as reality in Europe, and that’s VW’s home territory. VW already launching EVs under Audi, Porsche in the premium sector, VW, Skoda and Seat in the value sector, and Bentley and Lamborghini will likely have their ultra premium EVs soon.

But you might wonder…what about Tesla? They are so great! Well yeah they aren’t that bad. But VW is a goddamn monster. It’s kind of cute when Tesla announces a new plant, oh this is my 4th plant! We now have Shanghai and Fremont and building out Berlin and Austin. That’s cute. VW has 136 plants around the world. The economies of scale is insane and will be able to source materials for incredibly better deals. Oh and there’s that other partner called Ford who builds millions of cars a year also jumping into to beat on suppliers to give them both better pricing. Welcome to the big leagues, EVs.

VW is likely to launching 5-10 EVs per year, the equivalent the full Tesla line up every year. And they have Electricfy America network (and Canada) and similar in Europe.

And one more thing: VW also does trucks. Like 18 wheeler trucks. They are one of the biggest manufacturers, behind brands such as Man, Scania, and Navistar. And trucks have even more of a compelling business case for EVs…Will merge this part with Volvo.


Volvo:
800 shares @ $26
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀


Going to keep this briefer because this is already a novel. Now, when I say Volvo, I don’t mean Volvo Cars. That’s bought by Geely and yes they are making EVs under Volvo and Polestar brands. But I’m taking about AB Volvo, still out of Sweden, building trucks, mining equipment, backhoes, haul trucks and cranes.

EVs are so more more compelling because of the use and mileage they get. It’s not uncommon for a one year old truck to have a million miles. And as cities around the world clamp down on urban center access (congestion or polluter fees common in Europe, and allow EVs in for discount or free), EVs increasingly make more sense. You save so much on lower op/maintenance costs, avoiding tolls and tax credits. Oil prices will be going back up so saving on fuel costs is the smart thing to do.

Another thing is, governments around the world are spending trillions on infrastructure stimulus. What do these trillions buy? Concrete, steel, Volvo construction equipment, labor. Where does the concrete, steel and other commodities (like rising gold and silver prices) come from? They get mined out of the ground with big Caterpillar, Liebherr and Volvo equipment. Yep, there’s Volvo again!

So if you believe stimulus is happening, Volvo is a good choice. If you believe inflation is real, Volvo is a good choice. If you believe EV is the future for hauling shorter distances and/or heavy loads, Volvo is a good choice.

8781,,2021-05-27 18:06:29,t3_nmdjep,,wallstreetbets,"Clearly, the company Shopify {SHOP} is in a market that is growing as it was showing before the beginning of the pandemic already -when the stock rose up to $500. I mean who doesn't believe in the internet here :-\]

During the pandemic, this SOFTWARE company helped a lot of smaller and midsize businesses as they were easily able to set up an e-commerce presence with Shopify's help. As a result, SHOP revenue increased a lot and the stock got propelled up to a crazy over 200 times forward earnings and a still to high current $$ 1240 price tag today. Yeah, that is my opinion only but Note: At the last press conference they said that operating cost will increase \[and by revenue increase will slow down\], THEY SAID IT - but nobody wants to hear it. 

You may wonder why to believe me if everybody can see that the stock price didn't fall back to a quite logic 60 times earnings \[like FANG Stocks for example\] ... meaning about 7-800 Dollars ...  

Well, SHOP was falling but then ...   
I can only assume that the three leaving executives teamed up with some other people who are interested in bumping the stock up again. Together they started an extensive press campaign, the one that we see even today: ""Shopify poised to go up"" I read today? Is it not that always when another one of these messages comes out A LOT OF stocks are suddenly traded? And that when the price goes up \[and even down\] it is often a very controlled 40bucks a day?    


IF you still want to read more, let's look up that complete marketing campaign to bring the SHOP stock up again:   
First Shopify was compared with Amazon itself - which is laughable. Even Karl Marx knew already that capitalism tends to create a monopoly. Shopify ... by helping all the little and medium companies with their software is the exact opposite of Amazon. Not to mention that the malls are full again ... meaning fewer people will buy online than during the pandemic. Which at least in the short and midterm will bring online revenues down a bit.

Then Google mentioned some Google button that makes it easier to find Shopify customers. Well yes but that doesn't help Shopify results at all. AND it makes clear that Shopify customers severely lack visibility compared with an omnipotent Amazon.   
   
Then the Shopify payment system was hyped. Buy now pay later? REALLY? The """"have's"""" have credit cards and pay with them as they even get perks/payback and points for it. So who uses the buy now pay later system? The ""DO NOT HAVE's with only a half-decent credit score of course.

Sorry but when I read about this I was only able to imagine the Shopify payment system as a """"buy now pay NEVER"""" system and I certainly had no idea how this helps the Shopify stock in the long run. Do the revenue numbers go up in the quarterly results? What about liabilities? 

Then SHOP was mentioned as the ""stock to have"" in 2021 ?? Not even worth a comment. 

For me, the only thing that is ""poised to happen"" is that the pockets of the three leaving former executives of Shopify are filled and that the buying retail investors are screwed over in about 2 months' time with a two-digit percentage loss. 

And I write all this while I actually like the Shopify story, as I like Tesla and so many things that are happening with all these wonderful tech companies ...  
But IMO the SHOP stock goes back to $800 exactly as Tesla went down from 900\[intraday\] to now 600...

Well, Good luck, give me your thoughts and I hope the bots even allow a huge and way too long posting like this.",nmdjep,My thoughts about all the stories published on SHOP Stock recently

**○ 4.1 Orladeyo**™ **(Berotralstat) oral pill**

&#x200B;

Orladeyo is the ***first Oral approved*** treatment used to prevent swelling attacks in people with ***hereditary angioedema (HAE)*****,** disease which is estimated to affect ***1 in 50,000 people***

&#x200B;

\- Orladeyo was firstly approved in the ***USA*** ***December the 3rd,*** ***2020. Q4***

\- Orladeyo received ***Japan*** NHI price listing approval ***April the 14th, 2021. Q2***

\- Orladeyo received ***Europe*** approval ***April the 30th, 2021 Q2***

\- Orladeyo received ***UK*** approval ***May the 12th, 2021 Q2***

&#x200B;

***CEO*** himself Jon Stonehouse ***confirmed*** in the [last conference call, ( 22:15 )](https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/mqqo89/bcrx_biocryst_apr_14_2021_at_845_am_edt_20th/) ***Orladeyo will annually*** be generating ***$500MM plus revenue.***

\-Serge Belanger ( ***Analyst*** ): I think in the past you've talked about ***sales potential for Orladeyo of 500 million plus***, are you still reiterating that target?

\- Stonehouse ( ***CEO*** ): ***Yeah make sure you remember the plus.***

&#x200B;

***Orladeyo*** is [ranked](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/pharmacy/20-most-expensive-prescription-drugs-in-2021.html) the ***#13 most expensive drug*** ***in the USA*** market. ***$37,308*** is approximately what patients must monthly pay to access the drug.

&#x200B;

***Before oral Orladeyo*** was approved for HAE, ***patients*** would only have treatments that required usage of ***needles***. This dramatically ***reduced the*** ***quality of their life***, making some of them quit using the treatment. That's the main ***reason*** why ***Orladeyo is a game changer***.

&#x200B;

As it's shown in[ the January 2021 Corporate Presentation](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 16), Physicians expect to Prescribe ***Orladeyo for over 40% of HAE Patients.***

&#x200B;

* **4.1.1** **Pricings/Revenue**

&#x200B;

**USA**

In the USA there currently are 10,000 patients, ***7500 diagnosed and treated,*** 1700 diagnosed but not treated, 600 treated but not diagnosed.

Physicians expect to prescribe Orladeyo for over 41% of HAE patients. Conservatively thinking, taking 7,500 patients ( the diagnosed and treated ones ) out of the total 10,000 pool in the USA, with over[ 41% of patients prescription](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) ( page 16 ) we would conservatively aim for ***3,075 patients.***

The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in the USA, is equal to ***485,000$***

&#x200B;

**Japan**

On November the 5th Biocryst undergone an agreement with ***Torii Pharmaceuticals.*** A local Japanese company that will be in charge of getting new patients to be treated with Orladeyo in Japan and commerzialing it.

Japan has around 2,500 HAE patients, and Biocryst conservatively expects to ***at*** ***least reach 500 patients.***

The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in Japan, is equal to ***$248,500***

***Approval of Orladeyo in Japan issued a $15MM milestone payment*** from Torii.

***BioCryst will receive*** tiered royalties ranging from ***20% - 40% of Japanese sales.***

&#x200B;

**Europe**

It's estimated to be around ***12,000 HAE patients in Europe.*** Following the physician prescription of over[ 41% of patients to prescribe](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 16) for Orladeyo. We get a total of ***4,920 patients*** in Europe.

Since pricings and jurisdictions work in a different way in Europe, the amount of money each patient will have to pay for Orladeyo is expected to be around or above Japan's ***$248,500/year.*** This number should soon be confirmed.

With this yearly prices and the amount of patients defined before, we get the following results.

&#x200B;

\- ***USA - 3,075p x 485K = 1,491,375,000$***

\- ***Japan - 500p x 248,5K = 124,250,000$***

\- ***EU - 4,920p x 248,5K = 1,222,620,000$***

&#x200B;

Summing it all up we get $2,751,270,000. From that number we have to subtract 123,100,000$ making it a total of ***$2,628,170,000***. The sustraction happens as a result of the undergone Royalty agreement with Torii Pharmaceuticals and Royalty Pharma.

&#x200B;

* **4.1.2 Q1 EarningsReport Beat**

&#x200B;

On May the 6th, 2021 BCRX presented Q1 Earnings Report data which managed to ***Beat Analysts estimates***. Basically what matters from this ***Q1 ER*** is that it was the ***launch of Orladeyo***, and Analysts wanted to see a decent amount of money generated by it. They were expecting Orladeyo sales to top ***$3.1MM*** ***and Orladeyo actually generated*** ***$10.94MM***, this is a ***353% sales beat***

The consequence of the ER beat was an increase of ***24.06%*** in the ***SP***

&#x200B;

It's ***important*** to mention that ***revenues generated this Q1*** only came from the ***USA.***

This ***Q2 Orladeyo*** has been ***approved in Japan/Europe/UK*** aswell, adding new sources of revenue.

***Orladeyo sales*** are expected to ***grow exponentially*** each quarter. Main reason for it is that it has been approved in the countries mentioned above. The other reason is that the amount of ***patients*** they treat will slowly ***score up*** as insurance companies allow their clients to be treated with this drug.

&#x200B;

* **4.1.3 Orladeyo value**

Having in mind the discussed numbers before, Orladeyo alone will be generating ***$2,628,170,000*** a year, using the average mid-cap Biotech company multiplier **x7**. We get a total of ***$18,397,190,000*** meaning an increase of ***$104,46*** in the stock price.

&#x200B;

[Orladeyo value: 104,46$ SP](https://preview.redd.it/9gm01v0ztp171.png?width=1403&format=png&auto=webp&s=fabf3e8b02342dadb174cef96f8428ac44421c7f)

**○ 4.2 Peramivir** ™ **(Rapivab)**

Peramivir (Rapivab) is an antiviral drug for the treatment of influenza. Peramivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor, acting as a transition-state analogue inhibitor of influenza neuraminidase and thereby preventing new viruses from emerging from infected cells. It is approved for intravenous administration.

On 19 December 2014, the FDA approved Peramivir to treat influenza infection in adults. Peramivir has also been approved in Japan and South Korea and is available in Japan as Rapiacta and in South Korea as Peramiflu.

The U.S. government (department of Health and Human Services) gave BioCryst Pharmaceuticals more than $77 million to finish the Phase III clinical development of peramivir. In 2009 the department of Health and Human Services had already given about $180 million to the program.

In 2013 the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA/HHS) released new funding under the current $234.8 million contract to enable completion of a New Drug Application filing for intravenous (IV) peramivir.

&#x200B;

* **4.2.1** **Peramivir value**

With all the explanations given above and having in mind Peramivir is a government bio-defense drug the value of Rapivab can not be less than ***$500,000,000*** conservatively speaking.

&#x200B;

[Peramivir value: $2,84 SP](https://preview.redd.it/gc09kk81up171.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e7fee79582328b95e4db5853fb52c5590dc8b55)

&#x200B;

**○ 4.3 Galidesivir - BCX4430**

Galidesivir (BCX4430) is a broad-spectrum antiviral in advanced development for the treatment of viruses that pose a threat to health and national security, including SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of COVID-19), Ebola, Marburg, Yellow Fever and Zika.

The NIAID and BARDA have been funding the development and testing of Galidesivir for over 15 years as they recognize its importance in preparation for all future pandemics. The 31st of August, 2020 NIAID Awarded $44 Million Contract to Advance Development of Galidesivir.

Galidesivir has also demonstrated broad-spectrum activity in vitro against more than 20 ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses in nine different families, including coronaviruses, filoviruses, togaviruses, bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, paramyxoviruses and flaviviruses. (Hepatitis C, West Nile, Dengue, Jap Encephalitis, Yellow Fever, TBEV, OHFV, and Zika), orthomyxoviruses and picornaviruses..

Galidesivir is the first antiviral that has ever shown such potential, and to top it off, it is now known from the Phase I trial and now the Brazil part 1 trial to clearly be safe and show dose-sensitive effects in people. And based on multiple animal studies, it works equally effectively as a pill that is stable for years at room temperature. Not only that, but this antiviral, unlike any of the others, has excellent penetration of the blood brain barrier as was seen in the macaque Zika virus study.

&#x200B;

* **4.3.1 Efficacy**

Galidesivir was safe and generally well tolerated in Phase 1 clinical safety and pharmacokinetics trials by both intravenous and intramuscular routes of administration in healthy subjects. In animal studies, galidesivir has demonstrated survival benefits against a variety of serious pathogens, including Ebola, Marburg, Yellow Fever and Zika viruses.

The company on December 22nd announced that all three doses were perfectly safe for the patients. In addition, they found that patients had a dose-sensitive reduction in virus levels in their lungs. They went on to say that an animal model, showed that Galidesivir significantly reduced COVID-19-associated lung damage.

&#x200B;

* **4.3.2 Galidesivir value**

We must have in mind that Galidesivir is a Government funded bio-defense drug, that aims to treat a wide range of viruses as explained before. Its global stockpiling for future pandemics is also an absolute certainty given its long-term stability. With all the given explanations, conservatively talking Galidesivir can not be worth less than ***$1B this is 5,67$***.

**○ 4.4 FOP - BCX9250**

FOP is an ultra-rare, severely disabling condition characterized by the irregular formation of bone outside the normal skeleton, also known as heterotopic ossification (HO). HO can occur in muscles, tendons and soft tissue. Patients with FOP become bound by this irregular ossification over time, with restricted movement and fused joints, resulting in deformities and premature mortality. There are currently no approved treatments for FOP.

There are an estimated 3,500 to 9,000 patients worldwide, with 900 diagnosed so far. Currently there aren’t any approved treatments.

Market size for this treatment is estimated to reach 500M-900M in 2025, growing to 3B in 2028 as more patients are diagnosed. With a price ranging from $900K-$1M/year.

Last December the 21st Biocryst announced positive Phase 1 results

“BCX9250 was safe and well tolerated at all doses studied, with linear and dose-proportional exposure supporting once-daily dosing.”.

“In preclinical studies, BCX9250 demonstrated potency for the target kinase, selectivity, safety and strong suppression of HO in animal models.”

&#x200B;

* **4.4.1 BCX9250 Value**

BCX9250 study will most likely take 4 years to finish, this is, until 2025. By then the potential market we will be aimming for, will be $750,000,000 aprox.

Drugs that are in Phase 1 studies are said to have a 10% chance of making it to the market. Following that, BCX9250 as of now shuld be valued at ***$75,000,000 = 0.43$***

**○ 4.5 Oral Factor D inhibitor - BCX9930**

&#x200B;

BCX9930 is a novel, ***oral***, potent and selective small molecule ***inhibitor of Factor D*** which recently completed Phase 1 clinical development for the treatment of complement-mediated diseases.

The 3rd of August 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted ***Fast Track designation*** for oral Factor D inhibitor, BCX9930.

***This is how Bill Sheridan*** ( *Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President )* defined [BCX9930 in the last conference call ( 22:00 )](https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/mqqo89/bcrx_biocryst_apr_14_2021_at_845_am_edt_20th/)

***""BCX9930 is a really terrifically exciting project, this is a potent specific Factor D inhibitor. So, the mechanism of action is to block the enzymatic activity of that complement enzyme, that enzyme sits at the very start of the alternative pathway of complement. So, that opens up a whole set of opportunities across diferent diseases that are driven by dysregulation of that alternative pathway of complement and the amplification loop that's embedded in that pathway""***

&#x200B;

* **4.5.1** **Staff excitement**

Staff team from Biocryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc seem to be really positive and ***excited*** about the incoming ***future of BCX9930***. Such excitement has been seen in the last conference calls where staff members such as the CEO Jon P.Stonehouse, or the Vice President, William P.Sheridan would say the ***following words.***

&#x200B;

***“Embarrassment of riches”***

***“We agree with Alexion that creating a potent specific and great oral Factor D inhibitor is a great challenge, and we are happy we have one”***

***“My only concern is i have no concerns”***

***“Pipeline in a molecule”***

***“My aim is to make c5 inhibitors obsolete”***

***“This is Big”***

""***BCX9930 is a really terrifically exciting project""***

&#x200B;

* **4.5.2** **Phase I study**

On March 22, 2021 BCRX announced that ***BCX9930 will be advancing from Ph1 to*** ***Pivotal*** ***Trials in PNH*** ***following the successful proof of concept trial.***

The company announced that a ***Pivotal trial for PNH***, and ***proof of concept trials*** in renal complement-mediated diseases are expected to begin in ***2H 2021.***

On March 22, the company unveiled BCX9930 ***Ph1 data***. The most relevant information from that Ph1 is mentioned below.

""***100%*** of treatment-naïve patients and **83%** of C5 inhibitor inadequate response patients were ***transfusion-free***. *Prior to the trial*, 22 percent of treatment-naïve patients and 17 percent of C5 inadequate responders were transfusion-free ""

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ybrsazv9up171.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=71a0ca39992d0ced02c0f723601e3fd784b92dd4

"" ***Hemoglobin levels increased*** by a mean of ***3.5 g/dL*** in treatment-naïve patients and ***3.2 g/dL*** in C5 inhibitor inadequate response patients; at last visit, mean hemoglobin levels were 11.8 g/dL and 12.2 g/dL, respectively ""

To understand properly how ***positive BCX9930 data was***, below you can find a photo that gathers the data from the main studies done in this kind of inhibitors. What mainly should catch your attention is the ***Hemoglobin change from baseline and the % of transfusion units reduction from baseline*** \- This data has been gathered by ***Barclays***.

&#x200B;

* **4.5.3  BCX9930 Study Primary End point change agreement with the FDA**

Recently the FDA changed the ***primary end-point*** of the BCX9930 study, for it to be the ***change of Hemoglobin level from baseline***. The ***secondary end-point would be the % transfusion free rate reduction.***

This news ***greatly benefit BCX9930's study*** considering how it has ***showed the strongest results in those 2 mentioned study end-points.***

&#x200B;

* **4.5.4 Alternative Pathway**

What makes BCX9930 a game changer, is the wide spectrum of Alternative Pathway Dysregulation disease it can treat. It can treat up to[ 8 diseases](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 26) as of now, that's why insiders call it ***“Pipeline in a molecule”***. Those ***8 diseases*** are shown in the pic below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/voe1863eup171.png?width=1273&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d8a29deed5089d09d8d6669e8b847894d74c786

1- PNH (Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria)

2 - aHUS (Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome)

3 - ANCA vasculitis (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis)

4 - Lupus Nephritis

5 - IgAN vasculitis

6 - C3G (Glomerulonephritis)

7 - PMN (Primary membranous nephropathy)

8 - IgAN (IgA nephropathy)

&#x200B;

* **4.5.5 Potential market size by 2025**

Assuming BCX9930 will be approved by 2025, and it will be able to treat the previously mentioned 8 diseases, we reach to the following conclusion. The potential ***market size BCX9930*** will be aiming for by 2025 scores up to ***$28,56B - $51B / year.*** This numbers are explained below, stating the yearly market size each of those 8 diseases aim for.

&#x200B;

1 - 2 "" Due to COVID-19, the market for ***PNH and aHUS*** was anticipated to grow from US$ 4855 million in 2020 to US$ ***7023 million*** by 2026; it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.89% during 2021–2026.""

3 - “ ***Anca vasculitis*** prevalence in the USA rounds 10-20 per million = 3300-6600 patients. As a treatment example we use Soliris, which costs $500,000/year. We would aim for ***1,65B - 3.3B*** market size as of now. Expected to grow by 2025""

4 - “"" The global systemic ***lupus erythematosus*** market size is expected to reach ***USD 3.08 billion*** by 2025, according to a new report by Grand View Research, Inc., exhibiting a CAGR of 7.0% during the forecast period. ""

5 - 8 “""***IgAN.*** The gathered disease prevalence data varies according to in which coutry the study has been undergone. Data gathered from the undergone study in East Asia, show the prevalence rounds 45 / million. meaning 14,850 patients, or a potential ***7,25B*** market size using Soliris's yearly price ""

6 - ""***C3G:*** Prevalence in the USA round 14-140 per 1M people = 4620-46,200 patients. If those patients were to be treated with Soliris which costs $500,000 / year, the potential market size we aim for rounds ***2,31B - 23,1B*** ""

7 - "" ***PMN*** prevalence is similar to the one of IgAN, so we would potentially aim for a similar market size, meaning ***7.25B***""

&#x200B;

* **4.5.6 Alexion buy out**

On December the 12th, 2020 ***Alexion announced that AstraZeneca was going to buy them out for 39B***. More than ***90% of their revenue come from their “""""Factor D""""” C5 inhibitor,*** being that the main reason why AstraZeneca wanted that buy out to happen.

You might think, why does this matter? Well, remember we have a Factor D which has shown to be more effective than Alexion’s, and is able to treat more diseases than they do aswell. This buy out reflects how ***undervalued BCX9930 is.***

Apart from the buy out, I think it's essential to mention that ***Alexion bought Achillion's ""Factor D"" when it was in Ph2 for $930MM.***

In ***2019*** Alexion's SOLIRIS® (eculizumab) net product sales were ***$3,946.4 million***. Soliris is currently approved to treat ***PNH and aHUS***. Have in mind BCX9930 is able to treat 8 diseases, aiming for a wider market, while having greater efficacy/safety profile.

As a quick ***example***, using the average biotech mid-cap ***x7*** revenue multiplier, and the revenue ***Soliris*** managed to generate in 2019, ***3,964B = 27,748B***. It would mean a ***SP value of $157.56*** for ***BCRX***. I want to make clear again that BCX9930 is said to be best in-class treatment and it's able to treat more diseases, therefore aims for a bigger revenue opportunity.

&#x200B;

* **4.5.7 Soliris/Ultomoris patients survey**

BCRX recently did a ***survey with 23 patients***, 12 of them using ***Ultomiris*** and the other 11 ***Soliris.*** The survey showed that ***91% of the patients were interested in switching*** due to the reasons explained in the pic below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6wsb9hchup171.png?width=1448&format=png&auto=webp&s=d92b1a169e593a7ac3152237092e3efd8468ee70

Some of the ***patients treated with BCX9930*** were asked some questions, among them, the ***6th*** one expressed his ***desire to be able to be treated with BCX9930 oral pill.*** As we have seen it before with Orladeyo, patients are ***highly willing to switch from needles to oral-pill*** form treatments.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gvc24l6iup171.png?width=1462&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b2d790ba79514155d5d3a219e22e4ac4793e9a0

&#x200B;

* **4.5.8 BCX9930 From a Ph1 to a Ph3**

&#x200B;

On March 22, 2021 BCX9930 PNH Ph1 data was shown, the obtained ***results were so good that it enabled BCX9930 jump from a*** ***Ph1 to a pivotal Ph3 trial in PNH***\*\*\*, totally skipping the Ph2.\*\*\*

Additional ***proof of concept BCX9930*** ***Ph2 trials in Renal Complement-Mediated diseases*** will be made.

Straight ***jumping from a*** ***ph1 to a pivotal ph3*** trial, is something that's ***not common in the bio world*** and could be taken as a really ***bullish sign***. Apart from it being a bullish sign, it ***accelerates the process of development of the drug***, giving it a chance to ***hit the market in a smaller span of ti***

&#x200B;

* **4.5.9** **BCX9930 valuation**

Having in mind BCX9930 is a ***potential*** ***best-in-class treatment***, that Alexion got bought out for 39B mainly for their “Factor D” c5 inhibitor, and the yearly market size BCX9930 aims for in 2025 rounds the $28,56B - $51B mark. BCX9930 valuation can not be less than a ***30% of Alexion’s buy out price***, this is ***11.7B meaning 66.44$.***

&#x200B;

[BCX9930 value: 66.44$ SP](https://preview.redd.it/phh7inljup171.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2994d05aec97ea91d0e085ed352ce68ce2c217c)

&#x200B;

* **5. Strong BO Buy Out candidate**

As we have explained in the Institutional section before, all good bio-tech investors do know who Alexander ***J.Denner founder of Sarissa Capital*** is. After recently ***increasing his stake in BCRX***, along with BlackRock, he now ***owns a 5%*** of Biocryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Denner, has increased his position in BCRX by an stunning ***789% in the last 3 quarters***, showing ***strong conviction*** in the company.

Since Denner opened his position in Alexion, it took him 5 months to close the buy out deal, as shown in the picture below

📷

https://preview.redd.it/of897ahmup171.png?width=1300&format=png&auto=webp&s=abc2123461c38ce6d62c8320916416b87267db02

After this exhaustive analysis on the company, we can easily acknowledge that BCRX is more than a ***strong BO candidate***. A buy out coming from ***BIIB***, company ***where Denner forms part of the BOD board of directors,*** would make total sense ***in the following 2 years*** once BCX9930 Factor D phase III data is unveiled.

It also is important to mention that ***Bank of America added BCRX to the list of top M&A candidates ( Mergers and Acquisitions )*** as of October 30th, 2020. Stating how they believe BCRX will have a ***strong revenue growth in the incoming years.***

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* **6. Alexion's performance with Soliris**

As we have explained before, Alexion Pharmaceuticals has its own """"""""Factor D"""""""" C5 inhibitor inhibitor called Soliris.

Alexion could be the perfect example to have an idea of what we could expect from Biocryst's in the incoming years. ***From 2007 to 2014 Alexion's stock price grew a 1777%***. Being valued at ***10.5$ in 2007 and 186.6$ in 2014.***

Revenue generated by Alexion gradually grew up as their Factor D was approved to treat additional diseases, and the market size it captured became wider.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6ix67squup171.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4bf5e078a9461e9e4c067833d7af2f9d802da8f

Biocryst Pharmaceuticals managing to do the SP move Alexion did, is more than ***doable*** with the unique pipeline it possess. Having in mind ***Alexion made 66.4 MM revenue the first year while BCRX expects to generate 500 MM plus with Orladeyo,*** apart from it, additional revenue generated by ***Rapivab/Galidesivir stockpillings*** may come. Incoming Earning Reports are meant to be potential catalysts for the company, gradually becoming more meaningful as the market size they capture with Orladeyo becomes wider.

&#x200B;

* **7.** **De-risked company**

Last December the 7th, 2020 BCRX announced they made a Royalty ***agreement with Royalty Pharma and Athyrium Capital Management.*** With this agreement BCRX was funded with ***$325,000,000 in order to support Orladeyo launch***. Setting the company in an attractive position of ***not needing to do any money rising ""Offering"".***

***Jon Stonehouse CEO***, also confirmed that the company will ***not need to do offerings anymore.*** The fact that the company is already generating revenue with Orladeyo is another strong evidence that confirms money risings will not be needed anymore.

It's important to restate that as part of the Royalty agreement, ***Royalty Pharma will receive a 1% on global net sales of BCX9930, if approved.*** Showing how ***bullish they are on BCX9930*** and their willingness to invest at it.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gezetorvup171.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6880f64de595b224faf806b09f22385ba88dabf

&#x200B;

* **8. Forward looking statements**

&#x200B;

1. From now on ***EarningReports should be catalysts and positive for the company,*** obtaining better results each quarter as the company settles down and receives additional approvals for Orladeyo in different countries.
2. Orladeyo ***European launch.***
3. The company will have to provide some colour on the ***BCX9930 PNH pivotal trial***, how it will be planned etc etc... Aswell as the ***PH2 trials*** in complement-mediated diseases.
4. ***BCX9250 Next steps*** should soon be shared by the company
5. ***BCX4430 Galidesivir*** recently completed a Ph1, additional information about the study may be given. It's important to mention that this study was fully funded by the NIAID.
6. ***Galidesivir/Rapivab stockpilling.***

&#x200B;

*From now on revenues/BCX9930 updates are the main catalysts.*

&#x200B;

* **9. Conclusion**

After this exhaustive analysis, we come to the conclusion that ***BCRX is severely undervalued***, and if we sum up the true value of the pipeline, it should be valued around ***180$***. The StockPrice fair value number will keep growing as we keep getting data updates from the on-going studies and Orladeyo revenues keep growing, making it an ***excellent long-term hold and buy out candidate.***

I currently do have a position in this company, my average entry price being around the 4$ range. My initial plan is to hold the shares for the long term, at least 2 years more provided that we don't get bought out earlier. I expect the StockPrice to keep rising as Orladeyo revenues flow in and BCX9930 trials keep progressing, aswell as the rest of the pipeline.",nmfr14,BCRX DD - The Embarrassment of Riches

Because so much gamma expires tomorrow we think that AMC will likely consolidate as call options decay kicks in, which allows dealers to unwind some of their long stock hedge position.""

It is kind of strange since I couldn’t find anything about them online. Did someone of you use the app in the past? I downloaded it and it seems professional but also kind of shady because you can’t find it on the app or play store. They have a working help desk but they don’t answer every question I have about them. I’m not sure if it is safe to trade or to put money on my wallet there. Maybe someone of you did already work with that app. I’m really curious about the origin of that trading platform. Any info would be helpful.,nmgrpf,HIOXEX exchange

**TL;DR:** 

**Buy CHWY 06/11 75.5/76 Strangle**  

**Sell before market close on June 10**  


CHWY Earnings is June 10 AMC [Source](https://investor.chewy.com/news-and-events/news/news-details/2021/Chewy-Announces-Fiscal-First-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results-Conference-Call/default.aspx)

As the earnings announcement gets closer, the implied volatility (IV) should increase. Now Vega--the greek responsible for the jiggle factor--reflects the option price's sensitivity to the change in IV. Higher IV means higher options price.   


IV:

* Last Earnings Call (March 30, 2021): \~75%
* Currently (May 27, 2021): 58.2%
* Difference: 16.8%

  
Options Contracts:

* 06/11 75.5P
   * Vega: 0.061
   * Current Price: $4.15
   * Expected price increase due to vega: (0.061 \* 16.8) = $1.02
* 06/11 76C
   * Vega: 0.061
   * Current Price: $4.05
   * Expected price increase due to vega: (0061 \* 16.8) = $1.02  


Total Entry Price: $8.20/contract  
Total Price Increase due to vega: $2.04  


Expected ROI: 24.8%  


Sell before June 10 market close. 

&#x200B;

Positions:

* CHWY 06/11 76C @ 4.05
* CHWY 06/11 75.5P @ 4.15  


The bid-ask spread touched me in my no-no square. Vega will help make it back.

It is currently trading at Book Value (finviz, feel free to correct me on this), and is in the process of successfully deleveraging it's debt (rising stock prices would help with this process creating a virtuous cycle). Throw in its forward P/E of 7.36 and it looks very cheap in this most irrational of markets.

With NatGas prices charging higher we can expect to see a nice upswing in Commstock's beaten-down share price, as investors continue their rotation away from massively overvalued assets (TSLA, CryptCurrencies, etc) into deep value plays.

After the decimation of the US oil industry last year, CRK is also profiting nicely from their oil reserves. And with OPEC constantly pushing for higher prices, this will continue for the foreseeable future.

Short interest is currently at around 20% (finviz short number x 2, which seems to be correct). Options IV is under 40%. This is one of the last true value plays in the Energy Sector. The timing is right, come get some!

Their industry is projected to grow 30% every year for the next 10 years. So it's a good long term bet. It's also a good short term bet because it gets really nice big spikes. I'm in this position. Exits for me are laid out in the chart. Assuming I reach a TP I will exit part of the position and then when it cools off for another month or two I will enter again when the technical setup looks good. I plan on doing this a couple times a year for a few years if this pattern keeps up.

# TA Notes: 

* Bulls broke the small 419.64 test that was listed in prior posts. Found support until SPY tested 20 SMMA . We got a nice green candle after close 👀.
* However, SPY still could not break 421.

# TA Notes:

Theta has caused a rinse and repeat of targets the last three days.

* if 420.73 breaks, look for bullish 🎯 : 422.43 - 423.81 - 425.15
* If 417.25 breaks, look for bearish 🎯 : 416 - 415 - 414.13 - 412.74 - 411.26 - 410
* Please not that if we push below 415 we could see downwards pressure to 405.
* **Best case for bulls is that we gap above 421 tomorrow.**
* **Best case for bears is we gap below to fill small gap @ 419 and test new resistance.**

Trade knowledge for knowledge or something, we'll figure it out. My family is going to be homeless on Sunday. My dad is in a coma and his work is fucking him out of his retirement money. The city bought the place we were living and are kicking us out to the street. The USPS won't let us get our mail and are returning it all back to sender. Shelters are full of the 100k+ prisoners California released because of covid. People who are convicted child rapists, people involved in theft rings, people who go around shooting other random people just because. This last week alone 3 people, including a 6yr old kid, were shot and killed while in a car on the freeway! Its getting worse rapidly. Each one of us is medically jacked up in some form and even when we tried to get a job recently as things have been opening up, we are turned away because we don't have an address, don't seem reliable because how much is going on, and we don't have everything they want. We've been living in poverty our whole lives and I dont want to see my parents suffer anymore. My dad's worked for the same place for 35 years and when he went into his coma, they basically stole his retirement. My moms had a heart attack and has 8 stints and now sleeps alone without her husband after 30 years next to each other. The long term care facilities that my dads been to have been mistreating him. They've dropped him on his face, he's had infections, rashes, and sores they couldn't explain (except the bed sores he has), and he even ended up with a UTI. Thats absolutely unacceptable. My dad's sacrificed everything he ever had and always chose others over himself and this is how he gets thanked? We've been trying every day to make a better life and get anywhere to live and every day some agency or organization steps in and shits all over it. Its pushed me to the point where I'm only living to make sure my dad gets taken care of. I've sold everything I have just to make it this far. I dont understand the market or how to get started and I dont have any money to invest. I found all my pokemon card collections going back to at least 98 but I dont have the time to sell them or wait for them to get graded. My dad is laying on a cold hospital bed able to hear everything but unable to see or move. Imagine being in that situation. I love my dad and I never got to spend a lot of time with him and the morning he had his asthmatic episode, we all did what we could to keep him alive. He ended up dying on my shoulders and with the help of a stranger, my brother, and the paramedics, we got a heartbeat after 5 minutes. The system is not helping us, the city state and government assistance programs refuse to help, and we're 2 days away from living on the street. Im not asking for free shit, im asking to barter your skills for my skills or time once I can secure somewhere to live. This is no fake b.s. and im not a prince from Zimbabwe. Im from a shithole town in Southern California full of fucked up people. I just want to see my family smile for once..",,

Alright retards listen up this is a huge play that keeps getting auto-modded out because of market cap but it's on fire, still cheap, and institutional and HFs are buying it on value.

Stock has been beaten down, with a current market cap under 200mm, despite the fact that they will have 60mm in net after-tax cash on hand at the end of the year. They also have a state of the art manufacturing plant built in 2010 for 400mm, which is finally operating at a profit.

And as of Q1 this year, their Cash on hand was greater than their outstanding debt. The balance sheet is shaping up beautifully. 

Retard math:

400mm plant built in 2010, say it could be liquidated for 200mm

60mm in guaranteed govt incentive a/t cash flow left in 2021

At least 10mm ebitda in 2022 from newly signed CABOT deal

Newly acquired water purification segment saw positive ebitda for the first time, about $2mm

$200mm + $60mm + $10mm + 2mm / 19mm shares

=

$14.31 in liquidation value based on immediate financials. No debt.

Why is this stock only 8 dollars?

It was picked up in VIC last week and the stock has been running ever since. Cool to see one of my ideas picked up by real time traders!

So tomorrow? I'M GONNA GET ADES",,

It's fine that you can't afford to buy all 50 contracts back because in the same trade you're selling 50 new contracts for an overall credit (preferably). 

In Robinhood go to AMCs options and set your settings to buy calls, then go to your contract and just long press on it (in the menu with all the contracts) and you'll see little boxes pop up next to all the options in the chain, and your may 28th 19c will have a little check in it's box. Now switch the settings to sell calls, and change the expiration to any date past your call, and then you can just tap any contract and then you'll see the order menu at the bottom change from ""Long Call"" to ""2-Option order"", hit it and roll that motherfucker.

Also it's preferable to sell calls for more than you brought your calls back for, so you overall earn a credit.",,

Yes, 500k sounds overly excessive. Yet, the point is that there’s increased short interest against AMC again, and today’s share ride actually increased the amount of shorts despite now crazy high loan fees.

The idea of people holding on to AMC for better or worse is this (in a nutshell):

a) not many big whale‘s are left holding AMC, they nearly all cashed out at this point. The 3.5 Million individual share holders are mostly “retail investors”, and they are not as quick to cash in. A big majority is waiting for the stock to go WAY higher (as in ballistic) before even thinking of selling based on the group thinking (which happens on other subreddits). People are calling to wait for truly life-changing money. A lot of the small investors are still doubling down by buying more.

b) if the stock price keeps increasing at this rate, the banks will start asking hedgies and other shorters for increasing risk coverage on outstanding shorts, which will result in the first Margin calls. That will mean some of those shorters need to cover by buying real shares. With not much float out there, that will drive the price way up, which will result in more Margin calls. Do that cycle a couple of times, and you have calls on all shorts… which means they’ll buy whatever they can get at any price, at least that’s the theory. When that first big amount of calls might start, there’s several different opinions I’ve seen amongst the more savvy redditors. Some say as soon as $30 (we got briefly close to  that today), others $50, $80, $100.

Make up your own mind. I’m personally enjoying the current ride. I love green numbers in my accounts.

TLDR, its possible.

Long answer:

There is a pretty serious theory - arguably it is actually just a fact not a theory - that due to the fact that more shares have been shorted than exist - the stocks can be sent into an infinite loop short squeeze.

This got very very serious with GME in particular a couple months ago.

The trouble is that this will bankrupt the people who run the entire financial system.

But the infinite loop never triggered, instead the market makers stepped in and halted buy trading, but allowed sell trading on like 1/4 of all trading platforms.

Some folks in suits went on record in some federal hearings and confirmed that most people don't realize the market almost collapsed.

AMC could go to $1000. 

If it does, it will bring the whole fucking stock market down.
