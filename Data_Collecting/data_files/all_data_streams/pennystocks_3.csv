Initiating coverage of **AIkido Pharma Inc. (NASDAQ: AIKI)**, biotechnology development company, focused on small-molecule anti-cancer therapeutics and an antiviral platform.  
 

Current price                   $1.06/share  
Outstanding (est.)           89.3M shares  
Float (est.)                        82.4M shares  
52-week range                $.47 to $2.55/share  
Cash per share (est.)      $1.15 (3-31-21)  
AIKI has no debt.  
 

We noticed some new developments at AIKI and thought these potential catalysts could lead to a near term gain. We were not the only ones as the company’s value increased 15% over Monday and Tuesday’s sessions this week. With a 52-week high of $2.55/share, we expect AIKI shares may experience a further near-term gain.  
 

It’s been a year since we last reported to you on AIKI. Since then, the company has made significant progress in product development and the current market price seems to be a value. **Five recent developments** **caught our attention and prompted this new report:**  
 

* The company had a cash and equivalents balance of $102 million or approximately $1.15 per share as of March 31st.
* CEO Anthony Hayes made three purchases of the company shares over the past 30 days, totaling 30,000 shares at the market price. The purchases increased Mr. Hayes holdings of AIKI shares by 60%.
* As per the company 10-Q for Q121, just filed on May 10th, the company has a book value of $1.17 per share.
* A key milestone, with testing data publication and technology advancement results, is expected this quarter. There are only a few weeks left in this quarter.
* AIKI shares are trading 64% off their February 16th high of $2.55/share.

A look at the [company stock chart](https://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=AIKI) indicates an RSI (14) value of 43.31 and a share price that has fallen below its 50 DMA of $1.06/share and 200 DMA of $.91/share. These data can indicate shares that have been oversold.  
 

AIKI is developing its drug pipeline through partnerships with educational institutions, including the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Maryland, Baltimore, and Wake Forest University. The company’s oncology therapeutics include prospective treatments for pancreatic cancer, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).  
 

The Company is also developing a broad-spectrum antiviral platform, in which the lead compounds have activity in cell-based assays against multiple viruses including Influenza virus, Ebolavirus and Marburg virus, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19.  
 

**AIKI has a book and a cash value position that both exceed the company’s market value.**  
 

The fact that the AIKI CEO recently bought 30,000 shares at the market with his own funds can be quite telling. What does he know that we don’t? Everything.  
 

Additional information about the company pipeline is available in this [company presentation](https://ir.aikidopharma.com/assets/uploads/2021/05/2021-04-29-Pitchdeck-Aikido-Pharma.pdf) and could be of value in your due diligence process.  
 

Stay tuned for more on AIKI,

Good day everyone,  
 

Aikido Pharma (AIKI) Has $100M in Cash, Where Might That Pile of Money Take Them?  
 

We are continuing our coverage of AIkido Pharma Inc. (NASDAQ: AIKI)  
 

Current price                   $1.07/share  
 

This morning, [the company released significant news](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aikido-pharma-announces-phase-1-131500189.html). **Phase 1 testing data will be presented at the 2021 ASCO Annual Meeting June 4, 2021.** The Phase I study is of the company product 225Ac-J591 for men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  
 

Part of the presentation description states ""PSMA-targeted alpha-emitter 225Ac utilizing intact antibody J591 is tolerable with early evidence of clinical activity. Based upon these results, a follow up study \[NCT04506567\] testing multiple and fractionated dosing of 225Ac-J591 is underway.”  
 

Moving into a next level clinical trial is a big development for any biopharma company and can act as a catalyst for the company’s value. Biopharma companies are built on these kinds of milestones.  
 

In February, AIKI raised $75M in a share offering, a move that built the $100M pile of cash they are sitting on. **Those shares were sold at $1.60**, considerably higher than today’s price.  
 

What could the next move be for a company valued at $95M with a cash position at $100M?  
 

1. AIKI could plow that cash into development of their pipeline. The addition of Dr. Matthew Frieman, a world-renowned virologist with expertise in coronaviruses to the AIKI Scientific Advisory Board last month indicates company interest in developing their anti-viral program. The news today indicates a move to a next level clinical trial.
2. AIKI could seek an acquisition that would either compliment the development of their current pipeline or bring products to add to it.
3. AIKI could be a party to a reverse merger. Many larger biopharma companies would likely salivate over a $100M pile of cash. A reverse merger, funded by an acquirer’s shares, could give another company access to all that cash. The question is, what value in shares would another company give up to get all that cash backing them?

These scenarios are all conjecture, of course, yet all are possibilities. Suddenly, AIKI is being talked about in the biopharma circles. The consistent flow of company developments and the big cash position have created a real buzz about AIKI.  
 

Stay tuned and stay informed,

The rest of the sentence and quote are here:

""During the nine months ended March 31, 2021, the Company incurred $31,837,067 of operating expenses compared to $4,493,703 of operating expenses during the nine months ended March 31, 2020. Overall, the increase in operating expense was due to the fact that the Company issued 33,650,036 common shares and 200,000 Series A preferred shares for consulting services with a fair value of $27,072,162""

“during the nine months ended March 31, 2021, compared to the issuance of 26,446,200 common shares with a fair value of $1,613,468 for consulting services during the nine months ended March 31, 2020. Of the remaining operating expenses not related to share-based compensation of $4,764,905, the expenditures were higher than the prior period amount of $2,880,235 due to an increase in general and administrative expense as the overall level of day-to-day operating costs increased including increases in payroll and benefits expense as the Company required more staffing compared to prior year.”


It looks like they issued 6MM more shares than the same period a year ago.  They used $4.7MM as share based compensation. 

The share price went from $0.07 to somewhere over $2 in that period.

207,,2021-05-20 15:31:49,t3_nh39sa,,pennystocks,"As most of you probably know, Agenus (AGEN), recently signed a licensing agreement with Bristol Myers Squibb. And since then, there stock has been shooting up. Focused primarily on cancer-related immunotherapy but having also been involved with Covid-19 vaccines, Agenus went public in 2000, debuting at 368 a share. Before the year was over, they were down to 65. By January, 2009, they'd reached 2.16  In 2018, their stock shot up when they partnered with Gilead and reached highs of 5.84 from a prior hovering around the low 4 dollar range, but it proved to be a temporary boost.

Now, with this recent licensing agreement, positive attention has once again turned towards AGEN. Will this be a repeat of it's prior history, a temporary boost that isn't going to last, or are things going to be different this time? Immunotherapy is a burgeoning field that has given many cancer patients and their families a since of hope and it has received some positive press when it seemed to work for Jimmy Carter (my father attempted immunotherapy and in his case, it was unfortunately not successful). They are the only American producer of [triterpene glycoside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triterpene_glycoside), which is a crucial element in Astrozeneca and the Novavax Covid-19 vaccine. So the company certainly fulfills an important niche and in many ways, seems primed to enter into a prominent place in the medical landscape.

At the same time, as we've seen with Pfizer or even with Zomedica, the medical field is complicated and simply because you provide an important or even ubiquitous product does not necessarily mean a financial windfall as far as your stock might be concerned. There's no denying AGEN is hot right now, but how long is it going to last? Does history repeat itself, or is this the breakthrough Agenus--and it's shareholders--have been waiting for?",nh39sa,AGEN has been going up; how far will it go?

**Phase 1 testing data will be presented at the** **2021 ASCO Annual Meeting June 4, 2021**

**We can extrapolate the Phase 1 data to be presented will be a near-term catalyst in the next few weeks.**

Good day everyone,

Aikido Pharma (AIKI) Has $100M in Cash, Where Might That Pile of Money Take Them?

We are continuing our coverage of AIkido Pharma Inc. (NASDAQ: AIKI)

Current price                   $1.07/share

This morning, [the company released significant news](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aikido-pharma-announces-phase-1-131500189.html). **Phase 1 testing data will be presented at the 2021 ASCO Annual Meeting June 4, 2021.** The Phase I study is of the company product 225Ac-J591 for men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).

Part of the presentation description states ""PSMA-targeted alpha-emitter 225Ac utilizing intact antibody J591 is tolerable with early evidence of clinical activity. Based upon these results, a follow up study \[NCT04506567\] testing multiple and fractionated dosing of 225Ac-J591 is underway.”

Moving into a next level clinical trial is a big development for any biopharma company and can act as a catalyst for the company’s value. Biopharma companies are built on these kinds of milestones.

In February, AIKI raised $75M in a share offering, a move that built the $100M pile of cash they are sitting on. **Those shares were sold at $1.60**, considerably higher than today’s price.

What could the next move be for a company valued at $95M with a cash position at $100M?

1. AIKI could plow that cash into development of their pipeline. The addition of Dr. Matthew Frieman, a world-renowned virologist with expertise in coronaviruses to the AIKI Scientific Advisory Board last month indicates company interest in developing their anti-viral program. The news today indicates a move to a next level clinical trial.
2. AIKI could seek an acquisition that would either compliment the development of their current pipeline or bring products to add to it.
3. AIKI could be a party to a reverse merger. Many larger biopharma companies would likely salivate over a $100M pile of cash. A reverse merger, funded by an acquirer’s shares, could give another company access to all that cash. The question is, what value in shares would another company give up to get all that cash backing them?

These scenarios are all conjecture, of course, yet all are possibilities. Suddenly, AIKI is being talked about in the biopharma circles. The consistent flow of company developments and the big cash position have created a real buzz about AIKI.",nh3arv,"Low float just crossed the 20 and 50 DMA near-term catalyst w/100M in cash, only $1.06/sh"

They save the healthcare system 100s of millions . 
They price their eye injections for 20 dollars or so. Very cheap
They save the patients the requirement of taking multiple eye drops costing 1,000s and the inconvenience of taking it multiple times per day.

They have over 5 spin-off companies which they own 20-40 percent stake in. One is eton trading in the nasdaq.

Revenue  consistent increasing 30 percent year over year . Right now their annual revenue is about 60 million with 40 percent margins . They are on track to 100 million in 2022. 

They are going for fda approvals now on some of their eye products such as their compounded eye drops and eye injections . Which already have a proof of concept with over ten thousand procedures . If they get one fda approval , the price of the product will be multiplied by ten times at least . I can see Their revenue multiply ten times over. 

The market cap on this stock is 250 million . 
I mean they have 50 million dollars sitting  in stock in just one of their spinoff company iPos. They have 20 million cash for their fda approval pipeline.

One of their other spinoff companies is mko melt. First oral anesthesia for office procedures like eye surgeries or dental surgeries etc. it’s ok the market now as compounded drug .

Hrow should be trading now at 25 dollars. 

Market cap is low, revenue and margins are profitable , and the reason they are not trading that high is becuaee the market does not like non fda approved drugs .

Link to COO’s Twitter post about this: https://twitter.com/drgauravchandra/status/1393198101683376128?s=21

Website: http://enzolytics.com/

So, I don’t think there’s any official announcement of Intel and Enzolytics partnering; however, the fact that Intel has publicly posted this Whitepaper highlighting how their AI technology works well with ENZC’s treatments, science, and team could hint towards something big in the works. 

For more justification of Intel supporting Enzolytics and their team, check out this link to the COO’s LinkedIn activity where two Intel representatives commented: 

Nikhil Deshpande, Ph.D. and Clifton Roberts.

I’m surprised to not see any news about this on here. 

Intel + Enzolytics Whitepaper: https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/central-libraries/us/en/documents/optimizing-empathetic-ai-to-cure-deadly-diseases1.pdf

Gaurav Chandra is the COO, and he’s active on Twitter— check out his page to see where I’m getting part of this information from! 

Website: http://enzolytics.com/

So, I don’t think there’s any official announcement of Intel and Enzolytics partnering; however, the fact that Intel has publicly posted this Whitepaper highlighting how their AI technology works well with ENZC’s treatments, science, and team could hint towards something big in the works. 

For more justification of Intel supporting Enzolytics and their team, check out this link to the COO’s LinkedIn activity where two Intel representatives commented: 

Nikhil Deshpande, Ph.D. and Clifton Roberts.

I'm getting ahead of the curve by answering things I know will be mentioned.

1. 100k isn't a huge amount this isn't that significant.

Answer : It's 6% his total ownership and going into phase III would you invest ANY money if you weren't confident in what you were doing.


2. I have these weird rashes on my balls.

Answer: Baby powder and penicillin.


I suggest reading this too, it's doing great. Phase III with a strong buy rating as well as a 3.33 avg PT.

Great read from International Business Times. Talks at how small player Tryp Therapeutics is trying to potentially mirror the success of cannabis companies like GW Pharmaceuticals, as the shroom boom is looking to follow the weed boom.

The success of cannabis has been huge! GW Pharmaceuticals was actually recently purchased by Jazz Pharmaceuticals for $7.2 billion. Not to mention its stock growth, initially trading at $8.90 and now at over $215 a share!

TRYP Therapeutics is one of the industry’s growth leaders within the psychedelic sector that many predict is following in the footsteps of GW, positioned to mirror its success.

The article can be seen below but these are the main reasons they vouch for Tryp's success:

* They are trying to break the stigma surrounding psychedelic treatments
* They are expanding their pipeline to include many different treatments from competitors
* Extensive Experience in Big Pharma
* Targetting more rare disorders that have a high demand for treatment

Looking at the 6 month chart, we are coming out of a consolidation period as seen by the Head and Shoulders Continuation pattern. Here is the explanation from binary options.net .... Enjoy and don't forget, taxes are cheaper in a 401 or Roth!

Head and Shoulders Continuation Pattern

The continuation version looks very similar to the normal reversal head and shoulders, accept there are a few distinct differences:

Continuation patterns occur after a sharp up (or run down). When looked at from a broad perspective, this makes the head and shoulders look more like a consolidation than a reversal pattern.

The head and shoulders should also be about half the size (or less) of the sharp price run that preceded it. This isn’t an exact measurement, but it should look like a consolidation after a run up, therefore, it can’t cover as much distance as the price run before the pattern.

If a potential continuation pattern occurs in an uptrend, the lows of the continuation should reach pretty close to the same level. If the last low is higher than the others, that is fine. If the price breaks significantly below the low point of the pattern, then it is likely a reversal instead.

If a potential continuation pattern occurs in a downtrend, the highs of the continuation pattern should reach pretty close to the same level. If the last high is lower the others, that is fine.

If it is a continuation pattern, the expectation is for the trend to resume following the pattern.""",nh7eb7,$CELZ to Revive it's Uptrend!!! (From current levels)

I'm not here to fluff this company, more to ask for others' insights into what I might be missing. 

They have rights to a silver mine in Mexico that has had excellent results:

And they have large leases on great ground in a proven resource area for potash and lithium:

 [New Tech Minerals Provides Update on Key Leases in the Paradox Basin, Utah](https://newtechminerals.ca/news-releases/2021/new-tech-minerals-provides-update-on-key-leases-in-the-paradox-basin-utah/)

In my DD of any other company in this space, New Tech Minerals should be at $0.20-$0.40, at least. Yet here it is a 4 and a half cents. Before I do something dumb (like buy 10%of the company lol), what am I missing? Even their management is names I have heard before, and seen in successful companies:

559,,2021-05-20 19:42:42,t3_nh9isb,,pennystocks,"I know that nobody liked my previous theory about [Shipit.to](https://Shipit.to) and Amazon, but this time I think it's a legit find that puts us all ahead of the news. 

# Basics first for those who see it for the first time 

Xigem Technologies - $XIGM on CSE and $2C1 on FSE - is a Canadian company, a technology provider for the remote economy. They have a patented app iAgent (CRM and remote business operations) in development and 5 LOIs with future clients. They also signed an agreement to acquire a P2P payment system FOOi last week, completely. And signed a LOI to acquire 21% of a shipping tracker company [Shipit.to](https://Shipit.to) in April - which is the subject of this post. 

# To the best part now

No new press releases to link, so check out this old one:

[https://www.xigemtechnologies.com/xigem-technologies-announces-strategic-investment-in-logistics-technology-provider-shipit-to/](https://www.xigemtechnologies.com/xigem-technologies-announces-strategic-investment-in-logistics-technology-provider-shipit-to/) 

**Xigem Technologies Announces Strategic Investment in Logistics Technology Provider** [**Shipit.to**](https://Shipit.to)

# Two things to highlight: 

1. Check the date - April 20, 2021
2. Check the last paragraph (the one that nobody reads because it's always a disclaimer of some sort). The quote: 

>Pursuant to the LOI, the Company (Xigem) will acquire a 21% interest in Shipit.to in exchange for US$200,000 in cash and US$863,291 in common shares of Xigem. In addition, the Company will appoint a representative to the Shipit.to Board of Directors. **The transaction is expected to be completed within the next thirty days**, subject to the execution of definitive agreements and the receipt of any regulatory approvals.

**The ""next thirty days"" end today.** It's May 20, if I'm not out of my mind. 

If it's real, they should publish the press release soon. Today, so late? Doubt it. Tomorrow seems to be more likely. Or on Monday. 

It doesn't matter, because **you've got to look at the chart on April 20:** 

https://preview.redd.it/epjwrn5lpb071.png?width=929&format=png&auto=webp&s=6861ebee535c35306c750a7d3a32b3689356a62f

Sorry for the graph quality but you see **the main point:** 

**Just a LOI with** [**Shipit.to**](https://Shipit.to) **sent it from 0,2 to 0,7. And now they have to close the deal in the upcoming days.** 

Of course there was also an Advisory board establishment on April 22, but the LOI - a forward-looking statement - started the way to 0,7. No other news were published until April 22, and no news were published before (from April 14 to April 20). 

**Mandatory reality check:** I'm not a financial advisor, and even worse - I understand that I might be a bit too excited to trade rationally now. No guarantees it will really happen. No guarantees it will triple the stock again. Maybe less, maybe more. I'll get a cold shower before loading my bags before the closing. If you have any ideas why I can be wrong, please tell me.  

# Short version

When Xigem Technologies announced a forward-looking LOI on agreement with [Shipit.to](https://Shipit.to) on April 20, the stock nearly tripled. **Today** (May 20) is the deadline for this exact deal to turn from a forward-looking statement, a promise, into a real transaction and a real part of their portfolio. I think they will not announce it today, but will keep it till tomorrow or Monday. I think it's the end of the discount, so I decided to bring it here as a theory before the news - if there will be any - will make it to the public.",nh9isb,$XIGM and Shipit LOI deadline - Today. Closing of the agreement that tripled the stock might be coming - THEORY

Gold and silver have always managed to pass the test of time no matter the obstacle, this financial cycle / downturn is no different. If you want to protect your wealth or grow it while most things go red, consider either buying physical or a junior mining company like St. James Gold.

Just today St. James received their permit to begin both surface work and drilling at their new Quinn Lake Project over in Newfoundland. The project is adjacent and even contiguous with the Valentine Gold Project helmed by another company that recent discoveries indicated 3.14M OZ of gold at 1.36 g/t and another 1M OZ of gold at 1.7 g/t were inferred.

The company that owns a project beside theirs, has a market cap of over $500 million. St. James runs at a cool $74M, this is a great undervalued asset to own before the share price really takes off.

This news is great for their Quinn project, but that's only one of three they own. They also own the Florin Gold Project in the Yukon, and the Grub Line Property also in Newfoundland. Both of these projects also have amazing prospects in their own rights. Most of these properties are 100% owned, so that will translate to 100% profit :)

While the company is pre-revenue, there is no long-term debt so there are no creditors that are owed before the shareholders.The 52-week range goes from 0.06 to 6.5, that's over 100x increase, incredible!! Just in the last 6 months the SP has gone from 0.15 to a current 4.7, that's more than 30x.

There was a recent dip that seems like a great place to get in before it starts soaring again. Future drilling permits and production till be in the near future so I wouldn't want to miss on this if I were you.

Stay safe, this is not financial advice!!",nhaa2e,"St. James Gold Corp, Just Got Their Permit to Drill. Super Undervalued Junior Mining Company Here. Great SP Returns YTD"

I want to spread the word about Liberty Defense. They have outrageous amounts of backing from big names, a fantastic line of in-development products, and are extremely undervalued. If you were looking for an under-the-radar market gem, look no further!

Liberty defense is hard at work at becoming one of the big names in security. They are in the development of several products that aim to make people safer and make security as a whole a much more efficient process. They plan to do this by implementing some super-advanced 3D imaging and AI technology. This is way more useful than your average metal detector and is truly amazing technology.

Two of their projects are the High Definition - Advanced Imaging Technology (HD-AIT) and their Shoe Scanner. This tech uses imaging tech to identify foreign objects on an individual without the need for the removal of coats, jackets, or shoes. Can you imagine this being used at airports to make security checkpoints so much faster! Well, it may be coming as these projects have received funding from the DHS to develop these with the intention that they will eventually be used by the TSA.

On top of these great products, their big showstopper is their venue security system HEXWAVE. While it looks like a traditional metal detector it is so much more. It also uses 3D Imaging and AI to be able to identify threats on a person in real-time. It will flag items even if their non-metal and some of the things it can identify are handguns, rifles, IED’s and flares. One HEXWAVE device can scan 1000 people an hour! These things could be put at sporting events, concerts, schools, government buildings, you name it!

HEXWAVE is currently in Beta testing with a bunch of participating groups. For any soccer fans out there, Bayern Munich is a part of this group and is using them along with 9 others. With a planned launch in 2022, now seems like the perfect time to get in on Liberty.

Post-Covid and even now as things start to open up, these are going to be a hot commodity. You can get in on Liberty for half a dollar, and I feel like the only way it can go is UP with its releases coming next year!

672,,2021-05-20 21:05:01,t3_nhbhb3,,pennystocks,"Here’s why $PSRU might sky-rocket in the coming days:

&#x200B;

Catalysts, etc: NBA playoffs, Juneteenth, severely beaten up share-price due to covid (covid restrictions now lifting)

&#x200B;

Let’s look at last June first.  In June 2020, we saw a lot of companies with African-American CEOs put out news around Juneteenth.  As a result, many of those companies saw a skyrocketing of share prices ($UONE, $UONEK, $BYFC, $AMS, $RLJ, $LMFA, etc).  You might be thinking, ‘Did the rockets stay on the moon or come crashing back down to earth (namely: was it a pump and dump)?  You may be surprised to know that while the share prices for many of those didn’t stay on the moon, they also didn’t return to earth either.  UONE was perhaps the biggest rocket.  It was $2 in May 2020, then skyrocketed to over $36 in June.  Then it came back down, but not all of the way.  It was $6 earlier this week.  And what happened today?... UONE was $6.01 this morning and closed up $3.55 to $9.56.

&#x200B;

So, it seems that we are seeing these same stocks starting to spike again in anticipation of more June news this year.  

&#x200B;

Both $PSRU and $RLJ haven’t yet seen the spikes that the others have, so they may be next.

&#x200B;

Okay, so we might see a spike in PSRU because of possible June news, but what might that news be?

&#x200B;

PSRU has a lot going for it:

First, they have television shows on a number of platforms (Roku, apple tv, etc), and they are working on a direct app.

&#x200B;

Second, they are also bringing the ABA to Canada.  The NBA and ABA were competing basketball leagues in the past (Dr. J played in the ABA), and then they merged.  PSRU hopes to have celebrity owners of each team.  They also have a team in Hollywood and one in Beverly Hills.

&#x200B;

With the NBA playoffs at hand, June seems like a logical PR time for the ABA anyway, and Juneteenth seems to make it even more likely.

&#x200B;

PSRU has connections already in Hollywood due to their work in tv.  And they have connections in basketball (including having worked with Kobe Bryant’s dad).  They also have some endorsements on youtube from Cedric the Entertainer, Lavar Ball, and Paula Abdul (former Laker girl).  And some other actors as well.

&#x200B;

The share price has been really beaten up in the past year due to covid and a resulting dilution, but with a share price under .01, it could rocket significantly.  Especially with covid restrictions lifting.

&#x200B;

2 days ago on twitter PSRU posted: “Dear Valiant Eagle, Inc. (OTC: PSRU) Shareholders, Our quarterly report reflects the significant debt that we have shed.  Significant updates will be coming.”

&#x200B;

This is not financial advice.  Please do your own DD to see if this is right for you.  I know that there will always be people skeptical of penny stocks, and that’s okay if it’s not for you (and if that’s the case, then good luck in your other investments).  I posted about another sub-penny stock in January, and someone replied “Wow I rather burn my money”.  That stock then went from sub-penny to 7 cents (and is 3 cents today).  Everyone has a different risk tolerance, and that's okay too.

&#x200B;

TLDR: PSRU (Valiant Eagle) is less than 1 cent.  On Sept 30, 2020, it spiked from 1.5 cents to over 10 cents on their ABA announcement.  NBA playoffs now.  Juneteenth soon.",nhbhb3,"$PSRU (Valiant Eagle)- under 1 cent and ready to fly (ABA Basketball, tv, music, etc)"

For those that noticed 5/17 saw a mad (seriously bananas) amount of insider buying of $ELOX. Close to 11million shares picked up by BoD members. It has been hovering at $1.39, and didn't drop at the closing of the public offering, so it looks like it is at a bottom.

Low float, only 27mil, though the volume has been insane and the price hasnt moved much in the last couple of days, I am guessing because someone is shorting? (someone correct me if i am reading that wrong). 

Since the initial load up, additional BoD members have exercised their options to load up on more, they obviously feel pretty good about whatever is about to happen.

This is a highly speculative play obviously, a beaten down biotech trading on pennies of its former price, but massive (MASSIVE) insider loading as they are completing a phase 2 clinical trial...but someone is holding it down somehow too and I'm sure that can go on for a while...anyway. This feels like a really exciting opportunity, but I am less interested in pumping it and more interested in learning more about the play from anyone smarter about this stuff than I am (which is probably almost anyone)",nhbjt4,$ELOX insiders still buying in mass

1. Court hearing date discharge of custodianship (date TBD)
2. Cancellation of at least 1 billion shares
3. The official merger announcement (all signs point to real estate company Gold Quest Group $$$$)
4. Ticker change

Select members of this subreddit have enthusiastically shared this play in the past, but this will likely get passed over again for the usual popular February stocks. And that’s too bad, because realistic price targets range from $.20 to a $1.00. With the $AVVH currently just over $.03, this is potentially a x10 bagger.

Oh, and don’t ignore SSM Monopoly’s robust pipeline of other custodianship plays, including $FBCD (the next big mover), $IFAN, $MDCE, $CBYI, $GMZP, and the contested one $MNVN. Many will flow $AVVH’s path.

""A panel of Richmond officials has selected Urban One's casino project in South Richmond, concluding a months-long evaluation of various casino development plans the city requested.  
While Richmond voters will decide whether to permit the project in a referendum on Nov. 2, pending City Council approval, the evaluation panel's decision means that the city is no longer considering plans for a casino on Arthur Ashe Boulevard where the Bowtie movie theater currently stands.  
Administration officials in a release said Mayor Levar Stoney will introduce plans to the City Council on Monday to partner with Urban One, a Washington-based media conglomerate, to build a casino on property currently owned by Philip Morris USA near the intersection of Commerce Road and Walmsley Boulevard.  
“The project will create over 1,000 good paying jobs, generate a significant amount of new revenue for the city, and establish an additional economic engine in South Richmond,"" Stoney said.  
The release says the evaluation panel recommended the Urban One project based on the project' ""feasibility and sustainability, proposed location, economic development impact, financial revenue impact, and community benefits.""  
Urban One's projections predict the casino project will generate $525 million in new tax revenue and other benefits for the city over the next decade. The company also says it is committed to a $15 minimum wage for its employees, who is says will make an average of $55,000 annually....""",,

748,,2021-05-20 21:50:21,t3_nhcjpt,,pennystocks,"Hello community,

Background- I have been a small cap (not OTC) trader for the better part of 3-4 years, recently getting profitable 6 months before the COVID crash- and having a record year (for me) during the ensuing post crash growth.  After the a 75%+ recovery from the SP and NASDAQ i wanted to venture into an area that offered continued volatility- enter penny stocks. 

GNCP-  GNCC Capital, Inc. has interests in Gold & Silver Mining Exploration Properties, namely: ""White Hills"", ""Yarber Wash"", ""McCracken"" and ""Pearl Spring"". The Company is now expanding into specific financial services through targeted acquisitions and in order to generate Revenues and cash flow to commence diversifying the Company from just that of Mining Exploration. Premier Development & Investment, Inc. (OTC: PDIV) holds the largest position of GNCC Capital, Inc. Voting shares of Common Stock. 

The GOOD- 

\-Recently ""reworked"" their profile (company description) with an emphasis on adapting to the changing environment to increase company value- while changing company direction would seem like a lot of work for the company, its small employee size (3 ) allows for superior adaptability, mobility and flexibility.

\-New PR- a definitive improvement from their previous random tweets- The PR over the last few weeks has been professional for a sub penny stock to say the least. The new PR team understands proper release times and the importance for getting their ducks in a row (ex. getting Pink PRIOR to big PR release)

\-Pink Status- most big money investors wont touch a stock without them being up to date financially (things you guys know). While the stock hasn't broke out since its PINK announcement- I believe most are waiting for the pending After hours PR (today 20MAY2021). 

\-Minimal exposure- Lack of DD, as well as ""THE BAD"" has left this stock under traded IMO and has let those who are willing to take the RISK/REWARD ratio a chance to accumulate over the last months. 

The BAD-

\-Large quantity of O/S, while the company has publicly stated that dilution has not occurred, the stock has not had an amazing breakout that would allow them to capitalize on this yet.   

\- Failed PR timelines- While the PR has been professional- the lack of pulling the trigger because they are waiting for the ""perfect PR situation"" has led them to delay updates and PR even after committing to a schedule 

&#x200B;

Closing thoughts-  Most of us are waiting on an EEENF breakout situation to invest serious capital on a ticker- and while the O/S are cause for concern.  The company's recent  progress is something i have been watching patiently.  I think if the SP grows and dilution is not present- the company could be a diamond in the rough.  Please if you have anything to add please do- I have utilized this page for some of my best trades to date and find that some of the best nuggets of information come from ""polesmoker69-420""- esk goons that have insight I do not. \*\* I'm not a financial advisor- I eat glue and don't have a job.\*\*",nhcjpt,GNCP- A realistic viewpoint

Not sure if the short report is valid, but will say in life where there is smoke there is usually fire.  I have asked several times on this board WHY humble/ TSNP (prior) NEVER files a SEC 8k?  They literally RM, changed symbols, and RS all without ONE single 8k filed.  I realize OTC doesn't have to report, but a company like Humbl who say they want to be BIGGER then Paypal would most likely file 8ks like MANY companies even in the OTC/ penny stock world jus to show they cross their T's and dot their I's.

The MOST interesting is going to be the reaction from George Sharpe.  He seems like a guy who doesn't mind mind being aggressive with folks based on him snapping at SANP CEO.  If he responds with legal action then the report has some issues.  If he doesn't sue then there is likely  merit to the report.

Keep in mind LIBEL is illegal (knowingly spreading false information in print).  As far as I know NO ONE they have done a hit piece has sued, so I think these guys are accurate.  This is a situation where ""silence is deafening"".  Just my 2c.",,

The $1300 and crash you are seeing from the chart isn't Oncternal per se but GTx, the company that combined with ONCT in a reverse merger. GTx's pipeline was rife with failed clinical trials after the other. Look at each major drop in the chart and you will realize that they were a result of poor results not dilution. If you just look at their pipeline, they focused on SARMS, SERMS, and enobosarm, vastly different from ONCT's. GTx's management also did a very poor job and there are a bunch of other things that weren't going well for the company. 

Obviously dilution affects ONCT's stock price and in the two times they announced a bought offering, it went down by $1-2. As a result of that, they are well poised to fund their trials until 2023 and currently have no doubt in their balance sheet.",,

910,,2021-05-21 01:48:50,t3_nhh6pj,,pennystocks,"  Aikido Pharma (AIKI) Shares Have a Lot of Value Built in on Top of Near-Term Milestones Anticipated

**AIKI Market cap is a ridiculous $10M less than cash on hand!** 

**Just a move up to match the current book value of the company represents a 60% gain from the current PPS!!!**

Good day everyone, 

Continuing coverage of **AIkido Pharma Inc. (NASDAQ: AIKI**

Current price $1.09/share

AIKI shares showed resilience in Thursday’s session. The company shares closed at $1.07 in Wednesday’s session and closed yesterday at $1.09/share. After gaining 25% over the prior three sessions this week, some investors were inclined to take some profits and we congratulate them. 

We believe the 7M shares traded yesterday represented most of the profit taking and the shares showed some strength as eager buyers kept the price firm. We believe AIKI shares could give real benefit to current shareholders **as the stock approaches its book value of $1.73/share**. **We note a strong uptick in the last 30 minutes of Thursday’s session.**

**There are a few points from our reporting yesterday that we wanted to repeat:**

The company had a cash and equivalents balance of $102 million or approximately $1.22 per share as of the last quarterly report in March.

CEO Anthony Hayes made three purchases of the company shares over the past 30 days, totaling 30,000 shares at the market price. The purchases increased Mr. Hayes holdings of AIKI shares by 60%. The fact that the AIKI CEO recently bought 30,000 shares at the market with his own funds can be quite telling. What does he know that we don’t? Everything.

In February, AIKI raised $75M in a share offering, a move that built the $100M pile of cash they are sitting on. **Those shares were sold at $1.60**, considerably higher than today’s price.

**The AIKI pipeline:**

**DHA-dFdC (Gem-DHA)** for oral and/or IV cancer treatment licensed from University of Texas at Austin.

The global gemcitabine market expected to reach $900M by 2027. Gem-DHA drug patent recently issued and expires in 2035. AIKI is collaborating with Parimer Scientific in South Carolina to manufacture the drug to FDA quality.

**Synergistic dual drug radiotherapy** for prostate cancer from Weill Cornell Medical School.

The global prostate cancer treatment market size is projected to reach $9,904 million by 2026. In February of this year, AIKI purchased an ownership interest in Convergent Therapeutics, Inc., which has licensed rights to this technology. This treatment uses two radioactive molecules to target PSMA receptor on cancer cells.

Clinical studies status:

Phase 1, 2a Single Ascending Dose CONV 01- completed

Phase 1b/2a Multiple Ascending Dose CONV 01- ongoing

Convergent is currently planning additional advanced human trials:

Phase 1b/2a with the combination of CONV 01-α and PSMA I&T-β;

Phase 2b with the combination of PSMA I&T-β ± CONV 01-α, and

Phase 1b/2a with PSMA I&T-α ± CONV 01-α (both drugs with 225Ac, the α-particle emitter)

**Pan-Viral Drug Design** licensed from University of Maryland at Baltimore.

Preliminary proof of concept against coronavirus, flu, Ebola, and others. The global flu drug market alone is projected to reach $993.7M by 2026.

SKI complex ID’d as a potential broad-spectrum antiviral target

• Initial data suggested functional link between viral proteins and SKI

• Computer modeling ID’d potential drug binding pockets on SKI

• Computer modeling to design compounds to bind SKI pockets

• Screening ID’d specific compounds that inhibit various viruses

Silo Pharma - **Psylocybin Treatment** in Cancer Patients. 

Silo recently granted AIKI a worldwide exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-bearing license to four patent applications relating to delivering psilocybin directly to neuroinflamed tissue. Areas of potential use include treatment of cancer and symptoms caused by cancer, including but not limited to pain, nausea, neuroinflammation, brain and neural dysfunction, depression, seizures, confusion, dizziness, numbness/tingling, dysfunction of the senses and all other symptoms that are caused by cancer of any type.

**UK G4-1 for Solid Tumor Treatment**, University of Kentucky

• Effective against solid tumors, unlike competitors

Wake Forest’s **KPC34 for AML and ALL**

Leukemia (ALL)

• Small target patient populations: AML \~21K new/yr and ALL \~6K/yr:

• Eligible for Orphan Drug Designation, providing 7 years market exclusivity

• KPC34 also based on gemcitabine, like UT’s DHA-dFdC

AIKI has an impressive pipeline with the potential for development in both oncology and anti virals. With these potential products, each capable of eventual market success, and the cash to make that happen, AIKI looks to be ready for a potential run.",nhh6pj,"Updated Report, $AIKI started picking up steam towards EOD and in to AH"

People seem to be anticipating that a lot of news will be coming from these companies around Juneteenth again this year, and some of the company share prices have started to lift off already in anticipation of good PRs.  That includes PRs from outside companies pledging financial support of black-owned businesses.  I'm also looking at RLJ (not a penny) for the same reason. 

There are some predictable and cyclical patterns in stocks (like Amazon's share price always going up right after they release their Holiday sales numbers).  It seems like the companies listed above seem to release good PR in June (with a corresponding rise in share price).  UONE went from $2 to $36 last year, and then it settled at $6.  (So, someone starting at $2 ended at $6 if they never sold.  Not bad.)  UONE share price was $6 earlier this week, and is now over $9.",,
