For example, you buy 2 puts of XYZ @ 165 strike for $4 while it's trading at $167. The stock drops to $164 before any time decay really catches up, in this case you should be able to sell your puts at a profit.

The breakeven for options is indeed strike plus/minus premium but that includes time decay. If you let these puts expire in the money then you will sell the shares at $161. If the stock dips below $161, you're selling the stock at price higher than the market so you're coming out on top. If the stock closes at $162, then you're still selling at $161.

How to interpret these numbers:

If you were to sell a covered call on SPY 6.07% above the weeks opening price, you should expect to see your shares taken away once every 100 weeks. Past performance is not indicative of future performance, but these numbers have been compiled from inception to now, and include about 1000-1500 weeks of data.",nh615i,Past weekly performance of Index ETFs to help you choose covered call prices and avoid getting exercised (On most occasions)

Citadel takes the short position opposite your purchases.  This short position (created as part of their market making activities) drives the price down.  The more retail customers buying through Robinhood (for sure seems to be doing this, dunno about other brokers) the more shorting pressure as the market maker takes the opposite short position to stay net neutral.

The bigger ones might manufacture things and thus have some unique legacy thing going on (planes, vehicles, weapons, etc) but almost anyone can step in to do IT stuff and develop tracking systems and such. The key thus is landing contracts. Just because they work together doesnt mean anything.

This is the same problem I have with Palantir. People dont seem to understand how IT contracting works and that most of these companies are less ""tech"" than engineering services which doesnt scale nearly as well due to the niche/labor factor. But contracting is less risky than startup tech so it just depends on your personal apetities.

And over the last 10 years it's averaged 14%. There was a 10 year window from 2001-2011 where it returned 3%, and if we're to assume a 10% average, then we are prime for a slower decade to balance the huge decade we just had.

I'm currently sitting on a 75% - 130% gain on all three of them and have been collecting a high dividend yield since. 

As you can see on the table below, the book value has been stagnant for the last 3-ish quarters, and are priced very close to book value.

While they haven't necessarily topped out, aside from collecting the high dividend yield, I don't see a clear or significant upside anymore. This is also considering Mortgage REITS historically tend to trade within 1-2% of book value. 

My question - I've been holding these for over a year now, would it be worth paying the capital gains tax to sell and buy something with better growth prospects?

Also, aside from the way over-budget asking price, there were some serious technical issues. Apparently, their design had 'negative mass' aka, it was too heavy for its engines to slow down enough to land on the moon. It is possible Congress will give more money to NASA so they can award a second company along with SpaceX, but this will mostly likely be Blue Origin as they are cheaper than Dynetics and have no inherent technical faults.

Here is a hypothetical, that will ***never*** happen: if suddenly all buy orders disappear then the price drops, and keeps falling, and keeps falling, and no one is buying and everyone's SL is triggered (i.e. active at the next possible buy) but still there are no buys, and it is falling 10%, first Stop of trading. Reopen and it gaps lower, 15% drops to 20% lower and the second break of the day gets called. And actually. This would be the end of the day. Finito. Everyone go home, or better still, to the pub. Have a beerio, you clearly need it. Although no one lost a penny today (in real money) on paper they got obliterated. The next day at open, it gaps lower yet again, 25% and then finally after more decline, a order is filled at -30% and every buy gets hit with a sell order resulting from a stop loss.


Now at this point, because as you put it *everyone* has a stop loss at -5% every single position would get triggered and the market crashes again, resulting in another day of early beer o clock just 5 minutes into the session and 20% down.

And at this point the NYSE might forcefully reset the stop loss orders. Or shut down trading for a day until it's sorted out.

I know my strengths, and I also know my weaknesses. It's my recognized weakness I need assistance with.

Like many, I started in the markets last year. My 1099 for 2020 was a $22,000 loss in the biggest bull run in history. My 2021 is at $0 due to exiting positions at my CB out of fear of further losses. 

I feel you need to understand more about me to offer more sound advice, so, in short: I'm in my late 30s. I spent most of my 20s in and out of homelessness. Sleeping in basements of relatives, friends couches, out of my Jeep Cherokee. I was a failure. The only thing good in my life, was the love of my life, who left me due to me being such a financial disaster. I tried. I really did. I just always failed.

After she left, I fell into alcohol, prescription drugs, and depression. I eventually tried the only thing I hadn't tried - crime. I failed at that, too. I did 4 years in prison.

Since I was released 4 years ago, I have tried to start over. Nobody will hire me now. It took me a solid year to find an employer willing to give me a chance. I work 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, and finally earn a 6 figure salary. The problem is it's killing me. I now have a 180 resting blood pressure and a 14 cortisol level. I'm dying. I can't sustain this forever. I'm trying to use this opportunity to get ahead while I can. Now I keep failing.

My issue: I don't trust myself. I spend hours on DD, and will have a few stocks I like - companies I believe in. I'll wait for an entry, but when it comes, I'm scared to buy it. I hesitate. Then it rallies. Then I get anxiety because I missed it. I get depressed because I was right but failed to act. I can't chase it now because that's what led to my 2020 losses - chasing something only to buy in just before it consolidates. Then I'm depressed because I'm failing again. 

It's like, when the price comes down, I'm scared to buy because it might go lower and I fail. If it goes higher, I don't buy it because I feel like a sucker for not buying it at the lower price yesterday. Then it rallies, and then I get depression anxiety over missing it. Sometimes just having my mouse over the buy button can cause a panic attack. 

Normally I would say I just need to index, but I don't have 30 years to index. I may have another 2 years in me before this job kills me. I will never have another opportunity like this being a felon. I'm trying to seize opportunity and finally make a good enough gain, that I can then invest much more conservatively moving forward. 

My 2 losses last year would have been my biggest gains had I held  - my DD was correct. Even my price targets were correct. I couldn't trust myself. I tried to learn from this. Now I was up $80,000 YTD on 3 positions, but now I have $0 because I rode them all the way down trying not to panic sell like last year. If I hold - I fail. If I sell - I fail. I'm obviously good at picking winners, but how do I get out of my own way? Every time I act, I was wrong. Every time I fail to act, I was right. How can I ever trust myself given my history? How can I learn to overcome this mental obstacle - this crippling doubt?

I'm really trying to be a winner, but I'm really losing heart.",nh8jr8,Trading Psychology Question - Assistance Please

Is this actually the case? Looking at the past decade (I know this doesn't predict future performance per say) but the large caps have grown considerably. AAPL for example doubled from 1T to 2T market cap in just two years which is wild. I know their growth has slowed since then but with them constantly killing earnings and continuously diversifying (M chips etc. ) is there any reason for them to slow or be outperformed by smaller companies this decade? I know they're considered a little overvalued, but that's the nature of large cap growth stocks in general.

Additionally, inflation tends to be less hard on large caps compared to smaller ones. Depending on how much inflation is coming over the next say 3-5 years, won't this also be another advantage for the largest cap companies?

Ford also doesn‚Äôt have a great credit rating, so any money needed to pump into their EV‚Äôs will be quite costly, meanwhile other EV companies in general have much better access to cheap capital.

The order will go to the exchange as a market order as soon as the stock trades at or below your stop price. If the next best bid is 20% less then so be it. Granted, you are describing an extraordinarily rare circumstance because market makers provide the necessary liquidity to keep exactly that from happening. This kind of scenario is much more likely to play out on OTC stocks that trade 5000 shares a day.

A stop market order isn't much different than hitting the 'sell at market' button. The only difference is that you set it to go live only if it reaches a certain threshold. When you hit the sell at market button, how often do you get filled a price 20% lower than the last trade?",,

619,gyuyb32,2021-05-20 19:30:24,t1_gyuyb32,t3_nh8ow5,stocks,"Heres my opinion. Small caps inherently have more room to grow than large caps, it's much easier to go from 500 million to 1 billion than from 500 billion to 1 trillion.

However, most small cap stocks won't be around in the future/won't have seen that exponential growth. I think it's much more likely that MSFT, AAPL etc stick around and continue to grow vs a much smaller startup company that might go bankrupt.

But also, there are very likely a few small cap stocks out there that are genuinely good companies that WILL outperform large caps if all goes well. I think in general, well established companies with long history have more trust and are much safer. The majority, or at least a lot of the small cap stocks don't have that going for them. However, the few small caps that are able to grow, scale and earn a reputation will likely grow at a faster rate than the biggest market cap stocks.

To summarize: Small cap stocks can grow faster but most of them likely won't. There are probably a few winners here and there but those are the exception. My 2 cents",,

Tesla is also production constrained as a whole across their entire lineup. Production issues happen all the time, especially within these past few months, but they are short term problems.

Medium term, the Biden administration has made domestic chip production a priority with $50B of funding for research and production in an upcoming infrastructure bill which should on the floor this summer. Biden clearly also has Ford in mind, seeing as how he just toured their factory and unveiled the F150 lightning. 

Long term Ford stands to be one of the biggest EV manufacturers in the world. The F150 currently rivals the Toyota Corolla in terms of sales numbers.

I think they were in the middle of switch up some production and distribution processes. But it was very well known and talked about in the vegan community. There were entire threads on Reddit on where to find it and buy it.

Like for example my go-to drink at coffee shops is an oat milk latte, and Oatly is the brand I always want, look for, and compliment the shop on when they have it. That's been true for a few years now. When there was a shortage, I had frequent conversations with baristas and resellers about it and they all mentioned that it was a frequent topic and inquiry.

So yes, I think in certain cases, brand loyalty matters and is difficult to measure. Oatly is one of the old-school vegan brands and really is better than the competition.

I‚Äôve long been interested in investing, but I‚Äôm 24 and I haven‚Äôt had any real extra money since living on my own at 18.

I‚Äôm willing to put at most $5k‚Ä¶because if I lose that, it would SUCK but I would be okay.

If you guys have any insight/tips, advice or‚Ä¶.any guidance at all, I would greatly appreciate it.

The reason many people avoid small cap speculative stocks is because they haven't built up their history and reputation, so there is inherently more risk as well as more potential reward. So while there might end up being a few winners, the majority of people who invest in small cap stocks will still get burned because of the sheer number of losers as well.

Also it is expensive to develop EVs right now but by the time they're mass producing them, battery costs will go down even more. Probably not as wildly as the last decade but still enough to make an impact. Their partnership with a established battery maker (SK Innovation) should also help with that. EVs also require less moving parts and less complex manufacturing so there should be better margins once battery costs start coming down.

You can't compare it to the high-growth companies that are trying to achieve mass consumption of a new product over old products.

Ford is still very large and produces many cars and has a wide foot print with lots of experience new competitors don't have.

With technological shift, they will be forced to re-tool. They will need to downsize some operations, upsize others, and create all new ones. Luckily, 3rd part companies are making critical component, like the batteries themselves, so they don't have to build that up front and prices are continuing to fall on batteries.

This isn't to say this is a great buy for massive growth. Rather, it is a stock traders are predicting will slowly go down hill and the market capitalization is very small relative to the size of their operation, rather it is a play at Value. You're making a bet they will have more success at maintaining some market share long-term and be able to re-tool their operations and cut old costs from combustion engine cars more easily than expected.

Said another way, imagine buying one of Tesla's main future competitors for a tiny fraction of TSLA's current market capitalization. TSLA's capitalization is 11x that of F, yet F makes nearly 12x as much revenue currently. F does have declining profitability problems, because of these market changes.

They currently have a P/E ratio of only 12.6. 

The market isn't putting much money or excitement into this, but if there are unknown future hiccups going electric to the masses that cause delays it can be short-term gain for combustion automakers. If Ford can change their operations easier than expected to all EV and remain a competitor there is value not being priced into the stock. These are both scenarios that could lead to short-term success or long-term success for Ford.

I'd also note that the long timeline of transition between combustion cars and electric cars will likely be long enough, that many of the earlier technology patents already established will run out. This will make it easier to competitors to copy each other, which can be both good and bad for various competitors.

I don't directly own Ford. I'm not jumping into this and I haven't really researched it. I'm not arguing they will be successful. 

Rather, I just know it needs to be looked at from a different angle than from the high-growth excitement angle of a new company. It is a Value angle. Cheap price, huge revenue, large brand and foot print.

It is a question if an under-valued company with a far larger operation that will beat expectations on transitioning and potentially scaling down their operations appropriately to achieve profitability in the EV world. There is tremendous value here, if they can adjust and stay a EV competitor in the long-run.

They also have significant brand image and consumer bases that follow them. The F-150 Lightning they are working on is a big product line for them in the long-run. That brand image and customer base is large, if they can make it work and profitable to sell.",,

They have been playing the game a lot longer than 90% of the people in the markets now. They've learned how to make moves without making too much noise.

Stocks snapped their modest three-day losing streak and jumped higher today, with market participants encouraged by the Weekly Unemployment Report and inflationary fears tempering. As I said yesterday, I was encouraged to see volatility decreasing this week after the wild swing the market experienced recently and am even more encouraged by today‚Äôs movement that the sharp sell-off was overdone. 

The Department of Labor released their Weekly Unemployment Report, which showed 444,000 new jobless claims filed, a fresh pandemic low and marginally better than the 450,000 expected by economists. To put this into context, in April of last year, more than 6 million individuals filed jobless claims in one week. While the improvement in the labor market has been extremely encouraging, in the Federal Reserve‚Äôs April meeting minutes (basically notes about what was discussed in the meeting) noted ‚Äúparticipants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee‚Äôs maximum-employment and price-stability goals‚Äù.  

However, it is important to note, the minutes covered the meeting before the release of the April Jobs Report, which came in much weaker than expected (which bolsters the Fed‚Äôs argument that employment remains far from their goal) and the Consumer Price Index, which showed a greater-than-expected increase in consumer prices. That said, the recent reports are extremely unlikely to change the Fed‚Äôs view given Powell and other monetary officials have said they expect any inflation to be ‚Äútransitory‚Äù and want to see a ‚Äústring‚Äù of strong labor reports before adjustments to the current policy are considered.

On a slightly sour note, the meeting minutes also noted ‚Äúa number of participants suggested‚Äù that as the economy continues to quickly, ‚Äúit might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchase‚Äù, which have currently been going at a rate of $120 billion per month. However, this is not a surprising statement and one Powell himself has said before. Back in an April 14 meeting, Powell said, ‚ÄúWe will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.‚Äù As a reminder, quantitative easing is a process in which the Fed buys government bonds in order to inject money into the economy. It is only natural that as the economy recovers, less money needs to be injected into the economy in this manner. The Federal Reserve gave absolutely no signal it was even considering beginning discussion on raising interest rates, which is what market participants are really concerned about.
