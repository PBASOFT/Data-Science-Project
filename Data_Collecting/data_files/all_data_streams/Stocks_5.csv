Nevertheless, I strongly agree with the author. It should be a mandatory tutorial for every new investor to read before  starting their game. 

The problem is that even though we know all of it, we are still influenced by our psychology. 

FOMO (+lack of critical thinking) - whenever someone is posting his/her positive portfolio, I see follow-the-leader strategy, where people blindly jump ship without thinking why it is green and if it's sustainable or not.

Procrastination - Many people are just lazy. Why bother to learn how to do DD, when you can watch 1-2 videos, read few posts or just yolo into random or bluechip stock. We all did it at least once. Sometimes it went well, sometimes not...

Instant gratification - I think this is the most self-destructing mechanism. That's one of the reason why every subreddit has a daily thread. People are following their portfolio every day, wishing to see a sudden jump. We are very sensitive about any slight drop. It's okay if you are day trader or swing trader playing short/mid term, but many claims that they are long-term,  yet still follow their portfolio everyday. We should just put price allerts to buy dips and stay away from our portfolio.",,

There's no selective bias here, you don't invest into the Euro Stoxx 50 unless you want to try beat the market, or speculate that EU markets will be stronger over the next 10 years. The point of Bob is to highlight that even if you do buy at the peak, you'll still come out with a profit eventually. The issue is timing the bottom. Look at indexes, you'll see that in the past, there were times where it looked like the bottom had passed, before it found another bottom.

I read about accumulating ETF Fonds, for example this one: [Xtrackers MSCI World UCITS ETF 1C | 24869934 | IE00BJ0KDQ92 (justetf.com)](https://www.justetf.com/ch/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00BJ0KDQ92#overview). In theory this sounds great for a long term strategy, since your dividends are directly reinvested, without you having to do that manually again and therefore have new fees to pay. Especially in Switzerland, since we pay taxes on dividends but not on capital gains. But I wonder, since there you don't get more shares with that, since there is no rebuy, isn't that kind of a gamble? 

From what I understand, the idea is that when there is more money in the fonds the value and with that the price of a share goes up. But since the price of one share is not directly linked to the money in the fonds isn't there a real danger that the dividends are reinvested and the price of a share goes down nonetheless and therefore you just losing basically the dividends? Or is my thinking off?",ng48mj,Distributing vs Accumulating ETF Fonds

Maxed out RIRA for last year and working on this year. 401k 4% match (small paychecks) in mutual funds, about $72 given to me, I give $120. My current amount of liquid/semi-liquid money is $46,000. I need to balance it still and plan on the overall structure being:

60% ETF's
20% Stocks.  27-32 years.  7-9% interest rate
20% Crypto

ETF's being: $27,000
30% VONG --for high growth large cap
15% VIOG --for high growth small cap
10% VTI --for a mix of everything
5% VSS --for slight exposure to other non US markets

Stocks being: $9,200
  Currently held: 
         TESLA- $3,393
         Plug Power- $1207
          Nio- $906
Not allocated: $3694

*I'm thinking about AMD or NVIDIA, Tilray, Sony. No idea what other sectors are decent to invest in as service providers like Edison or PGE have looked terrible since I started investing, and I don't know what other companies might be a good decision.

Crypto being: $9200
At this point in time planning on holding it on an exchange until I feel comfortable buying in.
______________________________________________________

FIRE (If 50 counts)

This is based ONLY on my ETF's so I will hopefully have a lot of wiggle room to get to this point and stay there or grow before accounting for my stocks, crypto, and 401k.

I used investor.gov compound interest calculator. Assuming I put $27,000 in with monthly contributions of $1500 (should be possible) at an interest rate of 7-9% for 27-32 years, at 50-55 years old I will have ~$2,125,000.

From there, withdrawals of ~8500/month pretax at even 5% will result in more money being made than spent, after 40 years the total being $2,638,000. 

Did I do this correctly and is it realistic? I'd like to think that an average 7% return is reasonable and even conservative. Maybe I'm overthinking it but aside from taxes, is the separation of the ETF's between a RIRA and normal exchange going to make an impact on that $2,000,000?  Any thoughts and are there any major flaws in my thinking?",,

286,,2021-05-19 13:02:34,t3_ng58hg,,stocks,"On May 13 the company reported earnings. The stock reaction has been muted due to low volume. The intense volatility in the name has slowed, as a FEW sophisticated  investors have accumulated meaningful starter positions (emphasis on only a few).  The earnings release and recent news has addressed and alleviated the lingering concerns by investors over:
-Student loans business- Contracts are being sold off.  Company will focus on healthcare business
-Debt- covenents have been renegotiated into more favorable terms. Proceeds from sale of Student Loans contracts will be used to pay off some debt to the point of easily manageable levels
-Healthcare business- continues to grow. More contracts secured. Mgmt also confirmed a robust pipeline of new contracts in the works. Margins expected to be 30% sustainably once we re-open

Like everyone, the quarter was impacted by covid. no surprise. The first unaffected quarter will be rockstar- hitting the screens of all investors that are currently unaware. As a turnaround story these companys cannot be easily found.

1)
On the conference call, we see for the first time two institutional investor participants.
Chris Krug- Chatham Harbor Capital (AUM unknown)
and
Craig Melcher- Tudor Investment Corporation (AUM 45B+, even small cap funds would have significant size)

During the conference call, these investors asked critical questions ot which management provided reassuring feedback and responses. What we draw fomr this is that new players in the institutional landscape are vocally following this name.

2)
A few days ago, the institutionally well-followed podcast known as The Contrarian Investor Podcast recently hosted an episode with Chris Krug above. (Link: contrarianpod....dot...com). in which Chris pitches PFMT as a table punding buy. Fast forward to 15 minutes 40 seconds. I recommend everyone listen to this pitch as he does an excellent job of simplifying a complicated company. Especially helpful for those sitting on the fence unsure whether to buy stock.


3)
An exclusive online investing network known as CoInvestor Club (coinvestorclub......dot.....com/) , followed by a many of NOrth Americas top hedgefund, micro/small/mid-cap portfolio managers, and high networth accredited investors has recently announced in their weekly newsletter and posted on twitter (@CoINvestorCLub1) that they will be hosting Chris Krug TOMORROW Wednesday May 19 to present his BEST investment idea- no other details shared.  Given the recent events, it is very likely that Chris continues to pitch PFMT. Volume uptick into the close today confirms this could be the case.

These new investors see the underlying value in Performant and have clearly done a thorough due dilligence. Expect a sophisticated educational campaign to initiate in the insitutional investing world. These are no longer small retail investors but large funds that will push the price much higher. Tomorrows presentation is only the begining. Expect many value and micro cap investors to be tuning in. Once PFMT is confirmed to be the best idea, expect a pop in the price. As well as continued spreading through word of mouth, mgmt appearing at investor conferences to generate exposure to investors. This was a $1B market cap company not too long ago.  This could be the last opportunity to buy this turnaround company at cheap levels before the coming multiple re-rate bring it to $8+ or it gets acquired at a significant  premium.",ng58hg,Performant Financial (PFMT) - The Facts

1 - Learn about indexes and industries rather than individual companies. This will open up the world of index funds and ETFs.

2 - Learn about the big name blue chips. Now you're looking at the companies that you see around you in everyday life like Apple and Google. Fundamentally, these companies are rock solid but you'll need to keep an eye out to see if there are any changes that will make you want to sell your stake and move on.

3 - Start diving deeper and understand dividends and dividend aristocrats. You'll learn how to tie in the growth of the stock with the dividend yield/growth rate.  

4 - Now you're knowledgeable enough to get into fundamentals and understand how companies trade relative to fundamentals. This allows you to look for values in budding industries that you may not immediately be familiar with. Now you're starting to get into an advanced level.

5 - Next is technical analysis and charting.  This allows you to get into short term investing for quick profits. 

6 - Options and other alternative investments is next and that will allow you to also turn quick and big profits with more leverage.",,

When evaluating your investment decisions (whether you want to short lumber or go long, I don’t personally care which your preference is) it is important you understand what is actually going on, what some of these terms actually mean and what inferences can *actually* be drawn from the data.  If you go by what the clickbait out there is feeding you, you will likely get burned.

**Western SPF lumber *futures* ARE NOT the same as current Lumber *Prices* **

The lumber futures contracts traded in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange are futures contracts for a very specific type of dimensional lumber: Western SPF KD 2x4 #2&Btr.  It is not the current price of “lumber” that wholesalers or builders are currently paying this week for new orders.  Nor is it a predictor of what lumber will be at the month of expiration. [For example, here’s a screenshot from ~ first week of February 2021 showing the price of futures when Western SPF cash prices were about $950.](https://imgur.com/a/GQOfvFD)  It is simply a helpful indicator.

There are many different types of lumber products that sell at many different prices.  If you are not using the CME to trade WSPF futures, it is simply one of many data points to be used to assess the general state of the industry.  It is not always an accurate reflection of the current price of lumber.  (It may be important to Google “Backwardation vs Contago” before you start drawing inferences on these futures price patterns.)

The cash or “Spot” market is what builders/wholesalers buying from the mills are paying RIGHT NOW for the new orders of lumber.  So when you here Lumber twitter talking about spot price, they are talking about cash prices right now.

The Random Lengths composite number is another cash price indicator; an average price of the main various types of dimensional lumber being sold that week.  It is the closest thing to a single price of dimensional lumber out there.  BTW, the Composite is up this week (~$1500 USD), and it was up last week.

The main lumber spot prices are also updated every week by Madison’s lumber Report.  You have to pay to get access to their reports, same with Random Length’s composite.  But sometimes you’ll get free posts, like this one: [Madison’s Lumber Reporter](https://madisonsreport.com/).  Also you can get people on Lumber twitter posting where cash markets are for the day, like the tweet up above.

**Is the Price of Lumber Crashing?  NO! Or not yet at least**

Let me start by saying, Lumber is not sustainable at $1400-$1600 mbf.  No one in the industry wants lumber that high because it is not sustainable. Lumber prices need a healthy correction, sooner rather than later.  

That being said, there’s been a lot of chicken littles panicking and bears celebrating because the lumber futures market has been limit down from 1700 to ~1200 in the last week.  THIS IS NOT THE PRICE OF LUMBER.  The spot price of lumber HAS NOT dropped steadily for the last seven days. (See Madison Report) [https://imgur.com/a/WArizXg].  In fact it has been rising, and is projected to CONTINUE to rise in the short term due to demand. [Go to the last section of this Bloomberg Article for a sensible discussion of Lumber’s immediate future]( https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/plunge-in-lumber-contracts-signals-turning-point-for-wood-rally)

Will the cash drop at some point? YES.  Does it need to drop? YES! It probably is not sustainable long term on these prices and we want the industry to do well for years; not months.  Even if lumber dropped 50% from its current cash price (~$1500 USD) to ~$750, and then that became a new base for the next few years, those years would be the best years in industry history, other than 2021.   

**So why are lumber futures crashing if price isn’t?**

I don’t know for certain, but likely a combination of things.  With the surge in prices, speculators piled into the futures market and drove up the price, hit and top and then surged out.  Now we are seeing a bit of capitulation. (google it).  With that run up, apparently there was [a bit of a short squeeze on lumber]( https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-lumber-trader-stinson-dean-164741704.html) that is now over.  Also, the futures market very recently increased the margin requirements, which may have further pushed out some speculators.  Now we have a big drop, maybe healthy overcorrection, and these futures will get back to reasonable backwardation.

**Implications for the Lumber Stocks**

For those considering liquidating shares or buying puts on lumber right now, context is very important.  Go look at historical price of lumber.  Current July futures has dropped all the way to $1250 mfb (USD).  If the average price of dimensional lumber drops all the way to ~$800-900 mbf (USD) which is still another 30% drop from current Futures price, and if lumber remained that way for a year, **it would be the best year in the industry’s history.**  

These lumber companies’ stock prices are currently valued at an annual lumber runrate of $500-$550 and are sitting at about the same as their 2018 stock price which had an average price of ~$500 mbf USD for the year. This post is not about debating what that means for future value and I am not telling you what to do, but it is an important consideration regardless of what your perspective is on these cyclicals.

**But CNBC said housing starts had a HUGE drop. So doesn’t that mean demand is cratering due to high prices? NO!**

I literally saw this question on twitter and facepalmed.  April housing start data was released today.  Everyone had their spin on it.  Clickbait sources added dramatic language to make it sound like everything is crashing because it fits the fear mongering narrative.  

Let’s look at it from both sides and see what it actually says and what it doesn’t’ say. Here’s the US Census link so you can read it yourself. [Link](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf)  Here’s the Wellsfargo link with a better breakdown. [Link](https://externalcontent.blob.core.windows.net/pdfs/pdfs/8173fa2e-3b8d-4239-bce0-b34b022d540a.pdf)

**The Basic Numbers**

US Housing starts for April 2021 came out to an annual rate of 1.569 million housing units.  That is a 9% decrease from the annualized rate in March 2021, which was 1.733 million.  However it also was a **67% increase** from the prior year April 2020 which was 938K housing starts. 

Obviously comparing to April 2020 can give a misleading impression of current trends given what was going on back then.   I added it because CNBC, the other media outlets and Inflation-Twitter used the year-over-year metric from the CPI numbers in order to more effectively push the fear-mongering inflation narrative. Whereas now they back to the MoM metric in order to get the most clicks.  

US Housing permit numbers are up to annual rate of 1.76 million; a slight increase (.3%) from March’s permit numbers and a 61% increase from April 2020.  

Single Family housing starts (which consume the most lumber) were down 13.4% from March 2021.  Multi-Family homes were up at 470K.  Single Family home completions for April 2021 were at a rate of 1.045 million; a .1% increase over March 2020.

**Is the Sky Falling? No or not yet anyways.**

Housing starts are down from the prior month and it was unexpected.  That absolutely can be the beginning of a headwind forming for the homebuilders and lumber stocks.  Frankly, it is quite possible we will see even more decline in housing starts in the May numbers that will be released in June.  But in reality, until we are seeing multiple straight months of substantial declining housing starts, then it’s just noise.  

Yes, there are anecdotal stories of developers throttling back due to lack of supplies or uncertainty in prices. This data is consistent with those preliminary reports.  However, there’s also a massive amount of anecdotal evidence pointing in the opposite direction. [Like this great example of a national homebuilder reporting they have sold out all of there spec homes AND lots in NC!!!]( https://twitter.com/MattBrubakerNC/status/1394787807978311680)

This report was a hiccup and unexpected, but this report had a massive amount of silver linings, when you factor in the context, none of which are really acknowledged by the clickbait articles or social media.

**So WHY are housing starts down then?**

Well, the clickbait implies it’s from Lumber prices, along with other commodity prices.  While that may be the case for a small percentage of the smaller builders/contractors, that thesis doesn’t make sense when you look at the big picture.  

1) When lumber jumped ~300% over the course of 2020 and early 2021, that appeared to have literally no impact on the rate of housing starts.  To the contrary, building rates increased during this time!  All of a sudden that 67% increase in starts YoY becomes a bit more relevant…  The idea that the price increases from March to April all of a sudden caused a 13% drop in single family homes, while demand still surged, is silly.

2) The social/clickbait medias literally ran these EXACT same headlines in February when the January housing numbers dropped ~6% from December’s numbers.  “HOUSING STARTS DOWN AMIDST A SURGE IN LUMBER PRICES.” It sells and is easy for people to understand, but correlation does not equal causation.  Shark attacks increase in the US when Ice cream sales go up.  Does that mean one causes the other? No.  It means both increase during the summer when more people are eating ice cream and swimming in the ocean due to the heat.  Same principle applies here with these housing starts numbers and the futures surge.

The reality is **the builders simply don’t have sufficient supplies or labor** to sustain that build rate (1.7 mill annual starts) right now, and apparently there were some weather issues in the south as well.  [Wells Fargo Article discussing exactly this](https://externalcontent.blob.core.windows.net/pdfs/pdfs/8173fa2e-3b8d-4239-bce0-b34b022d540a.pdf).  In other words, housing starts are mostly constrained by what we have supplies to build which shouldn’t really surprise anyone given the next point:

**April housing starts were at or close to the NA Lumber Industry’s max production capacity**

West Fraser recently put out a presentation on the status of North America’s current lumber [production capacity in terms of housing starts from 2020 data.  [Here’s the Link of the graph](https://imgur.com/a/uQhI6V4).  Based on data from the FEA and NAHB, by the end of 2020, North America really only had the ability to produce lumber for about ~1.5 million housing starts a year.  The lumbers mills are working to improve efficiencies, and maybe that number has gone up a bit (maybe 5-10% by end of the year?).  But nothing major because it takes multiple years to build sawmills and get them operational.  

So what does that mean?  From another angle, April’s housing start numbers are essentially at NA’s current lumber production capacity despite these records prices.  [Probably why the lumber companies were reporting bullish new like this only two weeks ago.]( https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sawmills-selling-boards-faster-cut-142931825.html)  Not exactly a great indicator of an imminent crash in lumber prices *to pre pandemic levels* which is what certain people online want you to think is about to happen.  

**Immediate Future Outlook Also Shows High Demand**

The housing permits increase, despite the surge in lumber prices, shows that builder sentiment is still overall positive and there is even more demand in line waiting for lumber.  The major home builders have passed on the costs to consumers with little problem so far. This is a strong support for the “higher for longer” crowd who have been predicting lumber will stay at historically high margins for longer than 2021 Q2 (which ends in 6 weeks…).

To get some historical context on how much pent-up supply-constrained home construction demand we have: The proportion of authorized housing construction which haven’t begun construction yet is now at the highest level since 1979. [Link](https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/status/1394638539900469252)  That’s a lot of people waiting in line outside the venue, trying to get in.  Would you expect concert ticket prices to drop when there’s a line half-mile long outside the venue…?  

You can also review Chief Economist/Housing Market Expert [Ali Wolf’s twitter feed](https://twitter.com/AliWolfEcon?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) for non-stop anecdotes and stats demonstrating how the new housing market is STILL booming despite these high lumber costs. 

**2020’s Biggest Driver of Lumber Demand Projected to Keep Growing**

According to FEA and other trade groups, the biggest end-use of lumber in 2020 was the renovation sector. [Link to Graphic](https://imgur.com/a/qxsP0i6).  Anecdotally, a lot of people have been saying that they will delay projects because lumber costs too much.  And a bunch of Youtube “economists/investigative journalists” like to go to Home Depot or Lumber yards to show all the wood still there (as if that were valid field research) and cry conspiracy.  And it makes sense that with more people returning to work and the economy reopening that DIY would go down.  

However, the Joint Center for Housing Studies at this place called Harvard University (America’s favorite safety school?) has projected the opposite. [link to study] (https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/press-releases/remodeling-upturn-carry-2022).  While they acknowledge that the smaller DIY projects and renovations are tapering off, the larger professional jobs are picking up.  Demand will stay were it is for the rest of the year and then likely pick up even more in Q1 2022.  It is partly due to jobs that were put off during the pandemic closures, but also from people making more investments in their home because of the current housing market. 

Also, the Home Depot CFO also confirmed that from their side, they are still seeing strong demand on the renovation side from their end and don't expect it to drop any time soon. [Link to earnings call transcript](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/18/home-depot-hd-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript/)  

Takeaway, I have no doubt that there has been some decrease in demand for lumber from the DIY crowd, but that the drop in demand isn’t as bad as youtube makes it look like and any demand that fell from DIYers is likely being covered by demand from another source: the professional renovations. 

**But isn’t this 2005 all over again thus crash imminent? Not Yet**

There are some things that this housing market has in common with 2005/2006.  But there are also many things that this market does not have in common.  I am not going to get into the differences in the health of the financial markets vs now.  They are different.  A large portions of the home loans are sub-prime mortgage loans.  If you have credible data to the contrary, please share.  

Also, I am not trying to suggest that housing will stay on it’s current manic trajectory.  The housing market is not healthy and at some point it will slow down dramatically or it will correct.  But that’s probably not happening in the next couple months.

From a Supply/Demand standpoint, 2005/2006 are extremely different from today.  Is the housing market manic right now? Yes.  Prices are rocketing up like crazy, similar to ‘05/’06. However, the fundamentals driving this housing market surge is different.   

Inventory of available homes is dramatically different.  In 2005/2006, home prices were shooting through the roof even though the inventory of available homes was also shooting up. [Link to graphic](https://imgur.com/a/bZwtnqd).  On top of that, the US was at an annualized rate of ~2.1 million home starts in 2005.  

So the market was *flooded* with new homes on top of existing available inventory.  For awhile people kept paying more and more for those homes, ignoring the basic economic principle of supply/demand.  However, we have the opposite problem now: there aren’t enough homes to go around.  We are currently at a record low supply of homes compared to demand/population.  So, from that perspective, there is at least a rational basis for the price to soar: scarcity.  Something that wasn’t present then.

The same thing difference exists for lumber supply capacity in NA.  In 2005/2006, NA lumber production/capacity was around ~75 billion board feet.  Current production capacity at end of 2020 was just under 60 billion Board feet. [Link for Graphic](https://imgur.com/a/31E3Aue).  The industry plans to increase its capacity by making some new mills right now, but that will taking another year or more and it’s nothing dramatic that will substantially change the calculus in the next 1-2 years.

So unlike 2005, while the surge in home prices is similar to 2005, the market conditions causing that price surge are fundamentally different, so it is unclear if any credible inferences can be drawn from that time period in assessing our current cycle.

**TLDR:** There are a bunch of morons out there throwing around terms they don’t understand and drawing conclusions that aren’t supported by the larger datasets.  Lumber prices are still rising, even though futures are dropping.  The cash price of lumber WILL correct this summer, but likely not to pre pandemic levels. Make sure you do your homework before making investment decisions regarding housing/lumber.  I am not a financial advisor.    

If anyone identifies flaws in the analysis, please share.  I’d really like to know if I’m missing something here because when I go online and read the commentary, I feel like I am taking crazy pills.

**Disclosure:** I hold lumber and building materials tickers: RFP, LPX, and WFG.",ng666b,Lumber DD: Ignore the Misinformation/Clickbait. The actual price of lumber is still RISING and data shows future demand still very high.
485,,2021-05-19 13:41:42,t3_ng66cd,,stocks,"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/19/palantir-stock-trader-lays-out-bullish-case-for-software-company.html?&qsearchterm=palantir

Palantir may have fallen victim to the high-growth tech sell-off, but TradingAnalysis.com founder Todd Gordon sees an opportunity to add to his position.

The software-as-a-service stock is down 10% this year, well underperforming the broader market.

Gordon sees success ahead for Palantir as a company, and subsequent outperformance for its stock, noting one overlooked area of the company’s operations.

“This is an aspect of the business that not a lot of people talk about and that was that they were a key player in the Covid battle. Medical suppliers used the Palantir software to monitor global supply chains and then they helped to measure shortages and imbalances of supplies and proactively move those supplies around to meet the demand,” Gordon told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Tuesday, specifically pointing to the success of vaccine rollouts in the U.S. and U.K.

Palantir generates the bulk of its revenue through government contracts. Its government segment makes up nearly 56% of total sales with commercial as the remainder.

Recent positions from some of Wall Street’s most notable players also support Gordon’s bull case. Stanley Druckenmiller’s Duquesne Family Office recently disclosed a new stake of nearly 6 million shares of Palantir, while Cathy Wood’s ARK Invest also holds a position.

Its technical position also looks set up for a push higher, Gordon said.

“Technically speaking here, you can see there’s been a pretty unbelievable run ever since they came to the market, rallied all the way up to $44, and then what you see here is a pretty common three-wave technical correction,” he said.

The triangle formed by that middle wave of the correction suggests to Gordon that the stock could break out to the upside.

To take advantage of that move, Gordon lays out one potential trade – putting on a 25/30 call debit spread with Aug. 20 expiration. A move up to $30, the higher end of that spread, implies more than 40% upside from its Tuesday close above $21.",ng66cd,CNBC | One area of success investors may overlook when it comes to Palantir stock

FTR, I've never listened to FOX news in my life.  So where's that coming from? 

Yes, the Capital Gains tax will be effective Jan 2021.  Meaning what ever you did between when it becomes tax policy and Jan 1st, it will be included.  I've heard, this $million in income is BS.  That # will be far less.  

Just like Obamacare.  The first year, he didn't collect a thing through payroll.  He collected all that tax at once, straight out of cash.  

Truth is, there are people who will get sick of the tax policy and just flat out retire. Then what?  That tax bill will seep deep into middle class territory.   I'm set up for several years and more, I have the cash set aside.  

But please explain how giving a person $300 for their under 5 year olds is infrastructure?  And $250 til they are 18.  Yellen must be off her rocker to have been put up to even making that case yesterday.  

This is why wages are up here anyway, because people are being incentivized to stay home and now July 15th even more so.

The market fell modestly on Monday, as concerns over rising inflation, marked by a higher than expected print in the April Consumer Price Index (CPI), continued. Technology stocks continued their volatility, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) going as low as 1.42% down intraday before recovering and closing 0.59% down. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 0.26% down and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed.

Stocks are coming into this week on the heels of an extremely choppy trading period recently, which saw the SPY pulling back 4% before recovering Thursday and Friday of last week after the April CPI and Producer Price Index (PPI) came in higher than expected. The CPI, which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. 

The PPI, which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output, rose 6.2% compared to April 2020 and 0.6% monthly increase. The core PPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 4.6% year over year and 0.7% in April. Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 0.3% monthly increase in April and 3.8% year over year. This is the biggest jump since 2014. In tandem with the CPI report, this shows prices for both consumers and producers have increased more than expected. Market participants are concerned that high levels of inflation may cause the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. 

While the readings in inflation definitely are not good, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” The April Job Report bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

In addition, at a separate event in April, Powell said that quantitative easing would likely taper “well before” the interest rate is increased. He said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” In short, while the inflationary readings are not great, I’m fairly confident fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy sooner-than-expected are overblown. Just my two cents. 

There are several factors, in my opinion, contributing to the rise of inflation. First, after the collapse in prices during the height of the pandemic and lockdowns, it is not surprising to see prices comparatively much higher than last year as demand and consumer spending surges as the US economy reopens. 

Second are widespread supply shortages and manufacturing bottlenecks in key materials, limiting production capability and driving up delivery time, and as a result, driving up prices. One prominent example you may be familiar with is the global shortage in semiconductors, which is causing automobile manufacturers across the industry to limit production. A similar situation is happening across an array of consumer goods. As the economy in the US reopens thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine, supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures as expected and transitory. In an April 28 meeting, Jerome Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.” 

Third are historic levels of fiscal spending by the Federal Government in the form of stimulus and other benefits. Federal debt—incurred when the government sells Treasury bonds, bills, notes, and other securities to cover its costs—recently hit an all-time high. However, policymakers are not concerned with the debt at current levels. Jerome Powell said, “Given the low level of interest rates, there's no issue about the United States being able to service its debt at this time or in the foreseeable future.” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen echoed a similar sentiment in a recent interview, saying “Even with inflation data coming in hotter than economists expected, long-term bond yields declined, indicating the market has been anticipating inflationary pressures for a while and are reassured by the Federal Reserve’s commitment to move slowly when raising rates.

Commenting on the annual results, Michael Haack, President and CEO, said, “Across all measures, fiscal 2021 was extraordinary for Eagle as we met and overcame challenges that were inconceivable just a year earlier. The resilience of our business model, our financial discipline and our team’s operational and strategic execution allowed us to deliver record financial results, integrate the largest acquisition in the Company’s history and further streamline our business portfolio by divesting several non-core businesses, all while achieving industry leading safety performance. Our strong operating cash flow enabled us to reduce leverage to under 1.5 times net debt-to-EBITDA, providing us with significant liquidity and increased financial flexibility.”

Mr. Haack continued, “As we begin our new fiscal year, Eagle is well-positioned, both geographically and financially, with ample raw material reserves to capitalize on the underlying demand fundamentals that are expected to support steady and sustainable construction activity growth over the near and long-term. We remain confident in Eagle’s prospects for continued growth and sustainable value creation for all shareholders.”

Mr. Haack concluded, “I want to thank our dedicated employees for their exceptional efforts and focus during this unprecedented time. We have a long history of managing through challenging market conditions, and we have once again shown the benefits of our business model as we navigated through this unpredictable year.”

Decision to Remain a Combined Company

Eagle’s Board of Directors has decided not to pursue the proposed separation of Eagle Materials into two independent, publicly traded companies at this time. Much has transpired since the announcement of the proposed separation that has caused the Board to reevaluate the separation’s merits:

First, the size and financial strength of the combined Company, with its diversified asset base and geographical footprint and its robust balance sheet, have provided great comfort, stability and value to our shareholders, employees, customers and suppliers during an unprecedented and uncertain time.
Second, given the continued consolidation of the industries in which we participate and the Company’s rigorous examination of a number of strategic alternatives since the announcement of the proposed separation, it has become clear that a combined company with greater financial scale and flexibility will be better positioned to pursue key strategic growth options and enhance shareholder value.
Third, since the announcement of the proposed separation, the Company has streamlined its business portfolio including the divestiture of its Oil and Gas Proppants business and other non-core assets.
Mike Nicolais, Chairman of the Board, commented, “Eagle is exceedingly well-positioned and is performing as well as at any time in its history. Both major business segments continue to post industry leading results on just about every measure. As a shareholder, I could not be more pleased with the position of the combined Company. While the Board will continue to evaluate the merits of a separation on a periodic basis, it has concluded, in consultation with external advisors, that the combined Company is in the best position to create long-term shareholder value.”

Capital Allocation Priorities

Eagle remains dedicated to a disciplined capital allocation process to enhance shareholder value. Consistent with our track record, our allocation priorities remain unchanged: 1. Growth investments that meet our strict financial return standards and are consistent with our strategic focus; 2. Operating capital investments to maintain and strengthen our low-cost producer positions; 3. Return excess cash to shareholders, primarily through our share repurchase program.

In the past three years, we have invested nearly $700 million in acquisitions, $303 million in organic capital expenditures and $626 million in share repurchases and dividends. At March 31, 2021, nearly 7.3 million shares remain under the current repurchase authorization.

Reinstatement and Increase of Quarterly Cash Dividend

Eagle’s Board of Directors today declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share, payable on July 16, 2021, to stockholders of record of its Common Stock at the close of business on June 18, 2021. The reinstated quarterly dividend represents a 150% increase from the quarterly dividend in place prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Mike Nicolais commented, “The reinstatement of our quarterly dividend reflects Eagle’s strong operational and financial performance, our confidence in the resilience of the business, and our commitment to reward shareholders, while preserving the financial flexibility to continue to grow Eagle and create long-term shareholder value.”

Financial Results

Heavy Materials: Cement, Concrete and Aggregates

Fiscal 2021 revenue in the Heavy Materials sector, which includes Cement, Concrete and Aggregates, as well as Joint Venture and intersegment Cement revenue, was $1.1 billion, a 19% improvement. Heavy Materials annual operating earnings increased 27% to $253.0 million primarily because of improved Cement net sales prices and earnings from the recently acquired Kosmos Cement Business.

Fiscal 2021 Cement revenue, including Joint Venture and intersegment revenue, was up 26% to $944.6 million, and Cement operating earnings increased 29% to $234.0 million. The annual revenue and earnings improvements reflect higher sales volume and net sales prices as well as the significant contribution of the recently acquired Kosmos Cement Business, which added approximately $176 million of revenue and $34 million of operating earnings during the year.

The average annual net Cement sales price for the year increased 1% to $111.19 per ton. Organic (not including the recently acquired Kosmos Cement Business) average net Cement sales prices increased 3%. Cement sales volume for the year was a record 7.5 million tons, up 26%. Organic annual Cement sales volume increased 1%.

Fourth quarter Cement revenue, including Joint Venture and intersegment revenue, was up 17% to $171.0 million. Excluding the results of the recently acquired Kosmos Cement Business, revenue was down 1%. Operating earnings decreased 6% to $23.2 million. Eagle’s fourth quarter Cement earnings were affected by a severe winter storm during February 2021 which had a significant impact on Texas and the broader Southern United States. Our cement facilities in Texas, Missouri and Oklahoma were forced to curtail production during the storm and energy prices spiked during this time period. We estimate the storm’s impact on Cement operating earnings was approximately $6 million primarily due to higher costs during the quarter. We are still engaged in discussions with contractual counterparties regarding the responsibility for certain charges and obligations arising as a result of the storm, and therefore, it is not possible at the present time to make a final determination as to the storm’s impact on our financial results.

The average net Cement sales price for the quarter increased 2% to $112.77 per ton. Organic average net Cement sales prices increased 3%. Cement sales volume for the quarter was up 17% to a record 1.4 million tons. Organic quarterly Cement sales volume declined 2% to 1.1 million tons.

Fiscal 2021 revenue from Concrete and Aggregates decreased 7% to $168.7 million because of the divestiture of our northern California concrete and aggregates businesses during the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Concrete and Aggregates reported fiscal 2021 operating earnings of $19.1 million, up 9%, reflecting improved organic sales volume and pricing as well as operating efficiencies, including lower diesel fuel costs.

Fourth quarter Concrete and Aggregates revenue was $34.8 million, a decrease of 12%, because of the divestiture of our northern California concrete and aggregates businesses. Fourth quarter operating earnings were $3.3 million, a 30% increase, reflecting improved sales volume and pricing and improved operating efficiencies.

Light Materials: Gypsum Wallboard and Paperboard

Fiscal 2021 revenue in the Light Materials sector, which includes Gypsum Wallboard and Paperboard, increased 5%, reflecting improved Wallboard sales volume and pricing. Gypsum Wallboard annual sales volume was a record 2.9 billion square feet (BSF), up 6%, while the average Gypsum Wallboard net sales price increased 1% to $149.62 per MSF. Given the improved demand outlook for single-family construction activity in the US and increasing demand for our products, we implemented wallboard price increases during the second half of our fiscal year. We also announced a wallboard price increase for early April 2021.

Fiscal 2021 operating earnings were $192.8 million, an increase of 2%, driven by improved sales volume and pricing, partially offset by increased operating cost, primarily due to higher recycled fiber costs and startup costs associated with our paper mill expansion.

Fourth quarter Gypsum Wallboard and Paperboard revenue increased 15% to $176.9 million, reflecting improved Wallboard sales volume and pricing. Gypsum Wallboard sales volume increased 3% to 706 million square feet (MMSF), while the average Gypsum Wallboard net sales price increased 10% to $161.07 per MSF.

Paperboard sales volume for the quarter increased 4% to a record 82,000 tons. The average Paperboard net sales price for the fourth quarter was $481.40 per ton, up 5%, consistent with the pricing provisions in our long-term sales agreements.

Fourth quarter operating earnings in the sector were $52.4 million, an increase of 15%, reflecting improved Wallboard sales volume and pricing partially offset by the impact of the winter storm in February 2021. Our Oklahoma paper mill was forced to curtail production during the week of the storm and also experienced higher energy costs during the shutdown. Additionally, our wallboard shipments were significantly affected by the harsh winter conditions. We estimate the storm affected fourth quarter Light Materials operating earnings by approximately $6 million. We are still engaged in discussions with contractual counterparties regarding the responsibility for certain charges and obligations arising as a result of the storm, and therefore, it is not possible at the present time to make a final determination as to the storm’s impact on our financial results. Although the operating earnings of our Light Materials sector were adversely affected by the storm, we were able to curtail some of our operations and release a portion of our natural gas commitments to third parties in a timely manner. The release of these commitments contributed to a significant increase in Other Non-Operating Income in the fourth quarter.

Sale of Oil and Gas Proppants Business

On September 18, 2020, the Company sold its Oil and Gas Proppants business to Smart Sand, Inc. The current-year and prior-year financial results of the Oil and Gas Proppants segment have been classified as Discontinued Operations on the Statement of Earnings. The assets and liabilities of the Oil and Gas Proppants segment have been reflected on separate lines for Discontinued Operations on the Balance Sheet.

Details of Financial Results

We conduct one of our cement plant operations through a 50/50 joint venture, Texas Lehigh Cement Company LP (the Joint Venture). We use the equity method of accounting for our 50% interest in the Joint Venture. For segment reporting purposes only, we proportionately consolidate our 50% share of the Joint Venture’s revenue and operating earnings, which is consistent with the way management organizes the segments within Eagle for making operating decisions and assessing performance.

In addition, for segment reporting purposes, we report intersegment revenue as a part of a segment’s total revenue. Intersegment sales are eliminated on the consolidated statement of earnings. Refer to Attachment 3 for a reconciliation of these amounts.

Then they would launch an app store in the cars.  Think how much Apple makes with app store.

They might launch a robotaxi network.  If they cannot scale fast enough they could lease the autonomous driving software to other companies as SaaS.

There is also there energy product, insurance, battery technology, and artificial intelligence innovations, which could have big potential.  But IMO the key is autonomy.
