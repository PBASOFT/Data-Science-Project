21,gyxnp5b,2021-05-21 12:09:53,t1_gyxnp5b,t1_gyvtig5,investing,"""She runs a bunch of hyper growth funds and you're absolutely right that hyper growth isn't going to outperform every year""

It's not going to perform every year but after 150%+ gains (which ""unless this time is very different"" were not going to repeat) last year she really would have been rewarded for playing at least a little defense and being a little more cautious. If after 150% gains she came out and said, ""hey, I'm going to sit in cash a little because I'm not seeing as many opportunities after that kind of run"" and the funds held up better than they did in the rotation in recent months, she would have seen even more money pour in and would have likely impressed a lot of her critics (including Cramer, which is odd given that CNBC broadly seems like it's never been critical of a guest *ever* that I can recall.) ""OMG, she had performance like that last year and she was able to play some defense/pivot when it was called for?"" 

And I'm not a critic, really - I just have what I think are sorta reasonable concerns.

I guess what I'd love to hear from her is some change in opinion at times. It's ""I love hyper growth"" 24/7/365. It's okay to be a hyper growth manager and come out and say, ""there's not as many opportunities right now."" I don't know that I've ever heard her talk about something growth-related she doesn't like. She's talked about not liking value but I'd love to hear that she doesn't like this sector of growth, or a hyper growth name for some reason. Every ""disruptive"" theme seems like it's exciting/potentially worthwhile to Ark.

""She believes over a 5 year time horizon, her basket of hyper growth is likely to double in value, or I guess now it's 125% of value. I agree that's silly.""

I think it's very promotional. I don't recall a mutual fund/ETF manager making 5 year predictions on their performance at all (or performance predictions like that in general), but she has now done it twice in 6 months and has upped it. She has talked about corrections in the past, but I think all of the hype over future performance offsets that. My concern becomes new/er investors performance chasing/over-allocating because of past performance/hype. Early this year I said on here when I started to see people talking about ""100% Ark"" and ""How Many Ark Funds Do You Own?"" that people shouldn't chase what was very likely not sustainable performance and should not have that sort of allocation.

""she's a fraud because her funds are down 30% from their high after a 150% 1Y return""

She's definitely not a fraud. I think she's an aggressive promoter and never seems to dial down her view/hype of the universe of stocks she's interested in. While she has certainly discussed the long-term (and predicted her long-term performance) the promotion can feel a little short-term focused. 

""mixing faith and investing.""

I don't have any issue with that at all. There are a number of various faith-based funds. 

""I find the cult of personality silly and she has certainly fed it""

I think the sort of aggressive promotion/cult of personality benefits during the good times but it's the opposite when things turn. The ""cult of personality"" certainly benefited Ark last year when people started copycatting anything she was doing and waiting for the trade lists every day to buy what Cathie was buying - more buying of Ark names, Ark goes up further, more performance chasing, more money coming in (""What we've seen over the past year plus is equivalent to like 16 Januses during that firm's heyday."", https://twitter.com/syouth1/status/1360958603746811907), more Ark buying these names, more people copycatting, etc etc etc. 

They're ETFs, so they're not going to close and does it get to a point where asset bloat is a problem? There is the sub-advised mutual fund (which is basically sort of the mutual fund version of ARKK - american beacon ark transformational innovation fund) that they could have closed but did not. 

""For example, can you say you disagree with the 5-year prospects of most of ARKF's top 10 holdings? ""

For most of those no and fintech/payments is one area that I've actually added to over the last several months. But it's a question of how much to allocate even with a long-term view and whether the last few months is simply a rotation out of growth or more of a short-to-medium-term change where growth and the appetite for rich valuations is not going to be there to the same degree for a while.

Last year's performance in growth I think lead to some people feeling that that performance validated/confirmed those themes and signaled more gains ahead - including EVs, where stocks of many of the newly public companies have been obliterated.  That's not to say that EVs won't continue to be a theme, but you had a ""buy at any price"" mania for companies some of which won't have a product for a while and one of which (WKHS, which ARKQ still owns some shares of) delivered 6 trucks last quarter but was at one point valued over $5B. Former Reg A IPO (and what looks like a bigger Kickstarter company) FUV is down nearly 80% from February. 

I think the success of Ark last year lead people to focus heavily on ""what's the next disruptive story!?!?!"" but I think people have to focus on what they view as disruptive themes with the most potential and even within those themes have to focus on the highest quality stories. A lot of the EV stuff last year became ""buy anything EV related at any price, I don't care if it's delivered a car or not.""  People can be in a theme that does very well over the next 5 years but wind up bagholding for a long time because they bought high due to short-term hype/bought a weaker company. 

""A “big market delusion,” according to the paper, occurs when all the firms in an evolving industry rise together, despite that fact that they are competing against each other and only some can ultimately succeed. The trio cited airlines as a past example of an industry built around emerging technology, where “virtually every company in the business either failed or merged into a larger airline, most of which also collapsed.”"" (https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1qx4f8709q5nf/Big-Market-Delusion-Rob-Arnott-Attacks-Tesla-Electric-Vehicle-Industry)

And I'm definitely not anti growth by any means. I still own SHOP, SQ, SE, TTD and others. I just think people have to be selective and while something might be a ""big theme"" in the years ahead, you still have to try to buy it well and look for what you think are the best name/s. Something might be a theme but lack many compelling long-term plays.

I'm not anti Ark either. I think I'm really for people constructing a portfolio that they're happy with when markets are good or not. There's a lot of ""OMG WHY IS THE MARKET DOWN?"" posts on this sub and I look and the market is down 1% or something. I'm definitely not ""no Ark"" or no aggressive growth. I think a lot of people think about the upside when they see things perform like Ark has, but they should think about the downside/potential volatility and what sort of allocation if they're going to own long-term is comfortable through positive periods and negative periods - and something like that is certainly capable of tremendous upside when things are great and tremendous downside when things aren't.

But thinking about it - the plant-based milk industry is estimated to generate 21b of revenue in 5 years, it generated 16b of revenue in 2018 iirc. So that's a healthy growth rate, but it's still not a huge market. And that market is much more than just oat milk.

Since they are looking into expanding in the plant-based cheese market I looked that one up as well, and apparently that one generates roughly 1b of revenue globally.

So we're looking at a company that's far from having the leading position or even just a substantial market share in that space as I understand, and that company is valued 13b when the entire global market for it's product + many different alternatives for the foreseeable future generates less than double their valuation in revenue.

Now I know that's not exactly a metric to look at since valuation is much more than just revenue, but I just can't wrap my head around how this is trading at 13b. At the same time I'm having a lot of trouble estimating a fair market cap for them. (Also has to do with me not having been able to look at their financials since they haven't got the report or the F-20 SEC filing on their page.)",,

27,gyxo3vq,2021-05-21 12:14:14,t1_gyxo3vq,t1_gyxlv13,investing,"The “crypto” in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Etherum is there because new coins are generated by process called “mining”, which I would explain in simple terms as “computer solving complex digital puzzles”. This process is what determines the rarity element and that everyone theoretically can “find” new currency. Besides the fact that for mining, you would need a large amount of computing power through GPUs based mining-rigs.

On the other hand a digital currency backed by a central bank can only be generated by the bank itself. There will be no mining process and only the central bank will have the power to generate new coins. With this process the value of each digital coin would be determined by the central bank and would most likely have equal value that their normal currency. In a US example, 1 FED-issued digital coin = 1$.

The advantage for the bank is that every single digital coin would have a unique NTF that would allow to track and trace a specific coin throughout all his life. In turn, this would be a large overview and control power to the bank to follow digital payments. This would facilitate taxation, reduce illegal use of money (such as for criminal transactions, tax avoidance, money laundering).

For the common Joe, it would mean less paperwork and hustle while dealing with the government for payments, but also much less privacy and secrecy.",,

Mr. Collins talks about working in an investment firm that traded a specific sector of the market.  His coworkers spend over 40 hours a week researching companies in a specific industry, having monthly conversations with CEOs, and they still couldn't outperform the market.

The two brokerages I see recommended the most are Vanguard and Fidelity.  I use Vanguard, because they were the first with low-cost index funds, and their ownership structure is set up that everyone that owns their funds is an owner of the company.

Congratulations for starting at 21.  As long as you have your budget set to where you can invest monthly or bi-weekly, you're going to kill it as long as you don't take unnecessary risks.

That was my point, it's not particularly inflationary, and on a longer term basis probably has more deflationary tendencies (although that depends where the $ goes). It DOES keep yields low, which can allow inflation to run hot without tightening financial conditions, but it's not on it's own a cause of inflation. At the end of the day, you need banks to lend and people to spend - QE does not cause this, it just allows the above to occur without rates crashing the party.

> is fiscal stimulus debt or money printing?

Moreso debt on the public side, but that in effect isn't much different from printing since it temporarily expands the money in the system. It's also a good bit more complex as a reserve currency than it would be if we were a non-reserve currency. If it weren't for QE, rising yields would theoretically offset the expansion of money, but QE keeps yields in check, which would allow inflation to rise.",,

110,,2021-05-21 13:36:56,t3_nhspuq,,investing,"Investment Thesis for Daily Journal (DJCO)

Introduction:  The Daily Journal is viewed by the general public as a dying newspaper business.  It is a dying newspaper business, but the Daily Journal has pivoted itself to a SaaS business, but is trading at a valuation far below most other publicly traded Saas businesses.  We will investigate why the Daily Journal is a worthwhile investment at its current valuation.

Management:  Normally, we’d begin by looking at the business, but management within the Daily Journal is incredibly strong, so this will be our beginning.  The Chairman of the Board in Charlie Munger, Vice-Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway.  He bought the Daily Journal in 1977 for $2 million dollars and has been the Chairman ever since.  The lesser known name leading the Daily Journal is Gerald Salzman.  He joined the Daily Journal in 1986 as their President, CEO, CFO, Treasurer.  As such, there is likely no one else who knows the Daily Journal as well as Gerald Salzman.  As an added bonus to the quality of the two men leading the Daily Journal, their executive compensation is almost unheard of.  The Board of Directors receive a payment of either $5000 or $0.  Gerald Salzman, the CEO, receives a salary of $250,000.  These are acceptable salaries due to the large amount of insider ownership within the Daily Journal.

The Business:  The Daily Journal has three business segments, 1) The Daily Journal Newspaper, 2) Equity Investments, and 3) Journal Technologies.

---

The Daily Journal Newspaper is a series of mostly California based legal newspapers.  Their revenue comes from advertising from display advertising (i.e. traditional advertising found in most newspapers), classified advertising, trustee notice sale advertising, legal notice advertising, and circulation advertising.  The sad but unfortunate truth for investors is that this portion of their business is worth very little.  The good news, however, is that most investors outside of the Daily Journal are not interested in investing in a dying newspaper and thus has led to the undervaluation of the Daily Journal.

I won’t spend any more time on this segment except to say that the newspaper’s most successful year isemi-modern history was during 2008 due to an extreme uptick in the need for legal advertising relating to the foreclosure of many homes.  It is possible that if another recession strikes, the newspaper business of the Daily Journal could provide some financial cushion to keep the Daily Journal in strong health.

---

Equities have been a growing proportion of the Daily Journal’s intrinsic value.  Charlie Munger’s investing prowess that has benefited Berkshire is also at work within the Daily Journal.  We have insight into the Daily Journal’s American investments thanks to their most recent 13F filing, which was released within the last week.  At this time, the Daily Journal holds $197 million worth of American equities, mostly concentrated in financial services similarly to the holdings of Berkshire Hathaway.  Another notable holding is a new and growing position in Alibaba.  

While it is not explicitly confirmed, there is a VERY strong evidence that the Daily Journal also holds a sizable position in BYD, a Hong Kong traded electric car manufacturer.  This would not appear in its 13F filings, so its size cannot be confirmed, however we can make an educated guess.  The exact value of his BYD investment is unknown, however it is assumed to be be roughly $140 million.  In the most recent filing, the Daily Journal notes that it sold $20 million of one of its positions to reinvest into another security.  The suspicion is that this was a shift from BYD to BABA.  As such, we will value the BYD position at $120, though in truth, it may be slightly higher as BYD traded at a fewer dollars higher of a valuation prior to the most recent filing.  Nonetheless, we will assume its value is $120 million.  This brings the Daily Journal’s equity portfolio to a value of $317 million.

The Daily Journal also has $27 million in cash according to their latest annual report and they hold some office buildings in Los Angeles and in Utah which THEY value at $16.5 million.  I emphasized that they value the building because, as I’ll discuss below, the company has some questionable accounting practices.  In the instance of the office buildings in Los Angeles as an example, they valued the buildings at $16.5 million roughly 20 years ago and that figure has never been adjusted.  The result is that they are likely undervaluing the true value of their real estate holdings.  If we increase the value of these holding to $30 million, which seems like a fair appraisal for their buildings based on current market rate, this results in a total equity and asset value of $374 million.

Their liabilities consist of ~$60 million in deferred capital gains (0% interest), a $29.5 million margin loan (3% interest), and a $1.5 million mortgage (4% interest).  The deferred capital gains will not be paid anytime soon as Charlie Munger likes to hold stocks and when he sells, typically he will move into another qualified investment.  The margin loan was used to acquire businesses to build the Saas business and is serviced by the dividends from the bank stocks in the equity portfolio.  The mortgage is self explanatory.  Total liabilities amount to $91 million

Before jumping into the last portion of the Daily Journal’s business segment, I want to note that the Daily Journal has a market cap of $414 million.  As such, to reach its market cap valuation, assuming no value is assigned to the legal newspaper business (it has a value, it’s just not a high value and in all honesty, I don’t know what a fair value is for that business), the Journal Technologies business only needs to be worth $131 million to come a fair market value at its current market cap valuation.

---

Journal Technologies is the hidden gem of the Daily Journal.  It is a legal Saas business being sold to municipalities via the RFP process.  It is a case management system built off of a central e-Suites product that is then configured to meet the client’s needs.

It has a unique business model that results in, once again, an undervaluation of the company.  After being awarded an RFP, the company will then define the scope of the product, establish servers on site, and install its product, and then configure it to the clients needs.  All of this work takes 4 to 8 years to complete and during this time, the municipality is not billed.  On a relevant note to the questionable accounting practices above, the Daily Journal does not report the forthcoming revenue on its financial statements, thus these contracts have not necessarily been taken into account to determine the Daily Journal’s current market valuation.

When its e-Suites product goes live, the Daily Journal will charge an implementation fee and subsequently bill a licensing fee for the next 10 years (with built in price adjustments to account for inflation).  Currently, Daily Journal has over $100 million in forthcoming revenue which, due to their billing practices, is a very high-margin revenue once billing starts.  These contracts are found in the USA, Australia, Canada, and Tasmania currently, though more may have been signed and not discovered.  Credit to Matthew Peterson for taking the time to search across the web looking for tenders awarded to the Daily Journal, as there is not a central repository to identify these contracts.

Moving forward, the assumption is that the Daily Journal will continue onboarding new jurisdictions, there will be an increase in licenses purchased for existing contracts after e-Suites launches, consulting fees for upgrades and modifications will increase, and other e-solutions will be integrated with e-Suites to increase revenue (such as e-payment for fines and tickets).

While the Journal Technologies already has $30-some million in revenue, this figure will increase with time.  Additionally, these municipalities will likely continue using the e-Suite services once they go live after the time and cost of configuration, meaning revenue that is on the books today is revenue that will be on the books likely after the 10 years of licensing has expired.  Presently, Journal Technologies is a $200-$300 million business based on the figures and assumptions above.  Under this assumption, the Daily Journal is valued somewhere between $483 million and $583 million, meaning it is currently undervalued by 17% to 41%.

---

There are a few risks that need to be mentioned.  One is liquidity.  The Daily Journal has a $400 million dollar market cap and is too small for many large financial institutions to monitor.  It also has a $300 share price which, while irrelevant to value, will scare away many newer retail investors who invest $20 to $50 at a time.  Beyond these two issues, the Daily Journal has quite a bit of insider ownership or is owned by firms with long-term visions, thus they are not willing to sell shares on a daily basis.  The result is that only about 5,000 shares are traded on a daily basis.  This means that if you need to liquidate your position in a pinch, you may have to sell below the market rate.

The other glaring issue is age.  Charlie Munger is 97 years old and Gerald Salzman is 80 years old.  Beyond not being at the forefront of technological innovation on a personal level (some may view this as an issue when running a Saas business, personally I am not concerned as there job is to manage the people driving the Saas business), their old age means that in the coming years, their leadership may cease to exist.  No clear succession plan has been identified (this was raised during their last annual meeting by a concerned shareholder).  As management is a key strength within this business, this could be reason for pause for prospective shareholders.

Lastly, there is the $16 billion elephant in the room.  Tyler Technologies is their key competitor.  There are other smaller competitors who offer more limited solutions, but Tyler Technologies is the real competition in this space.  While their products are more modern and (likely) have better and flashier features, this is not necessarily what wins in RFP processes.  Instead, the Daily Journal’s practice of not charging the client until launch is a much more appealing catch for prospective clients.  While I’m sure Tyler Technologies will be a fine company in the long-term, its hard to argue that their fundamentals are nearly as attractive as the fundamentals of the Daily Journal.  The Daily Journal is valued at 8x sales, has a P/B of under 2, and has a P/E of 3.5.  By comparison, Tyler Technologies has a P/B of 8, is valued at 14x sales, and has a P/E of 91.  Tyler Technologies would need to continue growing at a very rapid pace to be a strong value investment (note that Tyler Technologies is still rapidly growing, though this rapid growth is slowing).  By comparison, the Daily Journal, if it continues at its current growth, is already a great investment.  As most clients are onboarded, growth is increasing and it is my belief that this will be a phenomenal investment.

I am posting this because after my research, I think others could benefit from investing in this company (if they agree with my above analysis) AND because I want community feedback on thoughts about DJCO.  My intention is to hold DJCO for a minimum of 4 years, though more realistically I will hold this for a very long time since, as I noted above, the revenue for this company is incredibly sticky and I believe they have many avenues to increase their sales.",nhspuq,(DJCO) My mini-essay investment thesis for The Daily Journal - Why you should buy a dying newspaper business
111,gyxx2ha,2021-05-21 13:37:27,t1_gyxx2ha,t1_gyxvw2j,investing,"No, I totally understand, I’ve just noticed a huge uptick in that sort of rhetoric regarding bitcoin in the last few months and it’s gotta be driven by some effort to change a narrative.  Of course lots of regular people who read it and don’t know any better get fooled which is a shame. 

What’s strange is I’ve been here for a while, enough to remember when BTC was under $100, and really all throughout then until maybe 2018 or so you’d see people talking about how it’s deflationary and that was a good thing - I think the discussion on how being deflationary makes it unfit for a mainline currency is a different topic, but at least everyone had the terms right.

Now, within the last few months that’s completely changed, I can’t sort out where it’s coming from but there’s a ton of people adopting this idea that inflation/deflation is a measure of supply and not purchasing power.  And that seems to drive them repeating that bitcoin is all of the sudden now inflationary, or disinflationary, but obviously that’s just mistaking what the words actually mean. 

Who knows where it’s coming from though.",,
112,gyxxi5l,2021-05-21 13:41:07,t1_gyxxi5l,t1_gyxkoo6,investing,">Actually the whole conversation above started with ""Bitcoin is still early in discovery.""

\- as a store of value, in relation to gold.

That you want to rephrase that whole conversation that bitcoin is not a store of value, has no practical use, isn't a store of value... is all on you.

&#x200B;

>Because no one claimed that bitcoin was an element. I still don't claim bitcoin is an element. People liken it to 'digital gold' generally, lazily perhaps. You're making strawman arguements.  
I mean you did, if you want to liken it to a digital product then compare it to digital products...

No I didn't. Show me where I claimed bitcoin was an element. You did. You made that strawman.

&#x200B;

>So you agree this software will likely not exist in it's current form in even 20 years? not exactly a good store of value...

It will evolve sure. But cease to exist? I think it'll still be around. Wether it's a good store of value or not is a completely different subject and I've neither argued for or against it.

&#x200B;

>These are collectables, you never claimed bitcoin was a collectable, are you saying bitcoin is a collectable? Because I'll agree with that, how you describe it, bitcoin sure does seem pretty useless.

Didn't claim it again. You asked me to justify it's price and I said it's driven by supply and demand like any tradeable asset. Again - trying to say things I didn't say. You seem to have more and more an issue with reading.

&#x200B;

>You mean fertilizer? it's used several orders of magnitude more than Bitcoin.

See horseshit comment.

&#x200B;

>Again, you can't just express a use, you need to explain why it's better than the competition that's already used by almost the entire population.

So now I need express a use AND why it's better. Well you're moving the goal posts. You're the one comparing it to banking in the first place. Or software. Or collectables.

Anything but gold is allowed apparently.

&#x200B;

>So to conclude, you have no expressed why a typical person would ever have a reason to use bitcoin or any crypto so that seems like you are talking a niche product. Doesn't seem like a good investment.

I don't need to because I never claimed it was. 

1) better than banking for a typical person - you created that narrative yourself.  I merely pointed out some uses to it other than investing, and 2) Never claimed it wasn't a niche product, what that has to do with anything I'm not sure. Plenty of niche products are good investments.

And what defines a good investment anyway? And does that differ from person to person - probably!

So to conclude. You can't read. You make up your own narrative. And Bitcoin can be compared to TikTok, or literally any software you want, oh, and banking. But not Gold.

The CFT classifies Bitcoin as a commodity. IRS classifies it as an asset. Man on internet claims it as a piece of software like social media.

I've had my serving of insufferable strawman crap on the internet today.

Because buy-side analysts work for institutional investors.  This tendency to set unrealistic price targets is not unique to Amazon.  It's endemic.

I've ignored financial news networks and buy-side analysts for 20 years, and for twenty years I've consistently beaten the market by focusing on one thing: steeply undervalued securities.

The only thing buy-side analyst targets tell me is what the rest of the market is likely to overpay for the stock I purchased at a discount to fair value... Real world example:

I purchased 1000 shares of Berkshire Class B common shares act $160.  I kept holding all 1000 until the the gap between current market price and the low consensus price target (vs. average or high target) started to narrow.  As the market price crossed the low price target I trimmed my position to 500 shares.",,

I tend to stay away from most of these not because of the dilution but because I have a hard time predicting future cash flows, but the upside if they can convert the growing revenues to free cash flow as Amazon and Facebook have is huge. In these cases you would want the dilution to be slowing as the company becomes more mature.

Some could say that is because it's building market cap. So if it's 'like gold, but better' imagine if anyone would convert their gold allocation to BTC over a short period of time. Massive outperformance. That massive outperformance would drive speculation. Speculation brings volatility. Until consolidation and very high market cap you would have volatility. 

I think is mostly because of uncertainty and speculation. Speculators are known to buy high and sell low, so it explains the price action. Uncertainty may bring some investor to sell it in fear of whatever. 

Consider that BTC exist since a decade. Gold, the classic inflation edge, has been a store of value for millennia and it went from 2200 down to 1700 in what? 6 months? Is that a store of value? Especially in the year with most M2 increase + fiscal stimulus ever in history?

>Why would buying later be a ""better way to deploy capital"" if your expectation in 2009 was that the price would go up?

It's all fine and well that you're picturing this in hindsight, but two things are important here:

1. In 2009, you would not know what the price in 2013 is going to be... so there's no basis by which you can tell me ""In 2009, I would have waited until 2013"".
2. Why are you picturing this as an either/or proposition?  My portfolio is always diversified by sector and asset class.

When I buy a security at well below fair value, it is always possible some other investment is out there, but I generally hold seven to 15 common stock positions, three or four preferred stock positions, sort and long term treasuries, corporate bonds, and at least 20% cash at any given time... So if the scenario arises that ""this other undervalued security popped up on the radar"" I'm likely to be holding both... and I might decide to rebalance them along the way.

None of that has anything to do with the fact that the $2.28 is a better price than $2.50 or $15... which was the sole point of that individual comment.

In the balance, the totality of my investing activities, and constantly leaving some cash available to avoid ever having to make an untimely sale at an unfavorable price, has yielded me a CAGR that beats the S&P.",,

Could easily have been a not great business already that was further impacted by the pandemic.

Ashford cut 95% of staff during the pandemic - https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ashford-hospitality-trust-hotel-executive-monty-bennett-layoff-furlough-95-percent-staff/

Given that this is a hotel REIT, hotel REITs were absolutely obliterated by the pandemic and are generally horrendously poor performers in any sort of economic downturn - many of them cut their dividend in 2008 entirely and many didn't bring back the div until years later. I'm not familiar with Ashford but I do see that they suggested in December that bankruptcy was a possibility. It's bounced recently with other hotel REITs as things have gotten somewhat better with travel.

I have a small stake (50 Shares) in a up and coming Cybersecurity company called Fortinet (FTNT). I nibbled here and there during the March 2020 crisis eventually having a cost basis of approximately 6800 dollars. The shares are now valued at just 10,300, up 55 percent.   


I recently re-balanced my portfolio away from re-opening stocks and play and consolidated to an VT index fund (215 shares) , Coinbase (25 Shares), FTNT and Churchill Capital (CCIV - 150 Shares). I have a stable job, ten thousand in savings, no debt other than a car note. The only area I would reinvest the profits would most likley be crypto or CCIV for the Lucid play.

The industrial revolution created the only time period in all of history characterized by **nominal** wage growth accompanied by a rapid expansion in supply which resulted in deflation.  The first part being the obvious reason why that period of deflation was entirely different than every single other one in recorded history.  Normally with deflation wages fall - the only reason they did not here was because of a one time unprecedented increase in production efficiency driving up production while simultaneously reducing costs and resulting in a need for higher skill(paid) employees.  

That is quite obviously not a normal condition, or one we would expect to persist - as it did not.

215,,2021-05-21 15:20:42,t3_nhv1rp,,investing,"PPE is becoming much more of a B2B industry, with businesses in need of face masks and other gear to keep operations running smoothly while restrictions are lifted for the general public. This is especially true in states like NY where restrictions are tighter than Miami. 

As the CDC loosens fask mask restrictions for vaccinated people, I’m seeing a ton of young people outside (maskless) in strict areas like NYC. The streets look like a Miami Spring Break - a whole gathering of young people in the streets in large numbers and no masks to be found. 

The big takeaway, however, is that masks are strictly enforced inside all establishments. Using restaurants as an example, customers must wear masks when they enter/exit and move around, but they are not required to wear masks when they eat. Most importantly, business employees MUST wear masks at all times, and will therefore go through masks at a much quicker pace. The business itself will have to provide PPE for their employees, leading me to conclude the future of COVID era PPE is B2B (in the US / EU and countries with access to vaccinations). 

What company is best situated to provide business with direct PPE supply? OPTEC International (OPTI) acquired WeShield - a B2B PPE supplier, with clients from Old Navy to Carl’s Jr. What led me to OPTEC and WeShield however, is an [article ](https://www.bkreader.com/2021/04/14/nyc-restaurants-gifted-free-ppe-through-new-partnership/)I found about their PPE donations to NYC restaurants through a partnership with the NYC Hospitality Alliance. It turns out the WeShield is run by fellow restaurant owners turned medical suppliers. In the article, a WeShield spokesperson said that the PPE cost of a restaurant is about $5-10 per employee, per day. 

The article also acknowledged that alleviating PPE costs for independent restaurants is what sparked their donation campaign. But without donations, $5-10 per employee per day really adds up and leaves us with a still emerging market of PPE buyers. Not just restaurants but all brick and mortar businesses are new customers in a space that was mostly used by healthcare organizations.

It will be interesting to see how the divide for public vs commercial PPE restrictions grows and which sectors maintain their status as large quantity PPE purchasers. For now, restaurants and retail locations have no plans on changing their PPE policies which leaves a niche market for suppliers like OPTEC.",nhv1rp,"Is supplying PPE directly to business the way forward for PPE providers in the US, EU?"

But you have not established a relation that makes us think bitcoin will last as long as gold. This is unfounded

> That you want to rephrase that whole conversation that bitcoin is not a store of value, has no practical use, isn't a store of value... is all on you.


No, i pointed out that it's not in early discovery and as we can see as a piece of tech running on the internet it's likely already 25-50% through it's lifecycle. We can also see that it's stupid to compare an element, something that has existed long before humans and something that will exist long after humans to man made software that won't even function in it's current state in a few decades from now.

>> Compared to gold where there's evidence of a gold/silver value ratio as far back as 3100 BC... I'd say twelve years is pretty early still.
>> No, my point is that it's still in ""early discovery""... especially when comparing it to Gold.

> No I didn't. Show me where I claimed bitcoin was an element. You did. You made that strawman.

You claimed bitcoin was like gold, golds value has always been because of its properties as an element. see quotes.


> It will evolve sure. But cease to exist? I think it'll still be around. Wether it's a good store of value or not is a completely different subject and I've neither argued for or against it.

You argued that bitcoin was a good store of value and that it would exceed a savings account when it comes to interest rates. You are now claiming the opposite.


> Didn't claim it again. You asked me to justify it's price and I said it's driven by supply and demand like any tradeable asset. Again - trying to say things I didn't say. You seem to have more and more an issue with reading.

Yes, because for assets with utility you can justify a price, we can justify a price for gold and for stocks. If you can't do that for bitcoin well that's interesting isn't it? This is literally the point of the subreddit.

> So now I need express a use AND why it's better. Well you're moving the goal posts. You're the one comparing it to banking in the first place. Or software. Or collectables.

I'm actually just asking you to answer my original question ""I'm a normal Canadian, why would I ever use bitcoin over my current bank?"" you are the one who decided to ignore that.

If you think it's not an alternative for banking you are welcome to identify different competitors and aswer the same question.


> Anything but gold is allowed apparently.

Well you can't use bitcoin like you use gold so that makes sense, you obviously don't think we are making bitcoin plated electronics right? This is because as an element gold has properties that make is valuable. 

> I don't need to because I never claimed it was.
> 1) better than banking for a typical person - you created that narrative yourself. I merely pointed out some uses to it other than investing, and 2) Never claimed it wasn't a niche product, what that has to do with anything I'm not sure. Plenty of niche products are good investments.

1) you actually didn't point out any uses other than investing that are better than the competition

2) ""Already stated, that those benefits don't appeal to you is your personal choice and I'm not here to change your mind. "" <-- that's you saying that if your few edge cases aren't appealing it's not worth using, ergo, niche product.



> And what defines a good investment anyway? And does that differ from person to person - probably!

A good investment is something that has value and/or generates value, things have value because of a combination of utility and scarcity. You have not demonstrated that bitcoin has value and you have not expressed why anyone should ever use bitcoin past to invest. If the only use of bitcoin is to invest then congrats, it's worthless as soon as you can't find a bigger idiot to buy it. Just ask yourself, if there were 0 other investors how would you make money?


> So to conclude. You can't read. You make up your own narrative. And Bitcoin can be compared to TikTok, or literally any software you want, oh, and banking. But not Gold.
 
Gold has value because it's shiny, anti bacterial, easy to mold, doesn't corrode and is conductive among other things. Even if no one invested in gold it would have value.

So for example can you express why bitcoin should be compared to gold instead of granite or a jpeg?


> The CFT classifies Bitcoin as a commodity. IRS classifies it as an asset. Man on internet claims it as a piece of software like social media.

You know all those social media companies are assets right? do you think companies aren't assets? weird..



> *closes reddit*

Of course you do, you can't express why anyone should use bitcoin or any cryptocurrency but ""numba go up! Better invest now before you miss out"", you're the exact type of person we don't need. Come back with some DD.",,

Disclosure I do not own any shares. 

I came across LOTZ in a stock screener as I had set a price target of $5 and noticed it got close to it.  To keep with the discipline of doing more research upon researching the 1st price target I dug deeper and did the following model.  

Summary
Carlotz is really a lead-gen tech business to help rental fleets and consumers sell directly to retail  vs. going through the auction process.  They eliminate the extra step and fees that is entailed in auction houses.  The company also allows consumers to sell their cars to other consumers with Carlotz being the ""broker"" that makes the process easy for both parties. 
The revenues are: flat fee from buyer, fee from seller (used to inspect, clean car and take pics), financing and insurance upsells and lease income.  

However, the company reports the total car sale as the revenue which is a bit funky but legal.  This is why the GROSS margins are 10% to 12%, if the Gross Margins were the ""revenues"" the company would only show a revenue of $35 million for 2021 vs. $350 million, kinda hard to sell a SPAC at a $1.4 billion valuation when the revenues are $35 but with eventual ""80% EBITDA margins"". 

I ran a 10 year model and do believe the company can become profitable by 2023 unless they keep expanding more aggressively than modeled but by 2024 they can grow organically using cash flow.  

I think the stock is a buy at $4 since at this price we have some downside protection of the cash on the balance sheet of around $2 and at that price you are only paying a 1x enterprise value to multiple multiple which is on the low side compared to historical of Carvana, KAR and others. 

Would I want to own this business forever?  No,  but I think it can go from $4 to $10 to $15 pretty quickly if the GROSS margins go to 13% to 15% as they originally projected in their investor presentation, however in my 10 year model I do not see 15% margins until 2030z Management has missed guidance on revenues for 2021 and margins and the street doubts they can meet their numbers for this year.  This is the risk and why I think it may trade lower in the short-term.  

2021 rev 330mm and 1x ev would be $4 and 2x ev is $8

2022 rev is 850mm and 1x ev is $8 and 2x would be $16

2023 rev would be $1.4 billion and 1x ev would be $12 and at 2x ev would be $24

The execution risk is will they be able to meet these revenue targets and go from the current 10% gross margins to the 13% they said they would be able to do on the Octoeber 2020 investor deck. 

It could eventually become a takeover target as we have now 5 to 10 companies in this space and companies are always looking for growth. 

Anyway interested to hear your thoughts on this. I can definitely go more granular into the business model but for simplicity sake kept it short.

Looking forward to your comments!",nhvsxl,$LOTZ is this bottom for Carlotz? Or do we go lower? I think worth $4 to $24 over a few years.

This is not true. Look at Florida. Theme parks don't require masks, big chain stores don't require masks. Businesses care about money and making masks mandatory will lower their customer base. Employees might wear masks longer, but it will eventually blow over and I can't imagine companies choosing to spend money on PPE that is not necessary for the job.

There are large risks in all financial assets, but the fact that crypto is its own thing, and is divorced from the real world has both good and bad elements, and its pretty clear its a real thing that is here to stay, even if crypto 2854 might go to zero, and probably will, because how many monies does the world really need ?",,
358,gyyv4v8,2021-05-21 17:54:20,t1_gyyv4v8,t3_nhnz2o,investing,"Hey guys, 24 y/o needing some help with future tax optimization. I was saving for a house, but due to recent life events realized I won't be buying anytime soon, and want to invest a good chunk of the down payment fund instead (around $10k-$15k). Outside of the down payment fund, I have a 6mo emergency fund, no debts, am already maxing my IRA, 401k, and I do not have an HSA (although will be getting one for 2022 and plan to max it out as well). My employer's 401k plan is not eligible for mega-backdoor-roth contributions, and I am unsure about future education expenses, so I'm not sure a 529 plan makes sense. I believe a taxable account is the only option that makes sense. I've already set one up with Vanguard, but have not bought anything yet.

I expect my expenses to rise in the next couple years, but still want to prioritize retirement accounts. If my expenses start to cut into my retirement savings, it would make sense to continue maxing out the retirement accounts for as long as possible, and sell in the taxable account to continue doing so (which effectively transfers money from the taxable account to a tax-protected account), correct?

If so, I stick to a 3 fund portfolio in my IRA and 401k, and was planning on doing that in the taxable account with mirrored allocations (maybe slightly more bonds in the taxable account, since I plan on using part of the taxable account to save for my next car purchase in ~10 yrs). However, after thinking more thoroughly about the wash-sale tax implications of that, would it make more sense to purchase one of Vanguard's target date funds instead? My thinking is:

Approach 1: Purchase VTSAX, VTIAX, and VBTLX in the taxable account. After a couple years, say VTSAX and VTIAX are both up $2k, but VBTLX is down $1k. If I sold then (to move that money to retirement accounts), I would have $4k in taxable gains, but the $1k that I could've claimed as losses counts as a wash sale, because I also buy VBTLX in my retirement accounts. So I am taxed on $4k of gains, since wash sales only apply to losses, not gains.

Approach 2: Purchase a Vanguard Target Date Fund that roughly mimics the allocation in Approach 1. Assuming the same gains/losses as above, I would have 1 fund with ~$3k in gains (as opposed to $4k gains and $1k losses). I still have the same amount of unrealized gains, but this approach reduces my taxable gains by $1k compared to the above approach, right?

Is approach 2 clearly the better strategy for taxes? Or is there something I'm getting wrong/not seeing that would make a better strategy? After I sell in the taxable account, could I just pause VBTLX purchases in my retirement accounts for ~30 days to avoid this? Or would simply holding VBTLX in the account have any effect on wash sale rules? Thanks.",,

I just finished listening to David Rosenberg on MacroVoices and he also still believes this inflation won't be anything more than transitory. He's been a deflationist as long as I've been listening to him, but he explains that we didn't have inflation with a 3.5% unemployment rate which was the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years. We didn't have inflation with trade wars, tariffs and protectionism or with tax cuts under Trump. We didn't get inflation under Ben Bernanke with any of the QE's...

If they couldn't hit their inflation average with the lowest unemployment numbers in 50 years, what makes you think that all of a sudden with an extra 7 million people unemployed there will be enough upwards wage pressure to sustain inflation? When this last round of stimulus checks is done and the extended unemployment benefits run out, all these people aren't going to be looking for work? Or do people think the government is going to be giving stimulus check after stimulus check? 

He contends that the inflation we're seeing now is a one time temporary inflation based on the reopening of the economy and supply constraints. We won't see sustained increases in the numbers for more than a few months.",,

The last point I'd make is one I mentioned back in December where Cathie advocated taking money off the table and/or keeping dry powder to buy dips in the future. Ark remains fully invested at all times, which probably makes sense if you're running a hyper growth fund. Yes, we know hyper growth has volatility and can bleed 30-40% in a few months; but conversely also tend to be the stocks that shoot up 30-40% in a few days based on some catalyst or other. Wouldn't it be foolish for someone running a hyper growth fund to miss a run in hyper growth because they decided to play defensive? As you mentioned from her past performance, she doesn't play defense on her gains and in the past that's led to trouble. It's definitely something to watch for.

Your last paragraph is the perfect caviat: Ark offers fully-invested, highly-volatile funds focused on long-term hypergrowth. It's up to the individual investor to use them effectively; whether it's buying puts for downside protection, selling CC's on the way up, or simply taking some profits every now and then. Putting 50% or more of one's portfolio into ARK requires either some extreme risk tolerance or some advanced risk mitigation tactics; but especially after a year of unprecedented outperformance, it's probably just a bad idea (performance chasing). In either case, I think the ARK story will become clearer over the next 2-5 years whether it's Janus 2.0 or an effective way of investing in the world of the future; probably turns out to be somewhere between the two.

Big market delusion is a great term. EV seems to have obviously been a big market delusion over the past couple months but has shaken out somewhat as the crappier spacs fall to $5-8 post merger.

CCIV pure speculation but idk, I've got some faith in the ""second-mover advantage"" with a CEO who has done all of this before.

Next: I have a few short positions. ARKK, ARKF and ARKG. More shares of the short than long because I am bearish in the short term and want to capitalize on my prediction. Once they dip some more, I will cover and reinvest all that profit back into my longs because I am bullish long term. 
_____
Options:

I have been using margin to sell weekly cash covered puts on TSLA for the past 6 weeks and have been collecting $250 a week. IV is close to 100% on the strikes so technically I’m IV-gang, but actually timevalue is high enough for the volatility of TSLA. Planning on continuing doing this. 

Then besides TSLA if there are fundamentally strong stocks that dipped 3-4 %, I like to sell weekly CSPs on those as well. So far it’s been AAPL, QQQ, SPY, MSFT. 

Total profit averaged each of the last 6 weeks from these is $300. Which to me is fantastic. 

Then I use this money to reinvest into my core - whoever/whenever dips. 

____

Conclusion / Strategy:

Core is sold when I retire. When core corrects, I buy more. Whenever the next black swan market crash occurs, core stays untouched. Don’t need the money and don’t care for short term tax. (Unless ofc my thesis in the fundamental of the stock changes, then I will plan to exit positions). 

Shorts/ Hedges: When any of my core positions start entering bubble-popping territory or are otherwise becoming overvalued, core stays untouched, but I will open small positions to short those core securities, and/or write calls andor buy puts. I hate buying puts but whatever makes most sense in that scenario. Once I’ve accumulated a “decent” amount, and I am no longer bearish, I close and reinvest back into the core. 

Options: I want to keep doing this every fuckin week man. $300 a week or even $200 a week is amazing money. That’s almost your entire food bill for a month. I invest typically 50% of each paycheck. And now I get to add more capital from these puts. And best of all, it’s mostly stress-free because I do choose strikes I am COMFORTABLE owning. I do need to migrate towards other stocks though besides blue chip tech.

Random thoughts:

-/ not trying to sound naive / nonchalant that it’s fully risk free. But then again I’m not chasing $10 premiums. I’m targeting the $2-$3 range. 

-/ sometimes when the premium is crappy , I’ll extend TDE but then exit early once I reach profit goal. And then I can sell more. 

-/ someone surely is going to ask why I’m selling naked puts on margin.  It’s naked because the cash is in the bank. It’s margin because I can spend more. I understand the risks and I have capital in the bank and I appreciate your thoughtful concerns :)

However, if you are not only estimating one slot machine. Instead, you are estimate the average rewards of one thousand slot machines (lets's assume they are independent for simplicity). Although you are not very confident on every single of them, you will be much more confident on the statistics over the one thousand machines. As the number of slot machines goes to infinity, your estimation error goes to zero. This is the most fundamental principle of probability theory.

1.  They could try to grow the business,  build a new factory or a new mine, or whatever. 
2. They could grow by buying another company 
Both of those could be good or bad, is there enough demand for the new factory to make it worth opening,  etc.
3.  They can give the money back to the shareholders by paying a dividend
4. They can give the money back by buying it's own stock. 

Buying stock benefits you because it can make the price go up (they buy from someone selling at the current price,  then the person selling a penny higher,  then the person selling a penny above that).  Though they try to spread it out by not buying all at once,  what they really want to do is reduce the number of shares.  The companies earnings are measured in amount of money per share or EPS.  For the same earnings with fewer shares the EPS is higher. 

Really your shares represents a claim or part ownership of the company.   To use an extreme example,  if you own one single share of a company with only 100 shares,  you owe 1/100 or 1% of the company.   If the company buys back 50 shares,  you would now own 1/50th or 2% of the company.  

Usually companies don't just do one of these,  they will use some money to buy back stock, and some to grow the business and sometimes pay some out as a dividend.  All depends on where they think the best use of the money is. If they choose poorly the shareholders sell, or elect a board that will fire the CEO.",,

Reason: max sharpe ratio is only one form of portfolio optimization. Sharpe ratio focuses on the max return of the ARITHMETIC mean over standard deviation of the portfolio, therefore may offer you an incomplete analysis. For example, a maximized sharpe ratio may not be the best choice if you’re also trying to find a maximized multivariate Kelly-style Optimization and in effect could lead you to blowing up your portfolio if choosing to use leverage.

A geometric analysis can be much more thorough and complimentary to your portfolio research because there is a heavier focus on compounded returns over time (ie. Nth root of the sum product of returns).

Start with a Markowitz optimization and move to different optimization methods (eg. CVaR, RP, etc.). 

Note 1: remember to use log returns
Note 2: correlation does not imply causation
Note 3: Markowitz Portfolio optimization is reliable such that it’s reproducible but might not valid/precise enough to optimize results in the short term

VTI / VXUS you can literally rebalance annually and roll along with it as your core holding... right now US is approx 66% of global equity markets.

If you make that combo your core holding, then it is easy to throw overweights on top of it with other ETFs...  Bull Markets in the final third tend to reward Mega Cap, consumer discretionary, and whatever sectors have won throughout the bull (tech, health care in this one). 

If you want to put real estate in there as an overweight, have at it.  gold is a commodity, i think general commodities are better diversification plan than just gold, but commodities are a crap shoot and don't give automatic inflation protection.

For example, for non-dividend stocks, you make your money through selling. If your company makes 1 dollar, and costs 100 dollars, it takes that 1 dollar and reinvests it, making their stock 101 dollars. For a dividend stock, you make your money when the company pays out a dividend - if they make 1 dollar and the share costs 100 dollars, they take that 1 dollar and give it to share holders but their stock stays at 100. So growth tends to be slower for dividend stock holders, but they receive the direct dividend. For non dividend, they make their money when they sell.

Going into more intricacies, technically in a tax-advantaged account, there is no real difference between dividend vs non dividend - you’re likely to see the same growth. The real issue comes down to taxable accounts where you get charged capital gains on dividends issued - even if it’s re-invested into the same security. So your growth would be slower, since you now have tax drag on dividend reinvestment, vs if the company just had reinvested the money.

Here’s a good argument on it - https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/dividends-are-not-exciting/. Others can probably do a better way of clarifying than me :)",,

There’s no hard-and-fast rule that a $100 stock that makes $1 EPS should necessarily become $101. I’ve seen companies announce earnings with no change in their stock price, or at least not commensurate with the earnings that were shared. Because price is more or less subject to whatever people are willing to say the price should be, I tend to be skeptical of rationales that say “the price will move by this particular amount.” The tax point is true though and it makes sense to me.

The best argument I’ve heard so far is that you buy these non-dividend-paying stocks in the hopes that they’ll be profitable enough in the future to one day start paying dividends (AAPL being a great example).",,

Have you ever heard of the Norwegian State Fund?  No?  Not only is it the largest fund in the world, but it is also considered one of the most cleverly managed.  He has built a huge fortune from virtually nothing through constant, low-risk investing.  His strategy has proven itself over various market cycles and can certainly be a blueprint for private investors.  But how exactly did this come about and what has the fund done right in the past?

The story began in the 1960s when oil was first found off the coast of Norway.  From the beginning, Norwegian politicians made it important that the inhabitants benefit from the wealth of raw materials: not only through sovereignty over mineral resources, but also through jobs.  The oil industry paid really well and pulled the wages of other industries with it.  In the medium term, this meant that inflation rose.

With the first oil price shock, the demand for Norwegian crude oil also fell.  Economic growth collapsed.  At the same time, the amount of foreign currency debt rose.

Norwegian politicians stuck to their long-term perspective.  They no longer wanted to make the Norwegian economy so dependent on oil and they also wanted to avoid the high export surpluses that had been common up until then, because that affected exchange rates and inflation.  That is why they came up with the idea of ​​completely investing the excess payments from oil exports abroad.  Quasi: Oil leaves the country, but the money received for it does not enter the Norwegian economic cycle.

The so-called oil fund came into being in the mid-1990s.  In this state-managed investment fund, the income from Norway's crude oil and natural gas sales is invested, all of the income, not just part of it.  The oil fund invests worldwide, long-term and according to ethical principles.  His goal is to provide for the financial future of all Norwegian residents if the income from oil and gas no longer flows at some point.

While private investors often act from the gut, the oil fund has clear rules and guidelines.  His goal is to invest the money optimally in the long term from a risk-return perspective.  Because the fund is responsible for the financial future of many generations to come.  Anyone can view the investments and results of the oil fund on the Internet at any time.  So there is great transparency.

The Norwegian Oil Fund is a low-risk, profitable investment in the future and can therefore serve as a role model for private investors.

Since 1998 the oil fund has grown to the equivalent of over one trillion euros.  This corresponds to a value of around 190,000 euros per inhabitant.

It's all about the right mix:

Since 1998, the oil fund has achieved an average gross return of a good six percent per year before costs, inflation and taxes.  The income fluctuates depending on the stock market situation: In some years there is even a minus, in others double-digit returns are recorded.  The fund invests very successfully in the long term.  But how exactly does it work?

The steady returns are possible because the oil fund diversifies its investments across different asset classes and across different industries and regions.

The three asset classes in which the oil fund invests are stocks, bonds and real estate.  Stocks fluctuate more than bonds, so they are riskier.  In return, they generate better returns.  Since the oil fund thinks long-term, it overweight equities, currently at around 70 percent.  Real estate is only a small addition.  The rest goes into bonds.  According to modern portfolio theory, those responsible expect the best risk-return ratio from this.  The proportion of stocks in relation to bonds and real estate is regularly checked and adjusted to the target - also known as rebalancing.

For equity investments, the oil fund is based on the FTSE Global All Cap.  This is a stock index that contains around 8,000 stocks from large, medium and small companies around the world.  However, the oil fund deviates somewhat: European stocks, for example, are overweight and US stocks are underweight.  In addition to individual regions, individual industries can also be overweighted or underweighted.  There is also a black list of companies that are not invested in for ethical reasons.  These include, for example, energy suppliers such as Tata Power, companies that partially or exclusively manufacture armaments such as Lockheed Martin, Honeywell International, Airbus, Boeing, or tobacco companies.

When it comes to bond investments, the oil fund has so far invested seventy percent in government bonds and thirty percent in corporate bonds.  However, since a company's stocks and bonds are often closely linked, it was recently decided to only invest in government bonds.

The Norwegian oil fund is therefore based on an optimized mix of asset classes: around two thirds of it consists of stocks, one third of bonds, and some real estate is also mixed in.

The compound interest effect increases the fund's return.  The longer the investment horizon, the more it exploits its advantages.  In the case of the oil fund, income from interest and dividends is now higher than the new deposits.

A look at the oil fund's portfolio:

You've just heard that the oil fund invests in stocks, bonds and real estate.

Let's start with the equity investments.  At the end of 2019, around 71 percent of the fund's assets were invested in stocks.  The focus is on North America, followed by Europe.  Africa brings up the rear with less than one percent.

The focus of equity investments is therefore on large, developed economies.  But stocks from less developed emerging countries, the so-called emerging markets, are also included.  The equity quota here is 11 percent, because the emerging markets promise higher returns in the long term than the established countries, but the risk is also higher.  Smaller companies are also overweighted because, similar to emerging market stocks, they generate more returns on average.

At the end of 2019, around 26 percent of the fund's assets were invested in bonds.  A little more than half of them were government bonds.  Similar to stocks, bonds focus on North America and Europe.  But other countries and currencies are also mixed in, for example bonds in Japanese yen, Mexican peso or Brazilian real have been taken out.  The share of emerging markets is nine percent.

The remaining 43 percent are currently corporate bonds and covered bonds such as Pfandbriefe or similarly secured bonds.  However, as I said, the portfolio of corporate bonds is to be reduced in the future in favor of government bonds.

The creditworthiness, i.e. the creditworthiness of the bond debtors, is consistently high: only two percent of the bonds fall into the speculative area.

The third asset class that the oil fund invests in is real estate.  At the end of 2019, the volume invested in real estate was just under three percent.  Here the fund concentrates on office, logistics and retail properties in top cities such as New York, London, Paris and Munich.

The five principles of the Norwegian investment strategy:

The fund managers of the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund have not come up with a magic formula, but instead follow a series of investment guidelines, guidelines and rules.  We have put together for you the five most important principles of the Norwegian investment strategy.

First, there is the principle of passivity: invest passively and close to the index, which saves time and money.  The less fees you pay, the more income is left for you.

Second, there is diversification: the more you spread your wealth across different asset classes, the lower your risk of loss.  So take some time at the beginning to plan your strategy.  With the right mix of stocks, bonds and possibly real estate, choose an investment mix that suits your available assets and risk appetite.  Diversify within these asset classes according to geographic aspects.  Invest in both developed and developing countries, and by company size.  Overweight both emerging market stocks and smaller company stocks.  This way you can take advantage of opportunities and at the same time distribute your risk better.  About once a year you should restore your target quotas, i.e. rebalance.

Thirdly, we have the long-term investment horizon: Those who invest long-term can take more risks and thus generate a higher return.  Even if you are already retired, you should keep an equity stake.  Buy and hold, that is, buy and leave it alone, is more effective than trying to constantly chase after new trends.

Fourth, you should pay attention to consistency: what oil is to Norway, is your labor to you.  Invest a fixed amount every month, depending on your income, not the market situation.  If you earn more, increase your standing order.  This is also a better way of offsetting inflation.

And fifth, ethics also count: Pay attention to ethically correct, sustainable investments.  Violations of human rights, heavy pollution, arms manufacture, tobacco products or serious corruption are taboo for the oil fund.  For your private consumption, you can go a step further and only buy from companies that manufacture their goods ethically.

In short: invest long-term, regularly, sustainably, also diversified and index-based, and overweight shares of small companies and emerging markets as a return boost.

Build your personal future fund: The three levers for building private wealth

Now that we have taken a close look at the Norwegian oil fund, let's take a very practical look at how you as a private investor can implement the Norwegian strategy.  We take care of the three sub-areas stocks, bonds and real estate in turn.  But first, a few basic ideas about investing.

As already mentioned, there will be around 190,000 euros in the fund for every Norwegian in 2021.  If you want to save such a sum, there are various adjusting screws.

First of all, there is your investment horizon.  Following the Norwegian model, it should be an investment period of at least ten to fifteen years.  Even if you are about to retire, that doesn't mean that you need your money in one fell swoop.  You can pay out a monthly amount from your future fund instead of saving it further, a kind of private supplementary pension.

The second adjustment screw is your monthly savings rate.  How Much Money Can You Save?  Can you reduce fixed costs, do without what is superfluous or consume more consciously in order to invest this money in your future fund?  Do you already have securities or reserves in a call money or savings account?  You can also invest this money in your future fund.  If you earn more, you should increase the savings rate, at least by the rate of inflation.  Conversely, if you become unemployed, for example, you can lower your savings rate.

The third adjustment screw, the return, can only be influenced indirectly, namely through your asset class mix.  In addition to your personal perception of risk, it also depends on your investment horizon.  As a rule of thumb, subtract your age from 100, the sum corresponds to the share quota.  While as a thirty-year-old you invest seventy percent of your money in stocks, as a seventy-year-old you lower your risk with an equity ratio of thirty percent.  Of course, this also reduces the return.

The result, your saved wealth, results from the interaction of these three levers: investment horizon, monthly savings rate and return.

If you want to reach a certain amount, then it is important to start as early as possible.  This is also due to the compound interest effect.  The higher your return and the longer your investment horizon, the less you have to invest monthly.


Build your personal future fund: bonds

Now let's get into the construction kit of your personal future fund.  Our first pillar is bonds.  What can we learn from the Norwegians here?

Although the oil fund also invests worldwide in bonds, we limit ourselves to the most important currencies.  Because of their lower yield, currency fluctuations have a greater impact on bonds.  However, this is not a problem insofar as countries outside the eurozone also issue bonds in euros.

The prices of bonds also fluctuate, depending on the creditworthiness of the issuer, the remaining term and the interest rate level.  The oil fund tries to minimize this risk by only investing in government bonds with a maximum term of ten years.

An ETF savings plan is particularly useful if you are not yet very familiar with the capital market or if you cannot invest a lot of money.  ETFs, short for Exchange Traded Funds, are so-called index funds.  They replicate an index one to one;  this passive structure lowers costs, which in turn increases your return on investment.  You will remember: The oil fund also invests in line with the index.

For a bond quota similar to the Norwegian model, you should have a single ETF with a remaining term of no more than ten years that invests in government bonds that are denominated in euros.  You can find corresponding products on the website justetf.com.  For example the SPDR Bloomberg Barclays 7-10 Year Euro Government Bond ETF (ISIN IE00BYSZ5Z42).  Of course, you can also take ETFs with other maturities or other country focuses outside the euro zone.  Take a close look at the countries and maturities in which the ETF invests.  You can find this information, for example, on finance portals or on the websites of the providers.  The names alone do not always allow conclusions to be drawn about the content.

When it comes to sustainability, bond ETFs don't have much to offer at the moment.  So far there are only a few so-called green bonds.  You could, for example, buy a German government bond directly or a single green bond.  Rebalancing, i.e. aligning with your originally planned mix of assets, is usually easier with ETFs.

For your first fund pillar, the following applies: Government bonds that are denominated in euros and can be spread around the world contribute to stability.

So if you like it simple, you can tick off the bond issue with a single ETF.  It's more complicated with stocks.  For this, the topic of sustainability comes into play more strongly.

Build your personal future fund: stocks

So what can we learn from the Norwegians about stocks?  ETFs are also recommended here, with a maximum of twelve different ones.  The amounts per ETF should not be too small, otherwise this can increase the transaction costs.

The Norwegian Oil Fund invests worldwide, and that is what you should aim for for your equity exposure.  The following breakdown is recommended: 80 percent of industrialized market shares, 80 percent of which in large caps and 20 percent in small caps.  The 80 percent share of industrialized countries is distributed geographically as follows: 44 percent in North America, 44 percent in Europe and 12 percent in Asia and Oceania.  The remaining 20 percent of the equity stake is invested in emerging markets.  However, no further distinction is made here according to company size or region, as the diversification would otherwise be too confusing.

Are you still looking through  With a 70 percent equity component, this means, for example: 28 percent shares large caps North America, 28 percent shares large caps Europe, 8 percent shares large caps Asia and Oceania, 7 percent shares small caps North America, 7 percent shares small caps Europe, 2 percent shares  Small caps Asia and Oceania, 20 percent equities in emerging markets.  With a different share of shares, you can calculate the odds yourself using the above specifications.

For equity ETFs, you should prefer replicating over synthetic ones.  Replicating ETFs actually buy the share packages that are available in the fund, weighted according to the index, while synthetic ETFs artificially replicate the index via swap transactions.

On justetf.com you can filter funds by country, company size and all sorts of other criteria in order to replicate your future fund based on the Norwegian model.  You are of course flexible with the number of ETFs, but with seven you can map the Norwegian portfolio quite well.  If you are still at the very beginning of your future fund, you can first approach the optimal composition with fewer ETFs.  For industrialized countries, for example, you could use the UBS MSCI World SRI (ISIN LU0629459743) and for emerging markets the iShares MSCI EM SRI (ISIN IE00BYVJRP78).

In the two ETFs mentioned, ethical and moral aspects are taken into account, as you can usually see from the abbreviations SRI for socially responsible investment or ESG for environmental social governance.  Sometimes the providers work with negative lists, sometimes they pursue a best-in-class approach.  The latter means that they only invest in the most exemplary companies in an industry, such as the oil giant Total.  The approaches are not yet perfect, but they are still an important step towards sustainable investing.

Globally diversified stocks should make up the main part of your future fund; their higher returns mean that currency fluctuations are less significant in the long term.

We have now ticked off the two most important asset classes, stocks and bonds.  The question of adding real estate remains.

Build your personal future fund: real estate

The third pillar makes it a little more difficult for us.  That is why we do not start with the question of how, but start much more fundamentally with the question: real estate, yes or no?

Why?  Well, the oil fund invests a maximum of seven percent of its assets in directly held commercial real estate in prime locations.  As a private investor, you can forget that.  Even if you want to implement the real estate quota in the form of owner-occupied residential property, you would have to be a multiple millionaire to catch up with the oil fund.

Basically, you should clarify for yourself whether you want to have a property you use yourself or not.  If your answer is yes, forget about the strategic real estate quota.  Just be aware that the money you put into a property cannot be invested in your future fund at the same time.  Think not only of possible increases in the value of your property, but also of ancillary purchase costs, maintenance costs and mortgage interest.  You will only know afterwards what you will use to generate a better return, the property or your future fund.

Alternatively, you can invest smaller amounts in real estate using real estate ETFs or REITs.  The latter is short for Real Estate Investment Trust, which are public companies that earn their money with real estate.  The specialty of REITs is that they distribute a large part of their profits.  As with other investments, you should reinvest this income in order to use the compound interest effect for you.  An example of a real estate ETF with a focus on “industrialized countries” is the iShares Developed Markets Property Yield ETF (ISIN IE00B1FZS350).

To put it in a nutshell: real estate is immobile.  Therefore, think carefully about whether and in what form real estate should be part of your future fund.

Okay, did you understand?  Then get started: Open an online account, set up a savings plan that corresponds to your desired risk-return mix, and make sure to rebalance at least once a year.  Then you too can get rich like Norway.


Too long, didn’t read:

Let's sum it up again: The Norwegian Oil Fund is investing its money in the future.  He only uses stocks, bonds and, to a small extent, real estate.  Its success is based on an optimal risk-return mix, low costs, a long-term perspective and the consideration of sustainability.  The fund is completely transparent: both its strategy and its individual investments can be viewed on the Internet.

This is exactly what you can take advantage of as a private investor.  In order to put together your personal future fund based on the Norwegian model, first decide on the mix of assets that is right for you.  Then find suitable ETFs and set up a monthly savings plan.  With a long-term investment horizon and annual rebalancing, your returns should ultimately be as successful as Norway’s oil.",ni2sjd,Invest like the Norwegian Oil Fund

Look how many companies went into manufacturing or distributing PPE. 

1. How quickly those companies went into PPE tells you how there are few barriers to entry. Yeah, some companies and individuals reaped big profits because there was such incredibly high demand - the pie was big enough for everyone.
2. The number of companies that entered shows you that there may be a ton of excess supply and production capacity. But let's say there's a new respiratory virus pandemic tomorrow. There may no longer be an excess, but the difference between supply and demand won't be like the first few months of COVID.

However, let's say you see a PPE company that, in late 2019, was trading for $20 a share. You assessed $20 was about the company's intrinsic value. During the height of COVID, the company went for $100 a share. Today, it's $12 a share because other investors freaked out about the end of COVID... and you assess nothing has changed in the company since the pre-COVID days. Then, it might be a good investment because it's trading for 40% below its intrinsic value. But I don't see many of those kinds of deals being available.",,

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

I'm currently avoiding financial institutions in the mortgage business that are trading near highs.  The mortgage defaults aren't reelected in the price.",,

I have been doing this for 5+ years in professional capacity and we build big research teams, pay high fees to axioma to get risk estimates, do implied alpha and add that as estimates and still its not robust.

Super simple example, I form SIRGLASS inc.  Its simply a bank account with $100 in it and it has 100 shares. I own all 100 shares. 

Lets say I sell you 1 share for $1 and pocket the dollar. So now you own 1% of $100. 

Lets say one year later we earn $1 in interest so the bank account has $101 inside it. This means now each share is worth 1% of 101 or $1.01. So lets say I declare a $0.01 dividend  and I pay you $0.01. Great you earn $0.01 ! But now the bank account only has $100 in it. Your 1% ownership now is no longer worth 1.01 but down to 1.00.

The dividend didn't create value. With out the dividend your share is worth $1.01. With the dividend your share is worth $100 and you get $.01 cash. Its the same thing.

More complex yes you really do own part of the company. It also means if the company is sold you have to get paid just as much as the other share holders. It also means the management, board of directors have a fiduciary duty to all share holders even minority ones.  Meaning take my company SIRGLASS inc , I own 99% of it, you own 1%. I can do \*almost\* anything because I have an controlling interest . However I could not for example screw you over. I couldn't for example say ""I am selling the company (worth $100) for $1 to my wife"" giving you $.01 and basically screwing you out of 0.99 this would break fiduciary duty and you could sue me and win.",,

1) *You* have to declare a 1c dividend for me to get it back. I feel like the 1c should be mine whether or not you want to give it bc am I not entitled to 1% of the profit? The choice should be mine whether I want to leave it with the company or take some/all of it

2) If I find someone who will buy my share for $4, then my share is worth $4 regardless of dividend or not. The worth is totally at the whims of the buyers. Whether or not anyone would buy it for $4 is a different matter - in our example here, we’re only dealing with cash whose value is more or less absolute. In actual cases, with more intangibles, some people may value a share at $4. Regardless, if someone is buying it for $4, the EPS didn’t actually affect much.

2. The fund changes leader last year to Nicolai Tangen, a bit of a scandal as he came with some ""baggage"". So far it looks like he will bring a more bullish rule than previous leader.
3. The strict rules damages the fund a bit since they often need to shed large amount of stock and lower there own price. Today it got 72 % and need to bring it down to 70 %, that's a huge amount when you own 1.5 % off the world stocks",,

Ali Baba, JD, Pinduoduo, Baidu - most high-quality Chinese companies are undervalued. I'd also add Niu to the list, might be a bit small for some, early in the growth stages.

Top-tier banks are still reasonably priced - JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley. Capital One and Discover Financial, still reasonably priced.

I'm torn on oil supermajors. Realistically they have 20-30 good years left before oil revenues decline substantially, and plenty of other companies are more like 5-10 years from bankruptcy with higher P/E multiples (mall REITs, department stores). I'd definitely expect higher 10-year returns than what you'd get in airlines, hotels, retail right now.

Fintech - Paypal and Square. Some others I'm on the fence about in terms of valuation.

788,gz012yi,2021-05-21 23:32:47,t1_gz012yi,t1_gyzx0lb,investing,"A few points

1. So my example was overly simplistic however, if a company has ""profits"" it can do a few things with it. If it paid out 100% of its cash flow to owners it could never expand. Also almost all companies have debt, especially newer companies lots of times they are highly leveraged (meaning they have a buch of debt); So with the profits they can do a few thing, like pay down debt, or they can use it to expand (buy a new factory, do more R&D) or they can pay it out back to share holders. ; remember when amazon was just an online book store? Imagine if amazon in 2000 was like ""Well this is it, we became an online book store and we did it. From now on we won't expand into new ventures we will just give all profits back to the share holders"", would that make amazon a better or worse company?
2. Well now this is a much more complex subject as you are 100% right and made a very insightful comment. Companies are not valued at what they are ""worth"" today, they are valued at what investors think they will be worth 5-10-20 years into the future. So the sky is the limit on valuations however there is always pretty much a floor. In very extreme cases the floor is basically the liquidation value of a company.  At some point if the stock becomes so low, someone will buy , even if its just to liquidate the company if they think they can make a profit.  In my dumb example of my company that was only a bank account. If the share price dropped to $98, someone could potentially just buy the company for $98 , then liquidate and make a quick $2 profit. 

Also I have used this example before. Imagine you had a friend who wanted to open a new bar/restaurant and it he needed 1 million to do so. You gave him 100k and got 10% owner ship. The restaurant opens and is a big hit and is profitable . You now own 10% of 1 restaurant. Now you could do a few things you could sit back and take profits or you could start opening new restaurants. Lets say you do that and over the next 10 years you open 10 new restaurants 

Now you no longer own 10% of 1 restaurant , in another view you own 1 full restaurant.

That has real value.",,

I am 34 years old and just started my account this year, I know that I am terribly late...but better late than never I suppose. I use M1 finance so my holdings are separated into pies. I have put the percentage the pie is in my portfolio and then the percentages of holdings within that pie. My main pie is ESG index ETFs. I know many people think they are a waste, but I like the holdings in these. The 2 Blackrock ETFs are new and so far tracking similar to most other broad index funds. I have a second pie with some value and speculative sector ETFs. Lastly, I have an individual stock pie. I am optimistic about psychedelics and other advancements for mental health. I am aware I have some overlap in my stocks and ETFs. I am open to trimming some ETFs or stocks. Anyway, just looking for some input. Thanks!

Disclaimer: I'm invested in IPOE (SPAC which will become SoFi). 

I moved everything over to SoFi, and would have preferred to just start there. I rather impulsively invested in IPOE but decided I might as well check it out, and now I've basically moved everything there (bank, credit, investment, student loan, no mortgage yet but if I had one I'd like having it there as well). 

I can't exactly describe it, but the way they synergize all your financial interests (even combining them in various clear ways, and monthly stats with ""ghost"" charts of previous months) makes me feel really good about investing in them and also recommending them as a platform. I believe they also just bought a bank. 

Anyhow, just beery rambles. You invest is totally fine but imo the ""chase credit + you invest on one webpage"" lost its appeal to me pretty quickly, especially given it's not even RH tier as far as clearly showing equity/return/daily stats. 

Tldr YouInvest is fine but dont overvalue having credit and investment on a single page. Check out SoFi, which coincidentally will tie in all your bank, credit, investment, loans better than chase/youinvest and in one spot",,

It would make more sense for each shareholder to decide how much they want their cut to be distributed amongst those 3 buckets - and the company execs can make a pitch for why certain buckets should be prioritized.

I wrote this from a US-centric perspective, but I did take some global considerations in one section. I welcome any missed risks, or critique of risks listed here.

&nbsp;
Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities Delinquency(CMBS)
----------------------

The 2008 crash was caused by Residential MBS default rate of 8%. While currently the overall 60+ day delinquency (behind in payments) rate is an average of ~4%, Hotels are ~16%, Malls are ~16%,  and retail space is ~9%.This poses a risk to destabilizing banks who may have to take a hit on the balance sheet as they try and recoup losses in settlement.  

“Fitch's delinquency index includes 928 loans ($20.8 billion) that are currently at least 60 days delinquent, in foreclosure, REO or considered nonperforming matured”

Source: https://www.fitchratings.com/research/structured-finance/us-cmbs-delinquencies-tick-up-in-april-for-first-time-since-october-2020-07-05-2021


Record Levels of Margin
--------------

Those investing in the stock market are currently running record levels of margin (847 billion) compared to the more moderate levels in years past (500b to 600b). This represents increase risk to destabilizing banks in the event that they are not able to recover the loans during a liquidation event. Examples of similar events affecting banks this year are Archegos and Greensill.

Source: https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest/advanced-investing/margin-statistics


Residential Forbearance Programs Ending
---------------------

Millions of evictions could be coming with the end of forbearance protections and the end of supplemental unemployment provisions. See source link. This could literally go exactly like 2008 again, destabilizing banks, etc etc.

Overnight Reverse Repo Deposits Increasing
---------------

There might be too much cash in the market, or there might be too much leverage and rehypothecation of treasury bills as collateral for margin. Depending on the reasons, creates some negative scenarios. Honestly this isn’t one I fully understand myself, but I’m marking it down as a potential risk. I’ve included a video that attempts to explain it.

Explanation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fttA-rNRYG4  
Source: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RRPONTSYD


Foreign Markets
------------

The 2008 crisis started in the US, but affected the world. It’s reasonable that an event in another market could be the straw that broke the US’s back. The EU sees similar economic risks that I’ve already raised. Service oriented countries (tourism, retail) are likely at higher risk of businesses becoming insolvent. There was a downtick in 2020 due to Covid slowing courts but it is likely to increase an unforeseeable amount in the future. Easing of economic support by the central bank could exacerbate this, causing loss of jobs and defaulting on the ever increasing debt of residential mortgages (apparently the housing prices are ballooning everywhere). Margin levels and the stock market as a bubble were inferred.

The collective information in this post
------------

If widely circulated, this post could cause enough people to liquidate their positions, triggering a domino of margin calls and liquidation of banks and/or hedge funds that are propped on epic levels of cheap cash.

Some things are dead obvious - where are your favorite places to shop now, how does that compare to 10 years ago? What tech devices does everyone have, what's the most popular brand for that device?

Also, exclude the last two paragraphs.  It's either overzealous to suggest that your post is going to cause a market panic, or purposely inciteful...  when you write a more cogent, thorough thesis with illustrative arguments and data points, skip the doomsaying hyperbole and connect the dots to the outcome the data support.",,

I’ve invested in about the same time frame,  I started in the early to mid 90’s. Through that time it was mostly S&P 500 funds and I didn’t really make a killer salary but invested 10 to 15% pretty steadily and my retirement portfolio is over 1.5M. Why do the Norwegians only get 190K?

I mean I’m assuming oil royalty’s are much higher per person then my salary most of that time. Also I had a few periods with no income due to job loss. I’m sure the oil kept pumping.

I’m just clarifying that most amateurs doing home mining with GPUs are mining ethereum or other shitcoins, because they’d lose money on bitcoin. Some very few hobbyists may choose to mine Bitcoin at a loss, but that wouldn’t create a shortage.

Also, 5 year old Bitcoin GPUs don’t contribute to a supply shortage today, if anything it would help alleviate the shortage because miners would be selling their old GPUs since they don’t drive a profit anymore.",,
