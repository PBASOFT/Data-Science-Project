It might be to their advantage to do so because they are able to profit off of the availability of COMEX -- but at what price?  
In other words, saving COMEX yet again may be becoming just too *expensive* for JPM's bean counters/risk managers.  
Or maybe they simply don't have the available unencumbered silver to do this with any longer.  
JPM and their billion ounce mountain of silver may be a paper tiger. 

&#x200B;

Lets dign in !

**Comex silver warehouse .... another 1,000,000 oz is OUT OF THE VAULT, 43,000,000 oz is gone since the silverbacks arrived. This time it is all HSBC bank. And what did big powerful JP Morgan do? Nothing!! Maybe all their silver eligible is spoken for.** 

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

The long story can be read in the links below.

I spoke to a sales rep at Tesla she says they haven't delivered any Model X or S this year and she doesn't think they will.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418.
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

However I was deep thinking, so I started digging.  We never recovered from the 08 crisis.  They just dropped interest rates and turned on the printer.  

Now in 11-12 I was a security guard for a company that made coins for the us mint/ tiff jewelry.  Gold was crazy 16-1700$ an once.  It’s gone up 150-200$ an oz in the decade where we printed more money than we have since our founding. 

What if the government knew they were fucked and told hedge funds to naked short everything till oblivion. 


Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there’s at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don’t have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.  

Apes look up academic papers from the 08 collapse and what’s going on now naked shorting is on the rise.  

It’s nuts

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

Inflation is gonna destroy non-asset holders. I’m a bit worried about discount retail (5 below, DG, Dollar Tree) holding up because the business models are predicated on selling commodities at a certain price point. If commodity prices skyrocket dollar tree especially is gonna have a tough time adjusting since literally everything in their store is a dollar. So I think the better bet is to buy the actual companies that create goods that the poor are capable of buying (since inflation will eradicate much of the middle class.) Vizio products would never be sold in one of these stores but they sell really cheap TVs with internet accessibility. They sell a really good product considering the price point. I check their books and it’s a profitable company that’s been improving margins that last two years. Pretty low market cap so I wouldn’t be shocked if a larger company sought to buy it in the future.

205,,2021-05-21 07:40:32,t3_nhmv7n,,wallstreetbets,"Ford is great value investment considering it will compete with TESLA for EV market - Most of bear case is ford debt and they are 100% wrong. Please read below article.

**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    
**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford’s finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford’s automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford’s $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford’s $160 billion debt load.

From old post:

1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

207,,2021-05-21 09:36:45,t3_nhoi3w,,wallstreetbets,"Virgin Galactic announced they have a test flight scheduled for tomorrow and the stock moved up by 14% yesterday. I’m overall bearish on this company, as founder Richard Branson and SPAC-backer Chamath Palihapitiya have both sold basically all of their shares. Cathie Woods doesn’t even own it for ARK. 

I want to buy puts in anticipation of a drop Monday, this seems like the most likely outcome to me. Whether the launch is a failure or people just sell the news after a big move, it seems unlikely that it continues to rally Monday. There’s a lot of bag holders who bought at $40-60 a couple months ago that would love to get out if it bounces which would theoretically limit its possible gains Monday. On the chance the test flight greatly exceeds expectations or there is another announcement included along side the test, the stock could fly however. I feel that this is a slim but non-zero possibility. Basically whichever way it moves, it’s going to move hard. June 4th options have an IV of 165% per thinkorswim. 

My question is whether I am better off buying straight puts on $SPCE or if I should buy some sort of call/put spread to hedge my downside in the event the stock continues to fly Monday. My main concern is making the right move and still getting IV crushed. I’m looking at 6/4/21 $20 puts, or a spread at the same strike and expiry. In your opinions, is that a smart move or is there something else I should be considering? I’m still relatively new to trading options. 

Thanks for your input!

I suspect Nokia will have a favorable win rate as others try to compete with ReefShark. Nokia’s AI-enabled chip ReefShark which is used to power Nokia’s 5G base stations made up 44% of 5G sales. ReefShark is on track to reach 70% of 5G sales by year’s end. ReefShark is Nokia’s most recent semiconductor that powers its 5G base stations.

The ReefShark chipset is smaller, decreasing the antenna size by half, which makes these base stations less bulky and obtrusive.

211,,2021-05-21 11:44:07,t3_nhqhhk,,wallstreetbets,"Explosive fires have started everywhere already. Stock markets are on fire and so are property markets, as well as bond and debt markets. The problem is that fires are initially explosive but always end up implosive. 

How predictable events are (and people). This is particularly true in the world economy. Empires come and go, economies boom and bust and new currencies come and without fail always go. All this happens with regularity. 

&#x200B;

 Everything really on fire :

 We have seen  about inflation running wild and it is not just happening in stocks. Property markets are literarily exploding, especially the high end. We see this all over the world and not just in the US. In the UK for example, HSBC stated that March saw the highest number of mortgages EVER issued. In Sweden properties sell for up to 40% above asking price in a frenzied bidding war and second hand leisure boats are in such demand that they cost virtually the same as a new boat. And if you want a new boat, there is none available until 2022. It also seems that people are desperate for company after the lockdowns as prices for puppies in the UK are up to 100% higher than last year.

 Yes, everything is really on fire as people are desperate to just spend, spend, spend after a year of lockdowns and restrictions. 

 AN ECONOMIC BUBBLE OF AIR

 Since air is free, governments can produce unlimited amounts of it. And without exception, gullible people want to believe that it is actually real money and not just empty air. The beauty for the government is that they can just produce and borrow trillions of dollars at ZERO cost. And by manipulating interest rates they can borrow this money also at virtually ZERO cost. 

 So first the government manufactures the money at no cost and then they pay NOTHING for the privilege of borrowing that money. 

 The money obviously creates massive bubbles in stocks, bonds, houses, used cars , boats, puppies and other massively overvalued investments and consumer items. 

 Just look at how, for example, the Dow has gone up **exponentially and parabolically** **in the last year in an historically unprecedented straight line.** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lnjdj8xvlg071.png?width=461&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a5b514632f262f311d158e14416251b98f6d00e

 

**US Federal Debt up 74X**  
**Total US debt up “only” 49X**  
**M2 Money Supply up 29X>**

**Debt to GDP 1971: 37% – 2021: 127%**

 Bubbles are called bubbles because they consist of air. And when bubbles become too big, they ALWAYS and without fail burst and implode. 

 Technically markets are giving very clear signals that THE END IS NIGH.

Whether that means days weeks or a few months, is totally irrelevant. We know that we are at the end of the most remarkable period in history in regards to money, investments and the economy.

 GOLD, SILVER AND WEALTH PRESERVATION

Gold  and Silver  have not at all reflected the massive creation of money in the last 50 years. That catchup phase is likely to start very soon based on both fundamentals and technicals. 

As regards securing your finances in periods of crisis, gold and silver have always been critical to hold.

 Everyone can afford some gold or silver. An ounce of silver is $28 and one gramme of gold is $50. So saving in precious metals will not only be very useful but essential at whatever level you can afford.

 The upside potential for gold and silver is multiples of the current prices and that is at today’s price levels. Higher inflation could take the metals to unfathomable heights.

213,,2021-05-21 12:45:14,t3_nhrmu8,,wallstreetbets,"FuboTV posted its Q1 results on the 11th. Seasonality in sports is obviously huge, with Q1 and Q2 being the worst periods of the season.

Consequently, there was always a sequential decline in the number of subscribers in Q1 and Q2 in 2019 and 2020. Typically between -8 and -9% sequentially. Given the amazing performance that was achieved in Q3 and Q4 last year, it was heavily expected that this Q1 would again see a decline in paid subscribers.

And then the results were published. For the first time in its history, Fubo delivered a sequential growth in paid subscribers and revenue in a Q1! The inflection point as been passed, the business momentum is stronger than the seasonality of sports. Looking ahead, with the Olympics, the soccer world cup qualifiers, the main leagues restarting everywhere, I expect massive growth in paid subscribers.

Now, onto the revenue side. The ARPU is approximately constant at around 69$/month since Q3 2020. The low seasonality of Q1 means that the relative share of ARPU due to the advertising is quite low compared to Q3 and Q4 last year. Which means that a great improvement of the subscription ARPU has been reached in Q1!

Now, when we'll go into Q3 and then Q4, with the absurd growth in number of subscribers and the massive gains from advertising, I'm expecting the ARPU to again grow. Expected advertising growth is 100% YOY.

And what happens when you combine massive subscribers and ARPU growth? You have massive results.

The cherries on the cake are:

1. Fubo betting which comes as a free version in Q3 and then paid version in Q4. It can be massive as Fubo will be the only player in the industry to control end to end the viewer/bettor experience.
2. International expansion, in Europe first probably, starting in 2022.
3. Accepting wagering in unconventional currencies.

Well, October seems the answer.

From Wiki: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_largest\_daily\_changes\_in\_the\_Dow\_Jones\_Industrial\_Average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_daily_changes_in_the_Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average)

I know, in the last week many talked about a possible future crash in the stock market, inflation and there is too much liquidity and bla bla bla. I am not here to say the next crash will occur this October or on any other date (I well know that correlation is not causation). I have no subtle purpose to share, it's just for the curiosity of this pattern.

p.s. Probably the cause is because October is my birthday.

I don't know if there is something to discuss this, but I would appreciate your opinions.

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes – well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you’ll double your money. This isn’t some wishy washy bullshit oh it’s going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it’s just a question of when. How can I be so sure? They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.

Should you trust me? Am I financial advisor – good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips. Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago? We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can’t lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist? What the fuck does that mean – fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill. Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn’t just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine – kind of a big deal. They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year. Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe – think FDA is going to delay?

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no. They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted. Added bonus – Pfizer’s big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also – or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain’t going cheap. They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner. Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn’t allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth. The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes – former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – not piece of shit pharma we have here. Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks. You don’t have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear. No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential? Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities – hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men’s lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself. Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant’s drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued. MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down - whatever could they do with that cash? $44 a share wouldn’t even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down. With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in – remember this isn’t some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them. And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can’t see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone. FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they’ve already approved in new indications like this one. Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point. It’s down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason. FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density – the solution: they will monitor bone density. That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on – doesn’t that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer. Even if they don’t Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs. Truly can’t fucking lose. so why is it trading so cheap? Well cause no one knows about it, and the upside is only written down in Japanese.",nhssad,Guaranteed Buyout and Doubling of Funds if grab Myovant (MYOV)

It was Congressionally mandated in the last stimulus bill and gave the government 180 days to release an unclassified report to the general public and a classified report to congress. We are approaching that time, and June/July could be a heavy shift in perspectives and R&D priorities. [Sen. Rubio's Comments](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ufo-reports-should-be-taken-seriously-rubio-says-11621245038) [WaPo Article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/03/23/ufo-report-covid-bill/)

These UAP’s exhibit unexplainable flight characteristics: near instantaneous acceleration, airplane/submersible hybrid characteristics, visual disappearance, odd acoustics, etc. Also, multiple “types” of craft have been observed. 

There are patents filed by the Navy for inertial mass reduction craft (basically creating a quantum vacuum around the craft to avoid air/water resistance; useful to go Mach 16+ in the atmosphere). Here’s the patent: [Triangular UAP Patent?](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10144532B2/en). Additionally, we have heard rumors (and they may just be rumors) of anti-gravity temporal displacement craft. These craft can accelerate by utilizing gravity waves, bend light through a gravity well (stealthy), and externally perceived time could be affected as well (think Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar) ([Gravity Wave Patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10322827B2/) ) This UAP sightings might be manned craft or something else, or a mixture of both. These patents could also be counter-espionage missions to throw foreign countries off true technological breakthroughs, but we do know there was a demo of the tech: [Navy acknowledging demo, but not production ready](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/37134/emails-show-navys-ufo-patents-went-through-significant-internal-review-resulted-in-a-demo)

Okay great, so what’s the play…

**Long-Raytheon ($RTX)** has the Advanced Targeting Forward Look Infrared Sensor, which can be utilized to track UAP’s. This technology has been out for over a decade. Additionally, Raytheon is the go-to company for research into lasers, targeted radiation, or proton beams (still no word on proton torpedoes). ([UFO Targeting Pod](https://sofrep.com/news/following-pentagon-admission-raytheon-touts-gear-ufo-spotter/))

**Long-Lockheed Martin ($LMT)** a major defense aerospace firm, which developed many prototypes over the years and is famous for the Skunkworks R&D lab. Former Senator Harry Reid believes Lockheed has UAP fragments in their possession ([UAP Fragments](https://deadline.com/2021/04/ufo-fragments-in-possession-lockheed-martin-says-harry-reid-1234748095/)). These fragments are believed to be made of an unknown metal/alloy, and potentially 3D printed at an atomic level.

**Long-Northrup Grumman ($NOC)** is a defense giant which developed the B-2 stealth bomber and is a contractor on multiple space infrastructure missions. They would be vital for advanced composites/metallurgy, advanced avionics, spaceflight, and tracking systems.

Additionally, we have no clear knowledge of where the Chinese and Russians are at with this technology. Maybe this is partly why we founded Space Force? This is a \~2 month play to see if we can get more decisive acknowledgement of the technology whether it is manned or alien, either way it could make for an interesting news summer.",nht2ep,The Alien Trade

Can't believe I'm gonna throw shade on a firm I used to love but they have REALLY gone down hill.  Don't feel like writing a wall of text but want to warn others who are thinking of switching into them so I'm just going to bullet point problems I've had.  If you are with them already and feel so-so about them... there are better options out there.  Moving money is a pain in the ass but it might be worth it.

**Issues I've had with them**

* Margin approval is like pulling teeth.  They want to grill you to death for like half an hour and slowly increase your options approval one step at a time (honestly some of those guys seem like idiots and I'm not sure how they got their certifications).  If they don't like exactly how you answer questions even as an experienced trader that's been doing it for a while, they will delay your application by up to 6 months before you can try again.  That hasn't happened to me fortunately but apparently they do that so I'm always very anxious talking to them.  I have $600k ish with them in all my accounts and my risk per trade is typically capped at $50-60k.  I tend to have extra cash if I need to average down or add something to hedge my position.  Never used margin even though I have it since it's required to do a lot of different trades.

* Frequent outages (especially at market open), error messages, slow to load in the browser portal.  Desktop platform ""StreetSmart"" is terrible IMO but I suppose that is a matter of taste.  They're portal option trading is otherwise aright, I've seen better and worse but nothing to write home about.

* $1k recently mysteriously disappeared in my account.  They were quick to correct it and apparently it's some ""very rare"" programming error but who the fuck knows for sure.  I'm sure a lot of retards out there don't even notice if money is ever missing.

* Finally, something that has always bothered me is that their execution doesn't seem that good.  With options especially +/- a couple pennies (or nickel for larger contracts) can actually make a huge difference on your P&L for a trade.  They are THE LEADER in PFOF revenue.  Fuck them.

Technical Analysis is absolute meaningless astrology unless the strategies and indicators used are statistically/quantitatively *proven to be meaningful*. There are a lot of articles being published (and even shared here) about TLRY's TA - ignore them. They have zero weight on Tilray's future. Most of these chart patterns, strategies, theories, ideas, etc. taught in traditional trading education come from early 1900's anecdotal theories, which were nothing more than early, primitive attempts to identify patterns in markets. But, this is a story and an explanation for another time.

**In-Depth MACD Explanation:**

Since it's a popular retail indicator, most of you probably already know what the Moving Average Converence/Divergence (MACD) is. However, it's usually not well understood. The MACD takes in three settings for Moving Averages (MA) and the two lines plotted on the indicator are calculated as so:

MACD Line: Short MA - Long MA

Signal Line: Signal MA of the MACD Line

This is actually an incredibly clever way of measuring momentum and trend-following. By taking the difference between two different MA periods, we get a second-derivative (i.e. acceleration). By default, the MACD is calculated an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and with period settings (12, 26, 9).

**So, onto TLRY's** ***potential*** **momentum shift:**

*Note that I said ""potential,"" because the land of quantitative/algorithmic trading is nothing more than a probability game developed through hypothesis testing.*

Today, TLRY experienced a MACD crossover with MACD settings (SMA, 28, 48, 32). Why these settings? Because I ran a statistical backtest on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and simulated over 140,000 settings in an attempt to find the best practical combination to signal price change over the next few days via MACD crossover (Fun fact: using a Simple Moving Average (SMA) *always* yields better results, no matter what symbol or asset class).

If I were to buy ever MACD (SMA, 28, 48, 32) crossover at the daily closing price and hold for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days, what would my results be? Here's the results for the SPY since 2003:

Positive mean returns and a high win frequency are significant, with the 1st day after buying being the most important. So, now that we've seen it's general significance in large-cap, what are the backtested results for TLRY? Well, it's tough because Tilray hasn't had a publicly traded stock for very long, so the sample size is insufficiently small. But, take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/6d1lvnx9hi071.png?width=1932&format=png&auto=webp&s=24595178d1e6e808074bd46a7e8ad6a8442b3e98

It still holds some significance with the positive means and win frequencies. But obviously with only 9 crossovers happening in TLRY's lifetime, we can't take these numbers and fit them to any model.

**So, using the most statistically effective MACD period settings, TLRY** ***may*** **be getting a shift in momentum here fairly soon!**

I understand that my initial claims for the (28, 48, 32) settings were only tested on the SPY, and Tilray isn't large-cap growth. There is still more testing and solidifying to do. BUT, I figured you apes who are still holding are continually waiting for a confirmation bias, so here you go :)",nhyj2a,Tilray (TLRY) MACD Momentum Shift - Quantitative TA

Edit: nice close at 19$

You probably havent heard about [The Lion Electric Company](https://thelionelectric.com/). Its because its only been 2 weeks since they are officially listed on both [NYSE](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy5d2/nyselev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [TSX](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy67g/tsxlev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). Before that, you could only buy the SPAC's stock Northern Genesis Acquisition. This is when I first bought most of my shares.

Basic infos about the stock:
- currently worth 19 U$D (+30% this week and its the highest ever with ticker LEV)
- Market Cap 3,5 billion USD


What does the Lion do? They do 100% electric trucks and busses.
And yes there is a lot of competition in the EV market, but not that much for trucks. Lion doesnt make cars, only trucks. They also already have orders from Amazon and scholar institution. 


What makes me think LEV is a buy



1. Lion is going to open a manufacturing facility in Illinois worth about $500M. The Illinois government is financing $70M for this. When full operational, the factory will be able to produce 20,000 vehicles per year. It will be the biggest of its kind in the US. Lion says they plan they start production in mid-2022. 



2. Lion is also opening a battery factory in Quebec (Canada). The government is financing 100M CAD (roughly 82M USD) to help them build it. This means that not only Lion will make 100% electric trucks, they will also produce their own batteries which they could potentially sell to other businesses in the future. But most important is that they wont have to buy it from another. 



3. Canada will no longer allow to sell new gasoline vehicles by 2035 (it doesnt concern used cars). This is in 15 years (only? Lol). But a lot of companies already started their transition to 100% EV. And all the state owned business will buy from a Canadian company, because thats how Canada works most of the time. All the school busses and normal busses have to be replaced, and we know they wont buy from a Chinese company when there is a Canadian one available. So its probably going to be Lion Electric. You should also note that some private companies like Loblaws are already transitioning to EV, they bought a lot of Tesla trucks recently. However, Lion's trucks are not only Canadian but also expected to be cheaper and good quality. 



4. Lion has clients
Amazon made a contract with Lion to buy 2,500 trucks over 5 years. But theres a downside: Lion is obliged to reserve 500 trucks per year for Amazon, while Amazon isnt obliged to actually buy them. It means that if the trucks quality is deceiptive, its possible Amazon would not buy them. This would of course be horrible for the stock.
But Amazon isnt the only big client: First Student bought 260 busses from Lion. It was announced this week, and I can still feel the +30% impact on my portfolio. Everyday LEV went higher than the previous one. 



5. LEV has a huge potential for long term profit. I personally think the stock could reach 25USD before the end of the year, but it could be even more. And when the Illinois facility will finally open, the stock should go higher than 30. If you look up the Northern Genesis stock history (the SPAC that merged with Lion 3 weeks ago), you will see the stock was at 30+ in January, but it fell with all the EV market. If you dont buy LEV this year, it might be too late. Of course the stock will be way higher in 5 years than now, but the more profit the better, right?



So in my opinion, you will make 100% to 300% within 3-4 years with this stock. But I am not an expert and you dont have to trust me. I trust myself and mostly trust The Lion Electric Company. I am already making small profit from this investment.


Have a good day and may your portfolio be green!",nhyn43,LEV: Lion Electric is the underdog

Now, there are two narratives if you are interested in buying SNDL stock. First is the bullish one that points to the ample cash on its balance sheet. As I noted in a previous article, SNDL is becoming like the Berkshire Hathaway of the marijuana industry. The company is investing and lending to several smaller marijuana companies. Also, it could expand into the U.S. adult-use market.


As for TLRY, it looks like a good marijuana company to buy from a business perspective. The company is a marijuana powerhouse with international operations and both medical and adult-use businesses. Also, count on the post-merger synergies and economies of scale to work for the new TLRY.



To sum it up, from a purely business perspective, you will bet on TLRY. However, if you are looking at betting on an investment vehicle that can capitalize on the troubles of some of the smaller marijuana companies, SNDL will fit the bill.",nhzt5b,"SNDL vs TLRY, comment your favorite"

* Industry consolidation is occurring due to shrinking margins and increased regulatory costs
   * Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act to encourage consumer lending

* Pandemic-driven demand sent total home sales to the highest since 2006

# Investment Thesis I: Established Leader in the Marketplace

LendingTree’s competitive advantages in the marketplace differentiate them from other loan or insurance comparison-shopping marketplaces.

* **Speed:** easy-use; apply for loans in minutes and lock-in rates
* **Convenience:** search and apply for quotes 24/7 from anywhere in the world
* **Competitive Rates:** average buyer saves $125-$163 per month for interest
   * LendingTree has saved refinanced borrowers the most in San Francisco, San Diego and Los Angeles with median savings of $80,211, $77,740 and $73,954 respectively
   * Even in cities with  refinancing savings like Detroit present median savings of $23,409

# Investment Thesis II: Insurance Growth

* The insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and the number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Refer to chart ‘Segment Revenue’
   * Insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Expected revenue growth of 30% + compared to 2Q2020
* Acquisitions of QuoteWizard in 4Q2018 and ValuePenguin in 1Q2019 allowed them to enhance their insurance products 
   * QuoteWizard – one of the largest insurance comparison marketplaces in the growing online insurance advertising market
      * This acquisition established LendingTree as a leading player in the online insurance advertising industry while also allowing them to diversify their financial services category
      * Significant portion of their revenue growth in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was driven by their insurance leads business from this acquisition 
   * ValuePenguin – personal finance website that offers consumers objective analysis on variety of financial topics from insurance to credit cards
      * This acquisition provided immense value to insurance carriers and agents through their high-quality content and SEO capability – allowing them further scale in the insurance space
* New Medicare category for insurance growth showed significant promise during their first open-enrollment period in the 4Q2020
   * Presents a significant opportunity for their insurance segment 

# Major Risks 

**Consumer Demand Risk –** a general increase in interest rates may affect the ability of LendingTree’s mortgage Network Partners to close loans which will translate to lower revenues for LendingTree and ultimately affect their financial position

**Interest Rate Risk –** The Federal Reserve is currently printing out more money in order to keep the markets afloat due to COVID-19. In the long-term, this will cause inflation and the decreasing value of the USD. To combat this, the Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates

# Final Thoughts

The positive industry outlook and the prospective insurance segment of LendingTree that has generated high growth YoY strengthen analysts’ recommendations to BUY. Given a stock price forecast projecting a median price target of $320 (60.7% upside) and a low-price target of $200 (0.5% upside), I believe this stock still has a low of room for growth as they continue to diversify its revenue streams and expanding their financial services. Furthermore, I’ve provided a chart of analyst recommendations retrieved from CNN Business that strengthens the recommendation to BUY.

&nbsp;

I opened a Fidelity account in late January to hop on the GME train. I gave them all my personal info, everything they asked for, all honestly. I trade for a month.

&nbsp;

Then one day I log in to make an important trade and it says my accounts have been closed. No notification, no warning, just closed my accounts out of nowhere. 

&nbsp;

I missed out on $10,000+ of profit on the RKT trade I was going to make. It doesn't even give a reason WHY they closed my accounts, and there is nothing you can do it address this issue on their website. YOU CAN'T EVEN WITHDRAW THE CASH YOU HAVE. THEY DISABLE THE CASH TRANSFER FEATURE, HOLDING YOUR MONEY HOSTAGE.

&nbsp;

I call (this is a month after the GME squeeze, everything should have calmed down) and I'm on hold for TWO FUCKING HOURS.

&nbsp;

I'm fucking livid. I demand to know why they closed my accounts, and they say they ""need more verification"" and they want me to fill out some IRS form or some shit with a bunch of personal info.

&nbsp;

What the fuck? I already gave them all my info, and I have an extremely unique name so it's not like my info conflicted with someone else. These shitbags closed my accounts out of nowhere without even bothering to send me an email about it, causing me to lose out of thousands of dollars. They've essentially stolen my money by making it impossible for me to withdraw, AND THEN they keep me on hold for two fucking hours. I demand they send my money back.

&nbsp;

Here's the best part. FIDELITY REFUSES TO GIVE ME BACK MY MONEY. They insist that I HAVE TO fill out a form with a bunch of info then wait an indeterminate amount of time before I'm even allowed to withdraw my own money.

&nbsp;

It's not until I start threatening to sue for theft and/or fraud that they send my money back to me.

&nbsp;

Fuck Fidelity. Shady, scumbag company. Don't use them.",,

Now in 11-12 I was a security guard for a company that made coins for the us mint/ tiff jewelry.  Gold was crazy 16-1700$ an once.  It’s gone up 150-200$ an oz in the decade where we printed more money than we have since our founding. 

What if the government knew they were fucked and told hedge funds to naked short everything till oblivion. 


Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there’s at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don’t have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.  

Apes look up academic papers from the 08 collapse and what’s going on now naked shorting is on the rise.

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

Inflation is gonna destroy non-asset holders. I’m a bit worried about discount retail (5 below, DG, Dollar Tree) holding up because the business models are predicated on selling commodities at a certain price point. If commodity prices skyrocket dollar tree especially is gonna have a tough time adjusting since literally everything in their store is a dollar. So I think the better bet is to buy the actual companies that create goods that the poor are capable of buying (since inflation will eradicate much of the middle class.) Vizio products would never be sold in one of these stores but they sell really cheap TVs with internet accessibility. They sell a really good product considering the price point. I check their books and it’s a profitable company that’s been improving margins that last two years. Pretty low market cap so I wouldn’t be shocked if a larger company sought to buy it in the future.

844,,2021-05-21 07:40:32,t3_nhmv7n,,wallstreetbets,"Ford is great value investment considering it will compete with TESLA for EV market - Most of bear case is ford debt and they are 100% wrong. Please read below article.

**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    
**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford’s finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford’s automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford’s $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford’s $160 billion debt load.

From old post:

1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

846,,2021-05-21 09:36:45,t3_nhoi3w,,wallstreetbets,"Virgin Galactic announced they have a test flight scheduled for tomorrow and the stock moved up by 14% yesterday. I’m overall bearish on this company, as founder Richard Branson and SPAC-backer Chamath Palihapitiya have both sold basically all of their shares. Cathie Woods doesn’t even own it for ARK. 

I want to buy puts in anticipation of a drop Monday, this seems like the most likely outcome to me. Whether the launch is a failure or people just sell the news after a big move, it seems unlikely that it continues to rally Monday. There’s a lot of bag holders who bought at $40-60 a couple months ago that would love to get out if it bounces which would theoretically limit its possible gains Monday. On the chance the test flight greatly exceeds expectations or there is another announcement included along side the test, the stock could fly however. I feel that this is a slim but non-zero possibility. Basically whichever way it moves, it’s going to move hard. June 4th options have an IV of 165% per thinkorswim. 

My question is whether I am better off buying straight puts on $SPCE or if I should buy some sort of call/put spread to hedge my downside in the event the stock continues to fly Monday. My main concern is making the right move and still getting IV crushed. I’m looking at 6/4/21 $20 puts, or a spread at the same strike and expiry. In your opinions, is that a smart move or is there something else I should be considering? I’m still relatively new to trading options. 

Thanks for your input!

ReefShark is on track to reach 70% of 5G sales by year’s end. ReefShark is Nokia’s most recent semiconductor that powers its 5G base stations.

The ReefShark chipset is smaller, decreasing the antenna size by half, which makes these base stations less bulky and obtrusive.

850,,2021-05-21 11:44:07,t3_nhqhhk,,wallstreetbets,"Explosive fires have started everywhere already. Stock markets are on fire and so are property markets, as well as bond and debt markets. The problem is that fires are initially explosive but always end up implosive. 

How predictable events are (and people). This is particularly true in the world economy. Empires come and go, economies boom and bust and new currencies come and without fail always go. All this happens with regularity. 

&#x200B;

 Everything really on fire :

 We have seen  about inflation running wild and it is not just happening in stocks. Property markets are literarily exploding, especially the high end. We see this all over the world and not just in the US. In the UK for example, HSBC stated that March saw the highest number of mortgages EVER issued. In Sweden properties sell for up to 40% above asking price in a frenzied bidding war and second hand leisure boats are in such demand that they cost virtually the same as a new boat. And if you want a new boat, there is none available until 2022. It also seems that people are desperate for company after the lockdowns as prices for puppies in the UK are up to 100% higher than last year.

 Yes, everything is really on fire as people are desperate to just spend, spend, spend after a year of lockdowns and restrictions. 

 AN ECONOMIC BUBBLE OF AIR

 Since air is free, governments can produce unlimited amounts of it. And without exception, gullible people want to believe that it is actually real money and not just empty air. The beauty for the government is that they can just produce and borrow trillions of dollars at ZERO cost. And by manipulating interest rates they can borrow this money also at virtually ZERO cost. 

 So first the government manufactures the money at no cost and then they pay NOTHING for the privilege of borrowing that money. 

 The money obviously creates massive bubbles in stocks, bonds, houses, used cars , boats, puppies and other massively overvalued investments and consumer items. 

 Just look at how, for example, the Dow has gone up **exponentially and parabolically** **in the last year in an historically unprecedented straight line.** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lnjdj8xvlg071.png?width=461&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a5b514632f262f311d158e14416251b98f6d00e

 

**US Federal Debt up 74X**  
**Total US debt up “only” 49X**  
**M2 Money Supply up 29X>**

**Debt to GDP 1971: 37% – 2021: 127%**

 Bubbles are called bubbles because they consist of air. And when bubbles become too big, they ALWAYS and without fail burst and implode. 

 Technically markets are giving very clear signals that THE END IS NIGH.

Whether that means days weeks or a few months, is totally irrelevant. We know that we are at the end of the most remarkable period in history in regards to money, investments and the economy.

 GOLD, SILVER AND WEALTH PRESERVATION

Gold  and Silver  have not at all reflected the massive creation of money in the last 50 years. That catchup phase is likely to start very soon based on both fundamentals and technicals. 

As regards securing your finances in periods of crisis, gold and silver have always been critical to hold.

 Everyone can afford some gold or silver. An ounce of silver is $28 and one gramme of gold is $50. So saving in precious metals will not only be very useful but essential at whatever level you can afford.

 The upside potential for gold and silver is multiples of the current prices and that is at today’s price levels. Higher inflation could take the metals to unfathomable heights.

852,,2021-05-21 12:45:14,t3_nhrmu8,,wallstreetbets,"FuboTV posted its Q1 results on the 11th. Seasonality in sports is obviously huge, with Q1 and Q2 being the worst periods of the season.

Consequently, there was always a sequential decline in the number of subscribers in Q1 and Q2 in 2019 and 2020. Typically between -8 and -9% sequentially. Given the amazing performance that was achieved in Q3 and Q4 last year, it was heavily expected that this Q1 would again see a decline in paid subscribers.

And then the results were published. For the first time in its history, Fubo delivered a sequential growth in paid subscribers and revenue in a Q1! The inflection point as been passed, the business momentum is stronger than the seasonality of sports. Looking ahead, with the Olympics, the soccer world cup qualifiers, the main leagues restarting everywhere, I expect massive growth in paid subscribers.

Now, onto the revenue side. The ARPU is approximately constant at around 69$/month since Q3 2020. The low seasonality of Q1 means that the relative share of ARPU due to the advertising is quite low compared to Q3 and Q4 last year. Which means that a great improvement of the subscription ARPU has been reached in Q1!

Now, when we'll go into Q3 and then Q4, with the absurd growth in number of subscribers and the massive gains from advertising, I'm expecting the ARPU to again grow. Expected advertising growth is 100% YOY.

And what happens when you combine massive subscribers and ARPU growth? You have massive results.

The cherries on the cake are:

1. Fubo betting which comes as a free version in Q3 and then paid version in Q4. It can be massive as Fubo will be the only player in the industry to control end to end the viewer/bettor experience.
2. International expansion, in Europe first probably, starting in 2022.

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes – well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you’ll double your money. This isn’t some wishy washy bullshit oh it’s going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it’s just a question of when. How can I be so sure? They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.

Should you trust me? Am I financial advisor – good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips. Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago? We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can’t lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist? What the fuck does that mean – fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill. Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn’t just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine – kind of a big deal. They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year. Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe – think FDA is going to delay?

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no. They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted. Added bonus – Pfizer’s big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also – or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain’t going cheap. They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner. Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn’t allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth. The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes – former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – not piece of shit pharma we have here. Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks. You don’t have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear. No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential? Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities – hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men’s lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself. Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant’s drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued. MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down - whatever could they do with that cash? $44 a share wouldn’t even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down. With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in – remember this isn’t some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them. And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can’t see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone. FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they’ve already approved in new indications like this one. Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point. It’s down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason. FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density – the solution: they will monitor bone density. That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on – doesn’t that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer. Even if they don’t Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs. Truly can’t fucking lose. so why is it trading so cheap?

It was Congressionally mandated in the last stimulus bill and gave the government 180 days to release an unclassified report to the general public and a classified report to congress. We are approaching that time, and June/July could be a heavy shift in perspectives and R&D priorities. [Sen.

These UAP’s exhibit unexplainable flight characteristics: near instantaneous acceleration, airplane/submersible hybrid characteristics, visual disappearance, odd acoustics, etc. Also, multiple “types” of craft have been observed. 

There are patents filed by the Navy for inertial mass reduction craft (basically creating a quantum vacuum around the craft to avoid air/water resistance; useful to go Mach 16+ in the atmosphere). Here’s the patent: [Triangular UAP Patent?](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10144532B2/en). Additionally, we have heard rumors (and they may just be rumors) of anti-gravity temporal displacement craft. These craft can accelerate by utilizing gravity waves, bend light through a gravity well (stealthy), and externally perceived time could be affected as well (think Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar) ([Gravity Wave Patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10322827B2/) ) This UAP sightings might be manned craft or something else, or a mixture of both. These patents could also be counter-espionage missions to throw foreign countries off true technological breakthroughs, but we do know there was a demo of the tech: [Navy acknowledging demo, but not production ready](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/37134/emails-show-navys-ufo-patents-went-through-significant-internal-review-resulted-in-a-demo)

Okay great, so what’s the play…

**Long-Raytheon ($RTX)** has the Advanced Targeting Forward Look Infrared Sensor, which can be utilized to track UAP’s. This technology has been out for over a decade. Additionally, Raytheon is the go-to company for research into lasers, targeted radiation, or proton beams (still no word on proton torpedoes). ([UFO Targeting Pod](https://sofrep.com/news/following-pentagon-admission-raytheon-touts-gear-ufo-spotter/))

**Long-Lockheed Martin ($LMT)** a major defense aerospace firm, which developed many prototypes over the years and is famous for the Skunkworks R&D lab. Former Senator Harry Reid believes Lockheed has UAP fragments in their possession ([UAP Fragments](https://deadline.com/2021/04/ufo-fragments-in-possession-lockheed-martin-says-harry-reid-1234748095/)). These fragments are believed to be made of an unknown metal/alloy, and potentially 3D printed at an atomic level.

**Long-Northrup Grumman ($NOC)** is a defense giant which developed the B-2 stealth bomber and is a contractor on multiple space infrastructure missions. They would be vital for advanced composites/metallurgy, advanced avionics, spaceflight, and tracking systems.

Additionally, we have no clear knowledge of where the Chinese and Russians are at with this technology. Maybe this is partly why we founded Space Force?

Can't believe I'm gonna throw shade on a firm I used to love but they have REALLY gone down hill.  Don't feel like writing a wall of text but want to warn others who are thinking of switching into them so I'm just going to bullet point problems I've had.  If you are with them already and feel so-so about them... there are better options out there.  Moving money is a pain in the ass but it might be worth it.

**Issues I've had with them**

* Margin approval is like pulling teeth.  They want to grill you to death for like half an hour and slowly increase your options approval one step at a time (honestly some of those guys seem like idiots and I'm not sure how they got their certifications).  If they don't like exactly how you answer questions even as an experienced trader that's been doing it for a while, they will delay your application by up to 6 months before you can try again.  That hasn't happened to me fortunately but apparently they do that so I'm always very anxious talking to them.  I have $600k ish with them in all my accounts and my risk per trade is typically capped at $50-60k.  I tend to have extra cash if I need to average down or add something to hedge my position.  Never used margin even though I have it since it's required to do a lot of different trades.

* Frequent outages (especially at market open), error messages, slow to load in the browser portal.  Desktop platform ""StreetSmart"" is terrible IMO but I suppose that is a matter of taste.  They're portal option trading is otherwise aright, I've seen better and worse but nothing to write home about.

* $1k recently mysteriously disappeared in my account.  They were quick to correct it and apparently it's some ""very rare"" programming error but who the fuck knows for sure.  I'm sure a lot of retards out there don't even notice if money is ever missing.

* Finally, something that has always bothered me is that their execution doesn't seem that good.  With options especially +/- a couple pennies (or nickel for larger contracts) can actually make a huge difference on your P&L for a trade.  They are THE LEADER in PFOF revenue.  Fuck them.

879,,2021-05-21 17:50:01,t3_nhyj2a,,wallstreetbets," **Before I talk Technical Analysis (TA), it is important to understand the following:**

Technical Analysis is absolute meaningless astrology unless the strategies and indicators used are statistically/quantitatively *proven to be meaningful*. There are a lot of articles being published (and even shared here) about TLRY's TA - ignore them. They have zero weight on Tilray's future. Most of these chart patterns, strategies, theories, ideas, etc. taught in traditional trading education come from early 1900's anecdotal theories, which were nothing more than early, primitive attempts to identify patterns in markets. But, this is a story and an explanation for another time.

**In-Depth MACD Explanation:**

Since it's a popular retail indicator, most of you probably already know what the Moving Average Converence/Divergence (MACD) is. However, it's usually not well understood. The MACD takes in three settings for Moving Averages (MA) and the two lines plotted on the indicator are calculated as so:

MACD Line: Short MA - Long MA

Signal Line: Signal MA of the MACD Line

This is actually an incredibly clever way of measuring momentum and trend-following. By taking the difference between two different MA periods, we get a second-derivative (i.e. acceleration). By default, the MACD is calculated an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and with period settings (12, 26, 9).

**So, onto TLRY's** ***potential*** **momentum shift:**

*Note that I said ""potential,"" because the land of quantitative/algorithmic trading is nothing more than a probability game developed through hypothesis testing.*

Today, TLRY experienced a MACD crossover with MACD settings (SMA, 28, 48, 32). Why these settings? Because I ran a statistical backtest on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and simulated over 140,000 settings in an attempt to find the best practical combination to signal price change over the next few days via MACD crossover (Fun fact: using a Simple Moving Average (SMA) *always* yields better results, no matter what symbol or asset class).

If I were to buy ever MACD (SMA, 28, 48, 32) crossover at the daily closing price and hold for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days, what would my results be? Here's the results for the SPY since 2003:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k8lmq168hi071.png?width=1885&format=png&auto=webp&s=1af5f7ce7e179b59a18a198aaab1447e6177afc8

Positive mean returns and a high win frequency are significant, with the 1st day after buying being the most important. So, now that we've seen it's general significance in large-cap, what are the backtested results for TLRY? Well, it's tough because Tilray hasn't had a publicly traded stock for very long, so the sample size is insufficiently small. But, take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/6d1lvnx9hi071.png?width=1932&format=png&auto=webp&s=24595178d1e6e808074bd46a7e8ad6a8442b3e98

It still holds some significance with the positive means and win frequencies. But obviously with only 9 crossovers happening in TLRY's lifetime, we can't take these numbers and fit them to any model.

**So, using the most statistically effective MACD period settings, TLRY** ***may*** **be getting a shift in momentum here fairly soon!**

I understand that my initial claims for the (28, 48, 32) settings were only tested on the SPY, and Tilray isn't large-cap growth. There is still more testing and solidifying to do.

Edit: nice close at 19$

You probably havent heard about [The Lion Electric Company](https://thelionelectric.com/). Its because its only been 2 weeks since they are officially listed on both [NYSE](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy5d2/nyselev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [TSX](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy67g/tsxlev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). Before that, you could only buy the SPAC's stock Northern Genesis Acquisition. This is when I first bought most of my shares.

Basic infos about the stock:
- currently worth 19 U$D (+30% this week and its the highest ever with ticker LEV)
- Market Cap 3,5 billion USD


What does the Lion do? They do 100% electric trucks and busses.
And yes there is a lot of competition in the EV market, but not that much for trucks. Lion doesnt make cars, only trucks. They also already have orders from Amazon and scholar institution. 


What makes me think LEV is a buy



1. Lion is going to open a manufacturing facility in Illinois worth about $500M. The Illinois government is financing $70M for this. When full operational, the factory will be able to produce 20,000 vehicles per year. It will be the biggest of its kind in the US. Lion says they plan they start production in mid-2022. 



2. Lion is also opening a battery factory in Quebec (Canada). The government is financing 100M CAD (roughly 82M USD) to help them build it. This means that not only Lion will make 100% electric trucks, they will also produce their own batteries which they could potentially sell to other businesses in the future. But most important is that they wont have to buy it from another. 



3. Canada will no longer allow to sell new gasoline vehicles by 2035 (it doesnt concern used cars). This is in 15 years (only? Lol). But a lot of companies already started their transition to 100% EV. And all the state owned business will buy from a Canadian company, because thats how Canada works most of the time. All the school busses and normal busses have to be replaced, and we know they wont buy from a Chinese company when there is a Canadian one available. So its probably going to be Lion Electric. You should also note that some private companies like Loblaws are already transitioning to EV, they bought a lot of Tesla trucks recently. However, Lion's trucks are not only Canadian but also expected to be cheaper and good quality. 



4. Lion has clients
Amazon made a contract with Lion to buy 2,500 trucks over 5 years. But theres a downside: Lion is obliged to reserve 500 trucks per year for Amazon, while Amazon isnt obliged to actually buy them. It means that if the trucks quality is deceiptive, its possible Amazon would not buy them. This would of course be horrible for the stock.
But Amazon isnt the only big client: First Student bought 260 busses from Lion. It was announced this week, and I can still feel the +30% impact on my portfolio. Everyday LEV went higher than the previous one. 



5. LEV has a huge potential for long term profit. I personally think the stock could reach 25USD before the end of the year, but it could be even more. And when the Illinois facility will finally open, the stock should go higher than 30. If you look up the Northern Genesis stock history (the SPAC that merged with Lion 3 weeks ago), you will see the stock was at 30+ in January, but it fell with all the EV market. If you dont buy LEV this year, it might be too late. Of course the stock will be way higher in 5 years than now, but the more profit the better, right?



So in my opinion, you will make 100% to 300% within 3-4 years with this stock. But I am not an expert and you dont have to trust me. I trust myself and mostly trust The Lion Electric Company. I am already making small profit from this investment.


Have a good day and may your portfolio be green!",nhyn43,LEV: Lion Electric is the underdog

Now, there are two narratives if you are interested in buying SNDL stock. First is the bullish one that points to the ample cash on its balance sheet. As I noted in a previous article, SNDL is becoming like the Berkshire Hathaway of the marijuana industry. The company is investing and lending to several smaller marijuana companies. Also, it could expand into the U.S. adult-use market.


As for TLRY, it looks like a good marijuana company to buy from a business perspective. The company is a marijuana powerhouse with international operations and both medical and adult-use businesses. Also, count on the post-merger synergies and economies of scale to work for the new TLRY.



To sum it up, from a purely business perspective, you will bet on TLRY. However, if you are looking at betting on an investment vehicle that can capitalize on the troubles of some of the smaller marijuana companies, SNDL will fit the bill.",nhzt5b,"SNDL vs TLRY, comment your favorite"

   * Suggests a positive outlook for the company as the price was bought above the price it was trading at then

# Industry Overview and Outlook

* Low-interest rates have fueled consumer demand for refinancing existing debt and access to new debt
* Industry consolidation is occurring due to shrinking margins and increased regulatory costs
   * Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act to encourage consumer lending

* Pandemic-driven demand sent total home sales to the highest since 2006

# Investment Thesis I: Established Leader in the Marketplace

LendingTree’s competitive advantages in the marketplace differentiate them from other loan or insurance comparison-shopping marketplaces.

* **Speed:** easy-use; apply for loans in minutes and lock-in rates
* **Convenience:** search and apply for quotes 24/7 from anywhere in the world
* **Competitive Rates:** average buyer saves $125-$163 per month for interest
   * LendingTree has saved refinanced borrowers the most in San Francisco, San Diego and Los Angeles with median savings of $80,211, $77,740 and $73,954 respectively
   * Even in cities with  refinancing savings like Detroit present median savings of $23,409

# Investment Thesis II: Insurance Growth

* The insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and the number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Refer to chart ‘Segment Revenue’
   * Insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Expected revenue growth of 30% + compared to 2Q2020
* Acquisitions of QuoteWizard in 4Q2018 and ValuePenguin in 1Q2019 allowed them to enhance their insurance products 
   * QuoteWizard – one of the largest insurance comparison marketplaces in the growing online insurance advertising market
      * This acquisition established LendingTree as a leading player in the online insurance advertising industry while also allowing them to diversify their financial services category
      * Significant portion of their revenue growth in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was driven by their insurance leads business from this acquisition 
   * ValuePenguin – personal finance website that offers consumers objective analysis on variety of financial topics from insurance to credit cards
      * This acquisition provided immense value to insurance carriers and agents through their high-quality content and SEO capability – allowing them further scale in the insurance space
* New Medicare category for insurance growth showed significant promise during their first open-enrollment period in the 4Q2020
   * Presents a significant opportunity for their insurance segment 

# Major Risks 

**Consumer Demand Risk –** a general increase in interest rates may affect the ability of LendingTree’s mortgage Network Partners to close loans which will translate to lower revenues for LendingTree and ultimately affect their financial position

**Interest Rate Risk –** The Federal Reserve is currently printing out more money in order to keep the markets afloat due to COVID-19. In the long-term, this will cause inflation and the decreasing value of the USD. To combat this, the Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates

# Final Thoughts

The positive industry outlook and the prospective insurance segment of LendingTree that has generated high growth YoY strengthen analysts’ recommendations to BUY. Given a stock price forecast projecting a median price target of $320 (60.7% upside) and a low-price target of $200 (0.5% upside), I believe this stock still has a low of room for growth as they continue to diversify its revenue streams and expanding their financial services. Furthermore, I’ve provided a chart of analyst recommendations retrieved from CNN Business that strengthens the recommendation to BUY.

Large open interest & volume on the June 18 expiration date, any reason why there's x10 times the normal open interest on the options expiring June 18? over 15M shares to cover options in the money as of today

GOLD is a good value company, with over 12B in revenue in 2020 & market cap is only 3.5x last year's revenue. Over 2B/yr in earnings the last 2 years & 5B in cash. Most of the business is in Gold mining 20% is in copper. Commodity prices keep climbing higher, so it's a good hedge for inflation.

For full disclosure I own several calls at the $20, $22, $23  expiring in June-Sept as well as shares of GOLD for the long to medium term. I'm no financial advisor and I'm likely wrong.

The stock has been seeing some resistance at $25 lately, but if the price of gold per ounce ($1881 currently) crosses the $1890... June is going to be a very good month for Barrick Gold. It's a quality company in my opinion & the market is at a tipping point, so it's a good safety net (maybe...)

However I was deep thinking, so I started digging.  We never recovered from the 08 crisis.  They just dropped interest rates and turned on the printer.  

Now in 11-12 I was a security guard for a company that made coins for the us mint/ tiff jewelry.  Gold was crazy 16-1700$ an once.  It’s gone up 150-200$ an oz in the decade where we printed more money than we have since our founding. 

What if the government knew they were fucked and told hedge funds to naked short everything till oblivion. 


Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there’s at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don’t have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.  

Apes look up academic papers from the 08 collapse and what’s going on now naked shorting is on the rise.  

It’s nuts

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

Inflation is gonna destroy non-asset holders. I’m a bit worried about discount retail (5 below, DG, Dollar Tree) holding up because the business models are predicated on selling commodities at a certain price point. If commodity prices skyrocket dollar tree especially is gonna have a tough time adjusting since literally everything in their store is a dollar. So I think the better bet is to buy the actual companies that create goods that the poor are capable of buying (since inflation will eradicate much of the middle class.) Vizio products would never be sold in one of these stores but they sell really cheap TVs with internet accessibility. They sell a really good product considering the price point. I check their books and it’s a profitable company that’s been improving margins that last two years. Pretty low market cap so I wouldn’t be shocked if a larger company sought to buy it in the future.

1152,,2021-05-21 07:40:32,t3_nhmv7n,,wallstreetbets,"Ford is great value investment considering it will compete with TESLA for EV market - Most of bear case is ford debt and they are 100% wrong. Please read below article.

**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    
**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford’s finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford’s automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford’s $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford’s $160 billion debt load.

From old post:

1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

1154,,2021-05-21 09:36:45,t3_nhoi3w,,wallstreetbets,"Virgin Galactic announced they have a test flight scheduled for tomorrow and the stock moved up by 14% yesterday. I’m overall bearish on this company, as founder Richard Branson and SPAC-backer Chamath Palihapitiya have both sold basically all of their shares. Cathie Woods doesn’t even own it for ARK. 

I want to buy puts in anticipation of a drop Monday, this seems like the most likely outcome to me. Whether the launch is a failure or people just sell the news after a big move, it seems unlikely that it continues to rally Monday. There’s a lot of bag holders who bought at $40-60 a couple months ago that would love to get out if it bounces which would theoretically limit its possible gains Monday. On the chance the test flight greatly exceeds expectations or there is another announcement included along side the test, the stock could fly however. I feel that this is a slim but non-zero possibility. Basically whichever way it moves, it’s going to move hard. June 4th options have an IV of 165% per thinkorswim. 

My question is whether I am better off buying straight puts on $SPCE or if I should buy some sort of call/put spread to hedge my downside in the event the stock continues to fly Monday. My main concern is making the right move and still getting IV crushed. I’m looking at 6/4/21 $20 puts, or a spread at the same strike and expiry. In your opinions, is that a smart move or is there something else I should be considering? I’m still relatively new to trading options. 

Thanks for your input!

ReefShark is on track to reach 70% of 5G sales by year’s end. ReefShark is Nokia’s most recent semiconductor that powers its 5G base stations.

The ReefShark chipset is smaller, decreasing the antenna size by half, which makes these base stations less bulky and obtrusive.

1158,,2021-05-21 11:44:07,t3_nhqhhk,,wallstreetbets,"Explosive fires have started everywhere already. Stock markets are on fire and so are property markets, as well as bond and debt markets. The problem is that fires are initially explosive but always end up implosive. 

How predictable events are (and people). This is particularly true in the world economy. Empires come and go, economies boom and bust and new currencies come and without fail always go. All this happens with regularity. 

&#x200B;

 Everything really on fire :

 We have seen  about inflation running wild and it is not just happening in stocks. Property markets are literarily exploding, especially the high end. We see this all over the world and not just in the US. In the UK for example, HSBC stated that March saw the highest number of mortgages EVER issued. In Sweden properties sell for up to 40% above asking price in a frenzied bidding war and second hand leisure boats are in such demand that they cost virtually the same as a new boat. And if you want a new boat, there is none available until 2022. It also seems that people are desperate for company after the lockdowns as prices for puppies in the UK are up to 100% higher than last year.

 Yes, everything is really on fire as people are desperate to just spend, spend, spend after a year of lockdowns and restrictions. 

 AN ECONOMIC BUBBLE OF AIR

 Since air is free, governments can produce unlimited amounts of it. And without exception, gullible people want to believe that it is actually real money and not just empty air. The beauty for the government is that they can just produce and borrow trillions of dollars at ZERO cost. And by manipulating interest rates they can borrow this money also at virtually ZERO cost. 

 So first the government manufactures the money at no cost and then they pay NOTHING for the privilege of borrowing that money. 

 The money obviously creates massive bubbles in stocks, bonds, houses, used cars , boats, puppies and other massively overvalued investments and consumer items. 

 Just look at how, for example, the Dow has gone up **exponentially and parabolically** **in the last year in an historically unprecedented straight line.** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lnjdj8xvlg071.png?width=461&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a5b514632f262f311d158e14416251b98f6d00e

 

**US Federal Debt up 74X**  
**Total US debt up “only” 49X**  
**M2 Money Supply up 29X>**

**Debt to GDP 1971: 37% – 2021: 127%**

 Bubbles are called bubbles because they consist of air. And when bubbles become too big, they ALWAYS and without fail burst and implode. 

 Technically markets are giving very clear signals that THE END IS NIGH.

Whether that means days weeks or a few months, is totally irrelevant. We know that we are at the end of the most remarkable period in history in regards to money, investments and the economy.

 GOLD, SILVER AND WEALTH PRESERVATION

Gold  and Silver  have not at all reflected the massive creation of money in the last 50 years. That catchup phase is likely to start very soon based on both fundamentals and technicals. 

As regards securing your finances in periods of crisis, gold and silver have always been critical to hold.

 Everyone can afford some gold or silver. An ounce of silver is $28 and one gramme of gold is $50. So saving in precious metals will not only be very useful but essential at whatever level you can afford.

 The upside potential for gold and silver is multiples of the current prices and that is at today’s price levels. Higher inflation could take the metals to unfathomable heights.

1160,,2021-05-21 12:45:14,t3_nhrmu8,,wallstreetbets,"FuboTV posted its Q1 results on the 11th. Seasonality in sports is obviously huge, with Q1 and Q2 being the worst periods of the season.

Consequently, there was always a sequential decline in the number of subscribers in Q1 and Q2 in 2019 and 2020. Typically between -8 and -9% sequentially. Given the amazing performance that was achieved in Q3 and Q4 last year, it was heavily expected that this Q1 would again see a decline in paid subscribers.

And then the results were published. For the first time in its history, Fubo delivered a sequential growth in paid subscribers and revenue in a Q1! The inflection point as been passed, the business momentum is stronger than the seasonality of sports. Looking ahead, with the Olympics, the soccer world cup qualifiers, the main leagues restarting everywhere, I expect massive growth in paid subscribers.

Now, onto the revenue side. The ARPU is approximately constant at around 69$/month since Q3 2020. The low seasonality of Q1 means that the relative share of ARPU due to the advertising is quite low compared to Q3 and Q4 last year. Which means that a great improvement of the subscription ARPU has been reached in Q1!

Now, when we'll go into Q3 and then Q4, with the absurd growth in number of subscribers and the massive gains from advertising, I'm expecting the ARPU to again grow. Expected advertising growth is 100% YOY.

And what happens when you combine massive subscribers and ARPU growth? You have massive results.

The cherries on the cake are:

1. Fubo betting which comes as a free version in Q3 and then paid version in Q4. It can be massive as Fubo will be the only player in the industry to control end to end the viewer/bettor experience.
2. International expansion, in Europe first probably, starting in 2022.

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes – well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you’ll double your money. This isn’t some wishy washy bullshit oh it’s going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it’s just a question of when. How can I be so sure? They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.

Should you trust me? Am I financial advisor – good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips. Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago? We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can’t lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist? What the fuck does that mean – fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill. Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn’t just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine – kind of a big deal. They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year. Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe – think FDA is going to delay?

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no. They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted. Added bonus – Pfizer’s big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also – or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain’t going cheap. They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner. Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn’t allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth. The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes – former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – not piece of shit pharma we have here. Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks. You don’t have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear. No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential? Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities – hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men’s lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself. Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant’s drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued. MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down - whatever could they do with that cash? $44 a share wouldn’t even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down. With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in – remember this isn’t some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them. And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can’t see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone. FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they’ve already approved in new indications like this one. Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point. It’s down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason. FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density – the solution: they will monitor bone density. That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on – doesn’t that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer. Even if they don’t Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs.

These UAP’s exhibit unexplainable flight characteristics: near instantaneous acceleration, airplane/submersible hybrid characteristics, visual disappearance, odd acoustics, etc. Also, multiple “types” of craft have been observed. 

There are patents filed by the Navy for inertial mass reduction craft (basically creating a quantum vacuum around the craft to avoid air/water resistance; useful to go Mach 16+ in the atmosphere). Here’s the patent: [Triangular UAP Patent?](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10144532B2/en). Additionally, we have heard rumors (and they may just be rumors) of anti-gravity temporal displacement craft. These craft can accelerate by utilizing gravity waves, bend light through a gravity well (stealthy), and externally perceived time could be affected as well (think Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar) ([Gravity Wave Patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10322827B2/) ) This UAP sightings might be manned craft or something else, or a mixture of both. These patents could also be counter-espionage missions to throw foreign countries off true technological breakthroughs, but we do know there was a demo of the tech: [Navy acknowledging demo, but not production ready](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/37134/emails-show-navys-ufo-patents-went-through-significant-internal-review-resulted-in-a-demo)

Okay great, so what’s the play…

**Long-Raytheon ($RTX)** has the Advanced Targeting Forward Look Infrared Sensor, which can be utilized to track UAP’s. This technology has been out for over a decade.

([UFO Targeting Pod](https://sofrep.com/news/following-pentagon-admission-raytheon-touts-gear-ufo-spotter/))

**Long-Lockheed Martin ($LMT)** a major defense aerospace firm, which developed many prototypes over the years and is famous for the Skunkworks R&D lab. Former Senator Harry Reid believes Lockheed has UAP fragments in their possession ([UAP Fragments](https://deadline.com/2021/04/ufo-fragments-in-possession-lockheed-martin-says-harry-reid-1234748095/)). These fragments are believed to be made of an unknown metal/alloy, and potentially 3D printed at an atomic level.

**Long-Northrup Grumman ($NOC)** is a defense giant which developed the B-2 stealth bomber and is a contractor on multiple space infrastructure missions. They would be vital for advanced composites/metallurgy, advanced avionics, spaceflight, and tracking systems.

Additionally, we have no clear knowledge of where the Chinese and Russians are at with this technology. Maybe this is partly why we founded Space Force?

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes – well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you’ll double your money.  This isn’t some wishy washy bullshit oh it’s going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it’s just a question of when.  How can I be so sure?  They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.  

Should you trust me?  Am I financial advisor – good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips.  Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago?  We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can’t lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist?  What the fuck does that mean – fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill.  Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.  

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn’t just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine – kind of a big deal.  They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year.  Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe – think FDA is going to delay? 

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Can't believe I'm gonna throw shade on a firm I used to love but they have REALLY gone down hill.  Don't feel like writing a wall of text but want to warn others who are thinking of switching into them so I'm just going to bullet point problems I've had.  If you are with them already and feel so-so about them... there are better options out there.  Moving money is a pain in the ass but it might be worth it.

**Issues I've had with them**

* Margin approval is like pulling teeth.  They want to grill you to death for like half an hour and slowly increase your options approval one step at a time (honestly some of those guys seem like idiots and I'm not sure how they got their certifications).  If they don't like exactly how you answer questions even as an experienced trader that's been doing it for a while, they will delay your application by up to 6 months before you can try again.  That hasn't happened to me fortunately but apparently they do that so I'm always very anxious talking to them.  I have $600k ish with them in all my accounts and my risk per trade is typically capped at $50-60k.  I tend to have extra cash if I need to average down or add something to hedge my position.  Never used margin even though I have it since it's required to do a lot of different trades.

* Frequent outages (especially at market open), error messages, slow to load in the browser portal.  Desktop platform ""StreetSmart"" is terrible IMO but I suppose that is a matter of taste.  They're portal option trading is otherwise aright, I've seen better and worse but nothing to write home about.

* $1k recently mysteriously disappeared in my account.  They were quick to correct it and apparently it's some ""very rare"" programming error but who the fuck knows for sure.  I'm sure a lot of retards out there don't even notice if money is ever missing.

* Finally, something that has always bothered me is that their execution doesn't seem that good.  With options especially +/- a couple pennies (or nickel for larger contracts) can actually make a huge difference on your P&L for a trade.  They are THE LEADER in PFOF revenue.  Fuck them.


When I joined them close to 20 years ago, I worshiped Charles Schwab.  You can google him but he was Good Guy broker when no one cared about retail back in the day.

1187,,2021-05-21 17:50:01,t3_nhyj2a,,wallstreetbets," **Before I talk Technical Analysis (TA), it is important to understand the following:**

Technical Analysis is absolute meaningless astrology unless the strategies and indicators used are statistically/quantitatively *proven to be meaningful*. There are a lot of articles being published (and even shared here) about TLRY's TA - ignore them. They have zero weight on Tilray's future. Most of these chart patterns, strategies, theories, ideas, etc. taught in traditional trading education come from early 1900's anecdotal theories, which were nothing more than early, primitive attempts to identify patterns in markets. But, this is a story and an explanation for another time.

**In-Depth MACD Explanation:**

Since it's a popular retail indicator, most of you probably already know what the Moving Average Converence/Divergence (MACD) is. However, it's usually not well understood. The MACD takes in three settings for Moving Averages (MA) and the two lines plotted on the indicator are calculated as so:

MACD Line: Short MA - Long MA

Signal Line: Signal MA of the MACD Line

This is actually an incredibly clever way of measuring momentum and trend-following. By taking the difference between two different MA periods, we get a second-derivative (i.e. acceleration). By default, the MACD is calculated an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and with period settings (12, 26, 9).

**So, onto TLRY's** ***potential*** **momentum shift:**

*Note that I said ""potential,"" because the land of quantitative/algorithmic trading is nothing more than a probability game developed through hypothesis testing.*

Today, TLRY experienced a MACD crossover with MACD settings (SMA, 28, 48, 32). Why these settings? Because I ran a statistical backtest on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and simulated over 140,000 settings in an attempt to find the best practical combination to signal price change over the next few days via MACD crossover (Fun fact: using a Simple Moving Average (SMA) *always* yields better results, no matter what symbol or asset class).

If I were to buy ever MACD (SMA, 28, 48, 32) crossover at the daily closing price and hold for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days, what would my results be? Here's the results for the SPY since 2003:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k8lmq168hi071.png?width=1885&format=png&auto=webp&s=1af5f7ce7e179b59a18a198aaab1447e6177afc8

Positive mean returns and a high win frequency are significant, with the 1st day after buying being the most important. So, now that we've seen it's general significance in large-cap, what are the backtested results for TLRY? Well, it's tough because Tilray hasn't had a publicly traded stock for very long, so the sample size is insufficiently small. But, take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/6d1lvnx9hi071.png?width=1932&format=png&auto=webp&s=24595178d1e6e808074bd46a7e8ad6a8442b3e98

It still holds some significance with the positive means and win frequencies. But obviously with only 9 crossovers happening in TLRY's lifetime, we can't take these numbers and fit them to any model.

**So, using the most statistically effective MACD period settings, TLRY** ***may*** **be getting a shift in momentum here fairly soon!**

I understand that my initial claims for the (28, 48, 32) settings were only tested on the SPY, and Tilray isn't large-cap growth. There is still more testing and solidifying to do. BUT, I figured you apes who are still holding are continually waiting for a confirmation bias, so here you go :)",nhyj2a,Tilray (TLRY) MACD Momentum Shift - Quantitative TA

You probably havent heard about [The Lion Electric Company](https://thelionelectric.com/). Its because its only been 2 weeks since they are officially listed on both [NYSE](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy5d2/nyselev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [TSX](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy67g/tsxlev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). Before that, you could only buy the SPAC's stock Northern Genesis Acquisition. This is when I first bought most of my shares.

Basic infos about the stock:
- currently worth 19 U$D (+30% this week and its the highest ever with ticker LEV)
- Market Cap 3,5 billion USD


What does the Lion do? They do 100% electric trucks and busses.
And yes there is a lot of competition in the EV market, but not that much for trucks. Lion doesnt make cars, only trucks. They also already have orders from Amazon and scholar institution. 


What makes me think LEV is a buy



1. Lion is going to open a manufacturing facility in Illinois worth about $500M. The Illinois government is financing $70M for this. When full operational, the factory will be able to produce 20,000 vehicles per year. It will be the biggest of its kind in the US. Lion says they plan they start production in mid-2022. 



2. Lion is also opening a battery factory in Quebec (Canada). The government is financing 100M CAD (roughly 82M USD) to help them build it. This means that not only Lion will make 100% electric trucks, they will also produce their own batteries which they could potentially sell to other businesses in the future. But most important is that they wont have to buy it from another. 



3. Canada will no longer allow to sell new gasoline vehicles by 2035 (it doesnt concern used cars). This is in 15 years (only? Lol). But a lot of companies already started their transition to 100% EV. And all the state owned business will buy from a Canadian company, because thats how Canada works most of the time. All the school busses and normal busses have to be replaced, and we know they wont buy from a Chinese company when there is a Canadian one available. So its probably going to be Lion Electric. You should also note that some private companies like Loblaws are already transitioning to EV, they bought a lot of Tesla trucks recently. However, Lion's trucks are not only Canadian but also expected to be cheaper and good quality. 



4. Lion has clients
Amazon made a contract with Lion to buy 2,500 trucks over 5 years. But theres a downside: Lion is obliged to reserve 500 trucks per year for Amazon, while Amazon isnt obliged to actually buy them. It means that if the trucks quality is deceiptive, its possible Amazon would not buy them. This would of course be horrible for the stock.
But Amazon isnt the only big client: First Student bought 260 busses from Lion. It was announced this week, and I can still feel the +30% impact on my portfolio. Everyday LEV went higher than the previous one. 



5. LEV has a huge potential for long term profit. I personally think the stock could reach 25USD before the end of the year, but it could be even more. And when the Illinois facility will finally open, the stock should go higher than 30. If you look up the Northern Genesis stock history (the SPAC that merged with Lion 3 weeks ago), you will see the stock was at 30+ in January, but it fell with all the EV market. If you dont buy LEV this year, it might be too late. Of course the stock will be way higher in 5 years than now, but the more profit the better, right?



So in my opinion, you will make 100% to 300% within 3-4 years with this stock. But I am not an expert and you dont have to trust me. I trust myself and mostly trust The Lion Electric Company. I am already making small profit from this investment.


Have a good day and may your portfolio be green!",nhyn43,LEV: Lion Electric is the underdog

Now, there are two narratives if you are interested in buying SNDL stock. First is the bullish one that points to the ample cash on its balance sheet. As I noted in a previous article, SNDL is becoming like the Berkshire Hathaway of the marijuana industry. The company is investing and lending to several smaller marijuana companies. Also, it could expand into the U.S. adult-use market.


As for TLRY, it looks like a good marijuana company to buy from a business perspective. The company is a marijuana powerhouse with international operations and both medical and adult-use businesses. Also, count on the post-merger synergies and economies of scale to work for the new TLRY.



To sum it up, from a purely business perspective, you will bet on TLRY. However, if you are looking at betting on an investment vehicle that can capitalize on the troubles of some of the smaller marijuana companies, SNDL will fit the bill.",nhzt5b,"SNDL vs TLRY, comment your favorite"

# Company Overview

**LendingTree (NASDAQ: TREE)** is America’s largest online marketplace connecting lenders and borrowers. LendingTree empowers lenders to shop for financial services the same way one would shop for hotel stays or airline tickets- comparing multiple offers from a nationwide network of over 800 partners that offer their customers services such as mortgage loans, mortgage refinances, auto loans, personal loans, business loans, and much more.

   * Nikko Asset Management Americas Inc. raised holdings by 15.4% during 4Q
* Insider Transactions:
   * Independent Director G. Thompson purchase 1.4M worth of share at about $282/share
   * Suggests a positive outlook for the company as the price was bought above the price it was trading at then

# Industry Overview and Outlook

* Low-interest rates have fueled consumer demand for refinancing existing debt and access to new debt
* Industry consolidation is occurring due to shrinking margins and increased regulatory costs
   * Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act to encourage consumer lending
* Strong economy coupled with strong employment numbers have led to a surge in home sales
   * Pandemic-drriven demand sent total home sales to the highest since 2006
   * 5.6% increase YoY for homes sold

* Projected $73.7B in loan origination for 2022

   * Approx. 79.3% growth since loan origination value of $41.4B from 2017
* Pandemic-driven demand sent total home sales to the highest since 2006

# Investment Thesis I: Established Leader in the Marketplace

LendingTree’s competitive advantages in the marketplace differentiate them from other loan or insurance comparison-shopping marketplaces.

* **Speed:** easy-use; apply for loans in minutes and lock-in rates
* **Convenience:** search and apply for quotes 24/7 from anywhere in the world
* **Competitive Rates:** average buyer saves $125-$163 per month for interest
   * LendingTree has saved refinanced borrowers the most in San Francisco, San Diego and Los Angeles with median savings of $80,211, $77,740 and $73,954 respectively
   * Even in cities with  refinancing savings like Detroit present median savings of $23,409

# Investment Thesis II: Insurance Growth

* The insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and the number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Refer to chart ‘Segment Revenue’
   * Insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Expected revenue growth of 30% + compared to 2Q2020
* Acquisitions of QuoteWizard in 4Q2018 and ValuePenguin in 1Q2019 allowed them to enhance their insurance products 
   * QuoteWizard – one of the largest insurance comparison marketplaces in the growing online insurance advertising market
      * This acquisition established LendingTree as a leading player in the online insurance advertising industry while also allowing them to diversify their financial services category
      * Significant portion of their revenue growth in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was driven by their insurance leads business from this acquisition 
   * ValuePenguin – personal finance website that offers consumers objective analysis on variety of financial topics from insurance to credit cards
      * This acquisition provided immense value to insurance carriers and agents through their high-quality content and SEO capability – allowing them further scale in the insurance space
* New Medicare category for insurance growth showed significant promise during their first open-enrollment period in the 4Q2020
   * Presents a significant opportunity for their insurance segment 

# Major Risks 

**Consumer Demand Risk –** a general increase in interest rates may affect the ability of LendingTree’s mortgage Network Partners to close loans which will translate to lower revenues for LendingTree and ultimately affect their financial position

**Interest Rate Risk –** The Federal Reserve is currently printing out more money in order to keep the markets afloat due to COVID-19. In the long-term, this will cause inflation and the decreasing value of the USD. To combat this, the Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates

# Final Thoughts

The positive industry outlook and the prospective insurance segment of LendingTree that has generated high growth YoY strengthen analysts’ recommendations to BUY. Given a stock price forecast projecting a median price target of $320 (60.7% upside) and a low-price target of $200 (0.5% upside), I believe this stock still has a low of room for growth as they continue to diversify its revenue streams and expanding their financial services. Furthermore, I’ve provided a chart of analyst recommendations retrieved from CNN Business that strengthens the recommendation to BUY.

Large open interest & volume on the June 18 expiration date, any reason why there's x10 times the normal open interest on the options expiring June 18? over 15M shares to cover options in the money as of today

GOLD is a good value company, with over 12B in revenue in 2020 & market cap is only 3.5x last year's revenue. Over 2B/yr in earnings the last 2 years & 5B in cash. Most of the business is in Gold mining 20% is in copper. Commodity prices keep climbing higher, so it's a good hedge for inflation.

For full disclosure I own several calls at the $20, $22, $23  expiring in June-Sept as well as shares of GOLD for the long to medium term. I'm no financial advisor and I'm likely wrong.

The stock has been seeing some resistance at $25 lately, but if the price of gold per ounce ($1881 currently) crosses the $1890... June is going to be a very good month for Barrick Gold. It's a quality company in my opinion & the market is at a tipping point, so it's a good safety net (maybe...)

If you're smart about it you can make an easy 7% daily return and if you're an idiot you might make 1%. The main dependency of whether it goes up or down depends on its Catalyst. Here's 1 week data on shorting Top Gainers. Read the whole post for the spreadsheet terminology to make full sense.

1 Week Spreadsheet of Shorting Top gainers:

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15H4gJJNRtfMae-umZnkWcDevsSE0ze9C91qFkDfX5zU/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15H4gJJNRtfMae-umZnkWcDevsSE0ze9C91qFkDfX5zU/edit?usp=sharing)

Resources Used:

Finviz Elite

Omni Average Calculator

Calculator Soup Percentage Change

**Important Info:**

Quality of Catalyst was purely subjective and decided upon before market open

All percentages assume equal amount of Shorts

For Tuesday N/A I counted it as the 10.32% in the column to its left in tabulation 5 day Average

All Stocks were top gainers at around 9:10-9:20

Green is returns, meaning the stock price fell

Red is Loss, which means stock price went up

**Profit% Av**\- Average Daily Return 

**Profit%<Av**\- Average Daily Return for Stocks with Average volume than Volume

**Profit%<Av****~~YY~~**\- Average Daily Return for Stocks with Average volume than Volume and no Amazing News

**Profit %Av YB/N**\- Average Daily Return for stock with Bad or No news

**Profit %<Av YB/N**\- Average Daily Return for Stocks with Average volume than Volume and No, or Bad news

**YB**\- Catalyst Bad for Stock

**YY**\- Catalyst Good For Stock

**Max**\- Average Individual Open to Low 

**Final Thoughts:**

Successful Clinical trials affect stock price more for treatment for Alzheimer and Cancer,  and less for conditions like Narcolepsy

V/Av V only matters if its very High

Even if you are the master of high speed trading, you won't get the max profit %

I haven't tried this on a non-paper account so I'm gonna try this with $1000 next week, so wish me luck

I have found 2 or 3 more shortable trends with higher daily returns and I will continue keeping tracking data for the next month, but my online High School workload is crazy so no guarantees

If you get rich off this strategy, at least name your Yacht after me

**TD:DR**\- If it goes up for no reason, it will probably go down.",ni535o,Shorting Pre Market Top Gainers- 1 Week Results

Then, New price target was raised to $10. Last week, it was raised again to $16 after AMC tackled more of it's debt thanks to the sell off and they're financial outlook improved. The point is, analyst themselves are baffled and you miss the point of AMC and other stocks like it on WSB. The stocks value is whatever the investor thinks it's worth until it's not. Or until the suits cockblock like they did back in January. Plain and simple. Don't misunderstand. I don't have my life savings in this lol. I have a very small stake, but only to show support to WSB. 

If you're on here to ""own"" me or ""troll"" me. You're doing it to the wrong person. Much less, you're in the wrong thread. You seem to belong in the comments section on YouTube Mad Money channel or other channels like it. If you haven't figured it out. People on WSB don't care if they lose money. Shit. I don't care. My small stake is meaningless and won't leave me in the poor house. Not by a long shot Lmao. So, take your analysis elsewhere. WSB has heard it all and has proven everyone wrong. Will it last. Maybe. Maybe not. One thing is true though, WSB has stirred pot and has gotten under people's skin. Frankly, I enjoy watching the suits and their supporters squirm.",,

From Youtube: ""YouTube’s right to monetize: YouTube has the right to monetize all content on the platform and ads may appear on videos from channels not in the YouTube Partner Program.""

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

TLDR; BIGC good, like SHOP, but undervalued.

Inflation is gonna destroy non-asset holders. I’m a bit worried about discount retail (5 below, DG, Dollar Tree) holding up because the business models are predicated on selling commodities at a certain price point. If commodity prices skyrocket dollar tree especially is gonna have a tough time adjusting since literally everything in their store is a dollar. So I think the better bet is to buy the actual companies that create goods that the poor are capable of buying (since inflation will eradicate much of the middle class.) Vizio products would never be sold in one of these stores but they sell really cheap TVs with internet accessibility. They sell a really good product considering the price point. I check their books and it’s a profitable company that’s been improving margins that last two years. Pretty low market cap so I wouldn’t be shocked if a larger company sought to buy it in the future.

1600,,2021-05-21 07:40:32,t3_nhmv7n,,wallstreetbets,"Ford is great value investment considering it will compete with TESLA for EV market - Most of bear case is ford debt and they are 100% wrong. Please read below article.

**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    
**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford’s finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford’s automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford’s $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford’s $160 billion debt load.

From old post:

1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

1602,,2021-05-21 09:36:45,t3_nhoi3w,,wallstreetbets,"Virgin Galactic announced they have a test flight scheduled for tomorrow and the stock moved up by 14% yesterday. I’m overall bearish on this company, as founder Richard Branson and SPAC-backer Chamath Palihapitiya have both sold basically all of their shares. Cathie Woods doesn’t even own it for ARK. 

I want to buy puts in anticipation of a drop Monday, this seems like the most likely outcome to me. Whether the launch is a failure or people just sell the news after a big move, it seems unlikely that it continues to rally Monday. There’s a lot of bag holders who bought at $40-60 a couple months ago that would love to get out if it bounces which would theoretically limit its possible gains Monday. On the chance the test flight greatly exceeds expectations or there is another announcement included along side the test, the stock could fly however. I feel that this is a slim but non-zero possibility. Basically whichever way it moves, it’s going to move hard. June 4th options have an IV of 165% per thinkorswim. 

My question is whether I am better off buying straight puts on $SPCE or if I should buy some sort of call/put spread to hedge my downside in the event the stock continues to fly Monday. My main concern is making the right move and still getting IV crushed. I’m looking at 6/4/21 $20 puts, or a spread at the same strike and expiry. In your opinions, is that a smart move or is there something else I should be considering? I’m still relatively new to trading options. 

Thanks for your input!

Huawei had won 91 global 5G contracts.

I suspect Nokia will have a favorable win rate as others try to compete with ReefShark. Nokia’s AI-enabled chip ReefShark which is used to power Nokia’s 5G base stations made up 44% of 5G sales. ReefShark is on track to reach 70% of 5G sales by year’s end. ReefShark is Nokia’s most recent semiconductor that powers its 5G base stations.

The ReefShark chipset is smaller, decreasing the antenna size by half, which makes these base stations less bulky and obtrusive. It helps enable a 50 – 60% reduction in energy use compared to previous chips. This lowers the total cost of ownership for wireless providers and it is a great selling point.",nhqc9p,Nokia succeeded in overtaking Huawei and Ericsson

How predictable events are (and people). This is particularly true in the world economy. Empires come and go, economies boom and bust and new currencies come and without fail always go. All this happens with regularity. 

&#x200B;

 Everything really on fire :

 We have seen  about inflation running wild and it is not just happening in stocks. Property markets are literarily exploding, especially the high end. We see this all over the world and not just in the US. In the UK for example, HSBC stated that March saw the highest number of mortgages EVER issued. In Sweden properties sell for up to 40% above asking price in a frenzied bidding war and second hand leisure boats are in such demand that they cost virtually the same as a new boat. And if you want a new boat, there is none available until 2022. It also seems that people are desperate for company after the lockdowns as prices for puppies in the UK are up to 100% higher than last year.

 Yes, everything is really on fire as people are desperate to just spend, spend, spend after a year of lockdowns and restrictions.

The beauty for the government is that they can just produce and borrow trillions of dollars at ZERO cost. And by manipulating interest rates they can borrow this money also at virtually ZERO cost. 

 So first the government manufactures the money at no cost and then they pay NOTHING for the privilege of borrowing that money. 

 The money obviously creates massive bubbles in stocks, bonds, houses, used cars , boats, puppies and other massively overvalued investments and consumer items. 

 Just look at how, for example, the Dow has gone up **exponentially and parabolically** **in the last year in an historically unprecedented straight line.**

**US Federal Debt up 74X**  
**Total US debt up “only” 49X**  
**M2 Money Supply up 29X>**

**Debt to GDP 1971: 37% – 2021: 127%**

 Bubbles are called bubbles because they consist of air. And when bubbles become too big, they ALWAYS and without fail burst and implode. 

 Technically markets are giving very clear signals that THE END IS NIGH.

Whether that means days weeks or a few months, is totally irrelevant. We know that we are at the end of the most remarkable period in history in regards to money, investments and the economy.

 GOLD, SILVER AND WEALTH PRESERVATION

Gold  and Silver  have not at all reflected the massive creation of money in the last 50 years. That catchup phase is likely to start very soon based on both fundamentals and technicals. 

As regards securing your finances in periods of crisis, gold and silver have always been critical to hold.

 Everyone can afford some gold or silver. An ounce of silver is $28 and one gramme of gold is $50. So saving in precious metals will not only be very useful but essential at whatever level you can afford.

 The upside potential for gold and silver is multiples of the current prices and that is at today’s price levels. Higher inflation could take the metals to unfathomable heights.

1608,,2021-05-21 12:45:14,t3_nhrmu8,,wallstreetbets,"FuboTV posted its Q1 results on the 11th. Seasonality in sports is obviously huge, with Q1 and Q2 being the worst periods of the season.

Consequently, there was always a sequential decline in the number of subscribers in Q1 and Q2 in 2019 and 2020. Typically between -8 and -9% sequentially. Given the amazing performance that was achieved in Q3 and Q4 last year, it was heavily expected that this Q1 would again see a decline in paid subscribers.

And then the results were published. For the first time in its history, Fubo delivered a sequential growth in paid subscribers and revenue in a Q1! The inflection point as been passed, the business momentum is stronger than the seasonality of sports. Looking ahead, with the Olympics, the soccer world cup qualifiers, the main leagues restarting everywhere, I expect massive growth in paid subscribers.

Now, onto the revenue side. The ARPU is approximately constant at around 69$/month since Q3 2020. The low seasonality of Q1 means that the relative share of ARPU due to the advertising is quite low compared to Q3 and Q4 last year. Which means that a great improvement of the subscription ARPU has been reached in Q1!

Now, when we'll go into Q3 and then Q4, with the absurd growth in number of subscribers and the massive gains from advertising, I'm expecting the ARPU to again grow. Expected advertising growth is 100% YOY.

And what happens when you combine massive subscribers and ARPU growth? You have massive results.

The cherries on the cake are:

1. Fubo betting which comes as a free version in Q3 and then paid version in Q4. It can be massive as Fubo will be the only player in the industry to control end to end the viewer/bettor experience.
2. International expansion, in Europe first probably, starting in 2022.
3. Accepting wagering in unconventional currencies.

* Expecting small moves today. Play tight and ITM 0dte if you're a degen.
* Bulls need to break 418 and test support. I think we top out at around 420 if 418 support holds.
* Bears need to break 414. I don't think we go below 410 tho but we shall see.

I am not here to say the next crash will occur this October or on any other date (I well know that correlation is not causation). I have no subtle purpose to share, it's just for the curiosity of this pattern.

p.s. Probably the cause is because October is my birthday.

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes – well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you’ll double your money. This isn’t some wishy washy bullshit oh it’s going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it’s just a question of when. How can I be so sure? They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.

Should you trust me? Am I financial advisor – good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips. Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago? We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can’t lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist? What the fuck does that mean – fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill. Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn’t just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine – kind of a big deal. They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year. Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe – think FDA is going to delay?

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no. They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted. Added bonus – Pfizer’s big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also – or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain’t going cheap. They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner. Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn’t allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth. The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes – former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – not piece of shit pharma we have here. Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks. You don’t have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear. No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential? Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities – hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men’s lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself. Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant’s drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued. MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down - whatever could they do with that cash? $44 a share wouldn’t even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down. With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in – remember this isn’t some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them. And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can’t see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone. FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they’ve already approved in new indications like this one. Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point. It’s down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason. FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density – the solution: they will monitor bone density. That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on – doesn’t that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer. Even if they don’t Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs. Truly can’t fucking lose. so why is it trading so cheap?

It was Congressionally mandated in the last stimulus bill and gave the government 180 days to release an unclassified report to the general public and a classified report to congress. We are approaching that time, and June/July could be a heavy shift in perspectives and R&D priorities. [Sen. Rubio's Comments](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ufo-reports-should-be-taken-seriously-rubio-says-11621245038) [WaPo Article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/03/23/ufo-report-covid-bill/)

These UAP’s exhibit unexplainable flight characteristics: near instantaneous acceleration, airplane/submersible hybrid characteristics, visual disappearance, odd acoustics, etc. Also, multiple “types” of craft have been observed. 

There are patents filed by the Navy for inertial mass reduction craft (basically creating a quantum vacuum around the craft to avoid air/water resistance; useful to go Mach 16+ in the atmosphere). Here’s the patent: [Triangular UAP Patent?](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10144532B2/en). Additionally, we have heard rumors (and they may just be rumors) of anti-gravity temporal displacement craft. These craft can accelerate by utilizing gravity waves, bend light through a gravity well (stealthy), and externally perceived time could be affected as well (think Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar) ([Gravity Wave Patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10322827B2/) ) This UAP sightings might be manned craft or something else, or a mixture of both. These patents could also be counter-espionage missions to throw foreign countries off true technological breakthroughs, but we do know there was a demo of the tech: [Navy acknowledging demo, but not production ready](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/37134/emails-show-navys-ufo-patents-went-through-significant-internal-review-resulted-in-a-demo)

Okay great, so what’s the play…

**Long-Raytheon ($RTX)** has the Advanced Targeting Forward Look Infrared Sensor, which can be utilized to track UAP’s. This technology has been out for over a decade. Additionally, Raytheon is the go-to company for research into lasers, targeted radiation, or proton beams (still no word on proton torpedoes). ([UFO Targeting Pod](https://sofrep.com/news/following-pentagon-admission-raytheon-touts-gear-ufo-spotter/))

**Long-Lockheed Martin ($LMT)** a major defense aerospace firm, which developed many prototypes over the years and is famous for the Skunkworks R&D lab. Former Senator Harry Reid believes Lockheed has UAP fragments in their possession ([UAP Fragments](https://deadline.com/2021/04/ufo-fragments-in-possession-lockheed-martin-says-harry-reid-1234748095/)). These fragments are believed to be made of an unknown metal/alloy, and potentially 3D printed at an atomic level.

**Long-Northrup Grumman ($NOC)** is a defense giant which developed the B-2 stealth bomber and is a contractor on multiple space infrastructure missions. They would be vital for advanced composites/metallurgy, advanced avionics, spaceflight, and tracking systems.

Additionally, we have no clear knowledge of where the Chinese and Russians are at with this technology. Maybe this is partly why we founded Space Force? This is a \~2 month play to see if we can get more decisive acknowledgement of the technology whether it is manned or alien, either way it could make for an interesting news summer.",nht2ep,The Alien Trade

Can't believe I'm gonna throw shade on a firm I used to love but they have REALLY gone down hill.  Don't feel like writing a wall of text but want to warn others who are thinking of switching into them so I'm just going to bullet point problems I've had.  If you are with them already and feel so-so about them... there are better options out there.  Moving money is a pain in the ass but it might be worth it.

**Issues I've had with them**

* Margin approval is like pulling teeth.  They want to grill you to death for like half an hour and slowly increase your options approval one step at a time (honestly some of those guys seem like idiots and I'm not sure how they got their certifications).  If they don't like exactly how you answer questions even as an experienced trader that's been doing it for a while, they will delay your application by up to 6 months before you can try again.  That hasn't happened to me fortunately but apparently they do that so I'm always very anxious talking to them.  I have $600k ish with them in all my accounts and my risk per trade is typically capped at $50-60k.  I tend to have extra cash if I need to average down or add something to hedge my position.  Never used margin even though I have it since it's required to do a lot of different trades.

* Frequent outages (especially at market open), error messages, slow to load in the browser portal.  Desktop platform ""StreetSmart"" is terrible IMO but I suppose that is a matter of taste.  They're portal option trading is otherwise aright, I've seen better and worse but nothing to write home about.

* $1k recently mysteriously disappeared in my account.  They were quick to correct it and apparently it's some ""very rare"" programming error but who the fuck knows for sure.  I'm sure a lot of retards out there don't even notice if money is ever missing.

* Finally, something that has always bothered me is that their execution doesn't seem that good.  With options especially +/- a couple pennies (or nickel for larger contracts) can actually make a huge difference on your P&L for a trade.  They are THE LEADER in PFOF revenue.  Fuck them.


When I joined them close to 20 years ago, I worshiped Charles Schwab.  You can google him but he was Good Guy broker when no one cared about retail back in the day.

3. Unsuccessful test flight

1635,,2021-05-21 17:50:01,t3_nhyj2a,,wallstreetbets," **Before I talk Technical Analysis (TA), it is important to understand the following:**

Technical Analysis is absolute meaningless astrology unless the strategies and indicators used are statistically/quantitatively *proven to be meaningful*. There are a lot of articles being published (and even shared here) about TLRY's TA - ignore them. They have zero weight on Tilray's future. Most of these chart patterns, strategies, theories, ideas, etc. taught in traditional trading education come from early 1900's anecdotal theories, which were nothing more than early, primitive attempts to identify patterns in markets. But, this is a story and an explanation for another time.

**In-Depth MACD Explanation:**

Since it's a popular retail indicator, most of you probably already know what the Moving Average Converence/Divergence (MACD) is. However, it's usually not well understood. The MACD takes in three settings for Moving Averages (MA) and the two lines plotted on the indicator are calculated as so:

MACD Line: Short MA - Long MA

Signal Line: Signal MA of the MACD Line

This is actually an incredibly clever way of measuring momentum and trend-following. By taking the difference between two different MA periods, we get a second-derivative (i.e. acceleration). By default, the MACD is calculated an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and with period settings (12, 26, 9).

**So, onto TLRY's** ***potential*** **momentum shift:**

*Note that I said ""potential,"" because the land of quantitative/algorithmic trading is nothing more than a probability game developed through hypothesis testing.*

Today, TLRY experienced a MACD crossover with MACD settings (SMA, 28, 48, 32). Why these settings? Because I ran a statistical backtest on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and simulated over 140,000 settings in an attempt to find the best practical combination to signal price change over the next few days via MACD crossover (Fun fact: using a Simple Moving Average (SMA) *always* yields better results, no matter what symbol or asset class).

If I were to buy ever MACD (SMA, 28, 48, 32) crossover at the daily closing price and hold for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days, what would my results be? Here's the results for the SPY since 2003:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k8lmq168hi071.png?width=1885&format=png&auto=webp&s=1af5f7ce7e179b59a18a198aaab1447e6177afc8

Positive mean returns and a high win frequency are significant, with the 1st day after buying being the most important. So, now that we've seen it's general significance in large-cap, what are the backtested results for TLRY? Well, it's tough because Tilray hasn't had a publicly traded stock for very long, so the sample size is insufficiently small. But, take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/6d1lvnx9hi071.png?width=1932&format=png&auto=webp&s=24595178d1e6e808074bd46a7e8ad6a8442b3e98

It still holds some significance with the positive means and win frequencies. But obviously with only 9 crossovers happening in TLRY's lifetime, we can't take these numbers and fit them to any model.

**So, using the most statistically effective MACD period settings, TLRY** ***may*** **be getting a shift in momentum here fairly soon!**

I understand that my initial claims for the (28, 48, 32) settings were only tested on the SPY, and Tilray isn't large-cap growth. There is still more testing and solidifying to do. BUT, I figured you apes who are still holding are continually waiting for a confirmation bias, so here you go :)",nhyj2a,Tilray (TLRY) MACD Momentum Shift - Quantitative TA

Edit: nice close at 19$

You probably havent heard about [The Lion Electric Company](https://thelionelectric.com/). Its because its only been 2 weeks since they are officially listed on both [NYSE](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy5d2/nyselev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [TSX](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy67g/tsxlev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). Before that, you could only buy the SPAC's stock Northern Genesis Acquisition. This is when I first bought most of my shares.

Basic infos about the stock:
- currently worth 19 U$D (+30% this week and its the highest ever with ticker LEV)
- Market Cap 3,5 billion USD


What does the Lion do? They do 100% electric trucks and busses.
And yes there is a lot of competition in the EV market, but not that much for trucks. Lion doesnt make cars, only trucks. They also already have orders from Amazon and scholar institution. 


What makes me think LEV is a buy



1. Lion is going to open a manufacturing facility in Illinois worth about $500M. The Illinois government is financing $70M for this. When full operational, the factory will be able to produce 20,000 vehicles per year. It will be the biggest of its kind in the US. Lion says they plan they start production in mid-2022. 



2. Lion is also opening a battery factory in Quebec (Canada). The government is financing 100M CAD (roughly 82M USD) to help them build it. This means that not only Lion will make 100% electric trucks, they will also produce their own batteries which they could potentially sell to other businesses in the future. But most important is that they wont have to buy it from another. 



3. Canada will no longer allow to sell new gasoline vehicles by 2035 (it doesnt concern used cars). This is in 15 years (only? Lol). But a lot of companies already started their transition to 100% EV. And all the state owned business will buy from a Canadian company, because thats how Canada works most of the time. All the school busses and normal busses have to be replaced, and we know they wont buy from a Chinese company when there is a Canadian one available. So its probably going to be Lion Electric. You should also note that some private companies like Loblaws are already transitioning to EV, they bought a lot of Tesla trucks recently. However, Lion's trucks are not only Canadian but also expected to be cheaper and good quality. 



4. Lion has clients
Amazon made a contract with Lion to buy 2,500 trucks over 5 years. But theres a downside: Lion is obliged to reserve 500 trucks per year for Amazon, while Amazon isnt obliged to actually buy them. It means that if the trucks quality is deceiptive, its possible Amazon would not buy them. This would of course be horrible for the stock.
But Amazon isnt the only big client: First Student bought 260 busses from Lion. It was announced this week, and I can still feel the +30% impact on my portfolio. Everyday LEV went higher than the previous one. 



5. LEV has a huge potential for long term profit. I personally think the stock could reach 25USD before the end of the year, but it could be even more. And when the Illinois facility will finally open, the stock should go higher than 30. If you look up the Northern Genesis stock history (the SPAC that merged with Lion 3 weeks ago), you will see the stock was at 30+ in January, but it fell with all the EV market. If you dont buy LEV this year, it might be too late. Of course the stock will be way higher in 5 years than now, but the more profit the better, right?



So in my opinion, you will make 100% to 300% within 3-4 years with this stock. But I am not an expert and you dont have to trust me. I trust myself and mostly trust The Lion Electric Company. I am already making small profit from this investment.


Have a good day and may your portfolio be green!",nhyn43,LEV: Lion Electric is the underdog

Now, there are two narratives if you are interested in buying SNDL stock. First is the bullish one that points to the ample cash on its balance sheet. As I noted in a previous article, SNDL is becoming like the Berkshire Hathaway of the marijuana industry. The company is investing and lending to several smaller marijuana companies. Also, it could expand into the U.S. adult-use market.


As for TLRY, it looks like a good marijuana company to buy from a business perspective. The company is a marijuana powerhouse with international operations and both medical and adult-use businesses. Also, count on the post-merger synergies and economies of scale to work for the new TLRY.



To sum it up, from a purely business perspective, you will bet on TLRY. However, if you are looking at betting on an investment vehicle that can capitalize on the troubles of some of the smaller marijuana companies, SNDL will fit the bill.",nhzt5b,"SNDL vs TLRY, comment your favorite"

# Investment Thesis I: Established Leader in the Marketplace

LendingTree’s competitive advantages in the marketplace differentiate them from other loan or insurance comparison-shopping marketplaces.

   * Even in cities with  refinancing savings like Detroit present median savings of $23,409

# Investment Thesis II: Insurance Growth

* The insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and the number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Refer to chart ‘Segment Revenue’
   * Insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Expected revenue growth of 30% + compared to 2Q2020
* Acquisitions of QuoteWizard in 4Q2018 and ValuePenguin in 1Q2019 allowed them to enhance their insurance products 
   * QuoteWizard – one of the largest insurance comparison marketplaces in the growing online insurance advertising market
      * This acquisition established LendingTree as a leading player in the online insurance advertising industry while also allowing them to diversify their financial services category
      * Significant portion of their revenue growth in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was driven by their insurance leads business from this acquisition 
   * ValuePenguin – personal finance website that offers consumers objective analysis on variety of financial topics from insurance to credit cards
      * This acquisition provided immense value to insurance carriers and agents through their high-quality content and SEO capability – allowing them further scale in the insurance space
* New Medicare category for insurance growth showed significant promise during their first open-enrollment period in the 4Q2020
   * Presents a significant opportunity for their insurance segment 

# Major Risks 

**Consumer Demand Risk –** a general increase in interest rates may affect the ability of LendingTree’s mortgage Network Partners to close loans which will translate to lower revenues for LendingTree and ultimately affect their financial position

**Interest Rate Risk –** The Federal Reserve is currently printing out more money in order to keep the markets afloat due to COVID-19. In the long-term, this will cause inflation and the decreasing value of the USD. To combat this, the Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates

# Final Thoughts

The positive industry outlook and the prospective insurance segment of LendingTree that has generated high growth YoY strengthen analysts’ recommendations to BUY. Given a stock price forecast projecting a median price target of $320 (60.7% upside) and a low-price target of $200 (0.5% upside), I believe this stock still has a low of room for growth as they continue to diversify its revenue streams and expanding their financial services. Furthermore, I’ve provided a chart of analyst recommendations retrieved from CNN Business that strengthens the recommendation to BUY.

For full disclosure I own several calls at the $20, $22, $23  expiring in June-Sept as well as shares of GOLD for the long to medium term. I'm no financial advisor and I'm likely wrong.

The stock has been seeing some resistance at $25 lately, but if the price of gold per ounce ($1881 currently) crosses the $1890... June is going to be a very good month for Barrick Gold. It's a quality company in my opinion & the market is at a tipping point, so it's a good safety net (maybe...)

$29 by end of summer? Would love to hear your thoughts

# W-Shape Note:

* We needed to close above 418 for the w-shape to be confirmed. This didn't happen :(
* Maybe next week?

# BULLS v BEARS - Who's in control?

* Essentially been consolidating since 5/11 (even longer if you zoom out - about 4/6 ish range)
* Short term - we've made higher low but not a higher high. We've made a lower high.
* This highlights uncertainty IMO. (iNfLaTiOn AnYoNe?)
* **410 break is still the line in the sand IMO.**
* **415 and above and market favors bulls IMO.**
* **410 and below and marker favors bears IMO.**

# 1D Timeframe

* We've hit heavy resistance at the gap fill - two full days with resistance @ gap fill.
* **IMO. We see 420+ or 405- next week. A higher-high or a lower-low! But let's see!**

1665,,2021-05-21 22:53:12,t3_ni535o,,wallstreetbets,"Shorting Pre Market Top Gainers sometimes works. If you're smart about it you can make an easy 7% daily return and if you're an idiot you might make 1%. The main dependency of whether it goes up or down depends on its Catalyst. Here's 1 week data on shorting Top Gainers. Read the whole post for the spreadsheet terminology to make full sense.

1 Week Spreadsheet of Shorting Top gainers:

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15H4gJJNRtfMae-umZnkWcDevsSE0ze9C91qFkDfX5zU/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15H4gJJNRtfMae-umZnkWcDevsSE0ze9C91qFkDfX5zU/edit?usp=sharing)

Resources Used:

Finviz Elite

Omni Average Calculator

Calculator Soup Percentage Change

**Important Info:**

Quality of Catalyst was purely subjective and decided upon before market open

All percentages assume equal amount of Shorts

For Tuesday N/A I counted it as the 10.32% in the column to its left in tabulation 5 day Average

All Stocks were top gainers at around 9:10-9:20

Green is returns, meaning the stock price fell

Red is Loss, which means stock price went up

**Profit% Av**\- Average Daily Return

**Profit%<Av**\- Average Daily Return for Stocks with Average volume than Volume

**Profit% Av** **~~YY~~**\- Average daily profit for stocks with no Amazing News

**Profit% < Av** **~~YY~~**\- Average Daily Return for Stocks with Volume less than Average Volume and no Amazing News

**Profit %Av YB/N**\- Average Daily Return for stock with Bad or No news

**Profit %<Av YB/N**\- Average Daily Return for Stocks with Volume less than Average Volume and No, or Bad news

**YB**\- Catalyst Bad for Stock

**YY**\- Catalyst Good For Stock

**Max**\- Average Individual Open to Low

**Final Thoughts:**

Successful Clinical trials affect stock price more for treatment for Alzheimer and Cancer,  and less for conditions like Narcolepsy

V/Av V only matters if its very High

Even if you are the master of high speed trading, you won't get the max profit %

I haven't tried this on a non-paper account so I'm gonna try this with $1000 next week, so wish me luck

I have found 2 or 3 more shortable trends with higher daily returns and I will continue keeping tracking data for the next month, but my online High School workload is crazy so no guarantees

If you get rich off this strategy, at least name your Yacht after me

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

TLDR; BIGC good, like SHOP, but undervalued.

Inflation is gonna destroy non-asset holders. I’m a bit worried about discount retail (5 below, DG, Dollar Tree) holding up because the business models are predicated on selling commodities at a certain price point. If commodity prices skyrocket dollar tree especially is gonna have a tough time adjusting since literally everything in their store is a dollar. So I think the better bet is to buy the actual companies that create goods that the poor are capable of buying (since inflation will eradicate much of the middle class.) Vizio products would never be sold in one of these stores but they sell really cheap TVs with internet accessibility. They sell a really good product considering the price point. I check their books and it’s a profitable company that’s been improving margins that last two years. Pretty low market cap so I wouldn’t be shocked if a larger company sought to buy it in the future.

1875,,2021-05-21 07:40:32,t3_nhmv7n,,wallstreetbets,"Ford is great value investment considering it will compete with TESLA for EV market - Most of bear case is ford debt and they are 100% wrong. Please read below article.

**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    
**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford’s finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford’s automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford’s $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford’s $160 billion debt load.

From old post:

1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

1877,,2021-05-21 09:36:45,t3_nhoi3w,,wallstreetbets,"Virgin Galactic announced they have a test flight scheduled for tomorrow and the stock moved up by 14% yesterday. I’m overall bearish on this company, as founder Richard Branson and SPAC-backer Chamath Palihapitiya have both sold basically all of their shares. Cathie Woods doesn’t even own it for ARK. 

I want to buy puts in anticipation of a drop Monday, this seems like the most likely outcome to me. Whether the launch is a failure or people just sell the news after a big move, it seems unlikely that it continues to rally Monday. There’s a lot of bag holders who bought at $40-60 a couple months ago that would love to get out if it bounces which would theoretically limit its possible gains Monday. On the chance the test flight greatly exceeds expectations or there is another announcement included along side the test, the stock could fly however. I feel that this is a slim but non-zero possibility. Basically whichever way it moves, it’s going to move hard. June 4th options have an IV of 165% per thinkorswim. 

My question is whether I am better off buying straight puts on $SPCE or if I should buy some sort of call/put spread to hedge my downside in the event the stock continues to fly Monday. My main concern is making the right move and still getting IV crushed. I’m looking at 6/4/21 $20 puts, or a spread at the same strike and expiry. In your opinions, is that a smart move or is there something else I should be considering? I’m still relatively new to trading options. 

Thanks for your input!

I suspect Nokia will have a favorable win rate as others try to compete with ReefShark. Nokia’s AI-enabled chip ReefShark which is used to power Nokia’s 5G base stations made up 44% of 5G sales. ReefShark is on track to reach 70% of 5G sales by year’s end. ReefShark is Nokia’s most recent semiconductor that powers its 5G base stations.

The ReefShark chipset is smaller, decreasing the antenna size by half, which makes these base stations less bulky and obtrusive.

1881,,2021-05-21 11:44:07,t3_nhqhhk,,wallstreetbets,"Explosive fires have started everywhere already. Stock markets are on fire and so are property markets, as well as bond and debt markets. The problem is that fires are initially explosive but always end up implosive. 

How predictable events are (and people). This is particularly true in the world economy. Empires come and go, economies boom and bust and new currencies come and without fail always go. All this happens with regularity. 

&#x200B;

 Everything really on fire :

 We have seen  about inflation running wild and it is not just happening in stocks. Property markets are literarily exploding, especially the high end. We see this all over the world and not just in the US. In the UK for example, HSBC stated that March saw the highest number of mortgages EVER issued. In Sweden properties sell for up to 40% above asking price in a frenzied bidding war and second hand leisure boats are in such demand that they cost virtually the same as a new boat. And if you want a new boat, there is none available until 2022. It also seems that people are desperate for company after the lockdowns as prices for puppies in the UK are up to 100% higher than last year.

 Yes, everything is really on fire as people are desperate to just spend, spend, spend after a year of lockdowns and restrictions. 

 AN ECONOMIC BUBBLE OF AIR

 Since air is free, governments can produce unlimited amounts of it. And without exception, gullible people want to believe that it is actually real money and not just empty air. The beauty for the government is that they can just produce and borrow trillions of dollars at ZERO cost. And by manipulating interest rates they can borrow this money also at virtually ZERO cost. 

 So first the government manufactures the money at no cost and then they pay NOTHING for the privilege of borrowing that money. 

 The money obviously creates massive bubbles in stocks, bonds, houses, used cars , boats, puppies and other massively overvalued investments and consumer items. 

 Just look at how, for example, the Dow has gone up **exponentially and parabolically** **in the last year in an historically unprecedented straight line.** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lnjdj8xvlg071.png?width=461&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a5b514632f262f311d158e14416251b98f6d00e

 

**US Federal Debt up 74X**  
**Total US debt up “only” 49X**  
**M2 Money Supply up 29X>**

**Debt to GDP 1971: 37% – 2021: 127%**

 Bubbles are called bubbles because they consist of air. And when bubbles become too big, they ALWAYS and without fail burst and implode. 

 Technically markets are giving very clear signals that THE END IS NIGH.

Whether that means days weeks or a few months, is totally irrelevant. We know that we are at the end of the most remarkable period in history in regards to money, investments and the economy.

 GOLD, SILVER AND WEALTH PRESERVATION

Gold  and Silver  have not at all reflected the massive creation of money in the last 50 years. That catchup phase is likely to start very soon based on both fundamentals and technicals. 

As regards securing your finances in periods of crisis, gold and silver have always been critical to hold.

 Everyone can afford some gold or silver. An ounce of silver is $28 and one gramme of gold is $50. So saving in precious metals will not only be very useful but essential at whatever level you can afford.

 The upside potential for gold and silver is multiples of the current prices and that is at today’s price levels. Higher inflation could take the metals to unfathomable heights.

Looking ahead, with the Olympics, the soccer world cup qualifiers, the main leagues restarting everywhere, I expect massive growth in paid subscribers.

Now, onto the revenue side. The ARPU is approximately constant at around 69$/month since Q3 2020. The low seasonality of Q1 means that the relative share of ARPU due to the advertising is quite low compared to Q3 and Q4 last year. Which means that a great improvement of the subscription ARPU has been reached in Q1!

Now, when we'll go into Q3 and then Q4, with the absurd growth in number of subscribers and the massive gains from advertising, I'm expecting the ARPU to again grow. Expected advertising growth is 100% YOY.

And what happens when you combine massive subscribers and ARPU growth? You have massive results.

The cherries on the cake are:

1. Fubo betting which comes as a free version in Q3 and then paid version in Q4. It can be massive as Fubo will be the only player in the industry to control end to end the viewer/bettor experience.
2. International expansion, in Europe first probably, starting in 2022.
3. Accepting wagering in unconventional currencies.

The potential is so large it's not a cherry anymore, but rather a pineapple on the cake 🍍🎂

# TA Notes

* Resistance still at 416-418 gap fill on the 1d timeframe
* Support at 415-414
* 20 SMMA support. I believe we need to test the 20 SMMA so this will be dip buying opportunity if bullish.
* Expecting small moves today. Play tight and ITM 0dte if you're a degen.
* Bulls need to break 418 and test support. I think we top out at around 420 if 418 support holds.
* Bears need to break 414. I don't think we go below 410 tho but we shall see.
* Bullish 🎯 - 419 - 420 - 420.53 - 422.29
* Bearish 🎯 - 412 - 410 - 409.08 - 408.07 - 407.12

I know, in the last week many talked about a possible future crash in the stock market, inflation and there is too much liquidity and bla bla bla. I am not here to say the next crash will occur this October or on any other date (I well know that correlation is not causation). I have no subtle purpose to share, it's just for the curiosity of this pattern.

p.s. Probably the cause is because October is my birthday.

I don't know if there is something to discuss this, but I would appreciate your opinions.

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes – well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you’ll double your money. This isn’t some wishy washy bullshit oh it’s going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it’s just a question of when. How can I be so sure? They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.

Should you trust me? Am I financial advisor – good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips. Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago? We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can’t lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist? What the fuck does that mean – fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill. Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn’t just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine – kind of a big deal. They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year. Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe – think FDA is going to delay?

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no. They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted. Added bonus – Pfizer’s big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also – or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain’t going cheap. They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner. Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn’t allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth. The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes – former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – not piece of shit pharma we have here. Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks. You don’t have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear. No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential? Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities – hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men’s lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself. Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant’s drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued. MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down - whatever could they do with that cash? $44 a share wouldn’t even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down. With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in – remember this isn’t some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them. And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can’t see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone. FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they’ve already approved in new indications like this one. Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point. It’s down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason. FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density – the solution: they will monitor bone density. That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on – doesn’t that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer. Even if they don’t Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs. Truly can’t fucking lose. so why is it trading so cheap? Well cause no one knows about it, and the upside is only written down in Japanese.",nhssad,Guaranteed Buyout and Doubling of Funds if grab Myovant (MYOV)

**Legitimate company and not a meme?** Yes. 

20 year old company with a solid balance sheet, solid earnings, profitable every quarter, and beat EPS consistently all of last year. Every damn quarter they provided positive guidance, yet the wallstreet cucks would still under-cut their expectations, only for CSIQ to crush earnings.

They make fucking solar panels, and have been doing it for 20 years! Tesla solar roofs are meme products. When my employer wanted to add solar panels for our 3 factories, we didn't call up Tesla. We called up a EPC firm who chose Canadian Solar as the supplier.

It was Congressionally mandated in the last stimulus bill and gave the government 180 days to release an unclassified report to the general public and a classified report to congress. We are approaching that time, and June/July could be a heavy shift in perspectives and R&D priorities. [Sen. Rubio's Comments](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ufo-reports-should-be-taken-seriously-rubio-says-11621245038) [WaPo Article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/03/23/ufo-report-covid-bill/)

These UAP’s exhibit unexplainable flight characteristics: near instantaneous acceleration, airplane/submersible hybrid characteristics, visual disappearance, odd acoustics, etc. Also, multiple “types” of craft have been observed. 

There are patents filed by the Navy for inertial mass reduction craft (basically creating a quantum vacuum around the craft to avoid air/water resistance; useful to go Mach 16+ in the atmosphere). Here’s the patent: [Triangular UAP Patent?](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10144532B2/en). Additionally, we have heard rumors (and they may just be rumors) of anti-gravity temporal displacement craft. These craft can accelerate by utilizing gravity waves, bend light through a gravity well (stealthy), and externally perceived time could be affected as well (think Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar) ([Gravity Wave Patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10322827B2/) ) This UAP sightings might be manned craft or something else, or a mixture of both. These patents could also be counter-espionage missions to throw foreign countries off true technological breakthroughs, but we do know there was a demo of the tech: [Navy acknowledging demo, but not production ready](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/37134/emails-show-navys-ufo-patents-went-through-significant-internal-review-resulted-in-a-demo)

Okay great, so what’s the play…

**Long-Raytheon ($RTX)** has the Advanced Targeting Forward Look Infrared Sensor, which can be utilized to track UAP’s. This technology has been out for over a decade. Additionally, Raytheon is the go-to company for research into lasers, targeted radiation, or proton beams (still no word on proton torpedoes). ([UFO Targeting Pod](https://sofrep.com/news/following-pentagon-admission-raytheon-touts-gear-ufo-spotter/))

**Long-Lockheed Martin ($LMT)** a major defense aerospace firm, which developed many prototypes over the years and is famous for the Skunkworks R&D lab. Former Senator Harry Reid believes Lockheed has UAP fragments in their possession ([UAP Fragments](https://deadline.com/2021/04/ufo-fragments-in-possession-lockheed-martin-says-harry-reid-1234748095/)). These fragments are believed to be made of an unknown metal/alloy, and potentially 3D printed at an atomic level.

**Long-Northrup Grumman ($NOC)** is a defense giant which developed the B-2 stealth bomber and is a contractor on multiple space infrastructure missions. They would be vital for advanced composites/metallurgy, advanced avionics, spaceflight, and tracking systems.

Additionally, we have no clear knowledge of where the Chinese and Russians are at with this technology. Maybe this is partly why we founded Space Force? This is a \~2 month play to see if we can get more decisive acknowledgement of the technology whether it is manned or alien, either way it could make for an interesting news summer.",nht2ep,The Alien Trade

Can't believe I'm gonna throw shade on a firm I used to love but they have REALLY gone down hill.  Don't feel like writing a wall of text but want to warn others who are thinking of switching into them so I'm just going to bullet point problems I've had.  If you are with them already and feel so-so about them... there are better options out there.  Moving money is a pain in the ass but it might be worth it.

**Issues I've had with them**

* Margin approval is like pulling teeth.  They want to grill you to death for like half an hour and slowly increase your options approval one step at a time (honestly some of those guys seem like idiots and I'm not sure how they got their certifications).  If they don't like exactly how you answer questions even as an experienced trader that's been doing it for a while, they will delay your application by up to 6 months before you can try again.  That hasn't happened to me fortunately but apparently they do that so I'm always very anxious talking to them.  I have $600k ish with them in all my accounts and my risk per trade is typically capped at $50-60k.  I tend to have extra cash if I need to average down or add something to hedge my position.  Never used margin even though I have it since it's required to do a lot of different trades.

* Frequent outages (especially at market open), error messages, slow to load in the browser portal.  Desktop platform ""StreetSmart"" is terrible IMO but I suppose that is a matter of taste.  They're portal option trading is otherwise aright, I've seen better and worse but nothing to write home about.

* $1k recently mysteriously disappeared in my account.  They were quick to correct it and apparently it's some ""very rare"" programming error but who the fuck knows for sure.  I'm sure a lot of retards out there don't even notice if money is ever missing.

* Finally, something that has always bothered me is that their execution doesn't seem that good.  With options especially +/- a couple pennies (or nickel for larger contracts) can actually make a huge difference on your P&L for a trade.  They are THE LEADER in PFOF revenue.  Fuck them.


When I joined them close to 20 years ago, I worshiped Charles Schwab.  You can google him but he was Good Guy broker when no one cared about retail back in the day.

The way I see it is there is no way that the price of SPCE will stay the same from today going into Monday. 

One of three options are going to play out.

1. Successful test flight
2. Test flight delayed, again 
3. Unsuccessful test flight

Regardless of the situation, the needle is going to move a LOT. How are you playing this rocket ride? 

I have a few 17p and 16p expiring Monday and a few HUGELY OTM calls expiring next Friday. I’m more expecting a total failure, but on the off chance it’s a huge success those calls are going to print.

What are y’all’s positions?

And to all the people saying you wouldn’t touch SPCE with a 40 foot pole, why? The stock is going to move one way or another and if you’re really that against it, buy puts and put your Twitter fingers to work.

1910,,2021-05-21 17:50:01,t3_nhyj2a,,wallstreetbets," **Before I talk Technical Analysis (TA), it is important to understand the following:**

Technical Analysis is absolute meaningless astrology unless the strategies and indicators used are statistically/quantitatively *proven to be meaningful*. There are a lot of articles being published (and even shared here) about TLRY's TA - ignore them. They have zero weight on Tilray's future. Most of these chart patterns, strategies, theories, ideas, etc. taught in traditional trading education come from early 1900's anecdotal theories, which were nothing more than early, primitive attempts to identify patterns in markets. But, this is a story and an explanation for another time.

**In-Depth MACD Explanation:**

Since it's a popular retail indicator, most of you probably already know what the Moving Average Converence/Divergence (MACD) is. However, it's usually not well understood. The MACD takes in three settings for Moving Averages (MA) and the two lines plotted on the indicator are calculated as so:

MACD Line: Short MA - Long MA

Signal Line: Signal MA of the MACD Line

This is actually an incredibly clever way of measuring momentum and trend-following. By taking the difference between two different MA periods, we get a second-derivative (i.e. acceleration). By default, the MACD is calculated an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and with period settings (12, 26, 9).

**So, onto TLRY's** ***potential*** **momentum shift:**

*Note that I said ""potential,"" because the land of quantitative/algorithmic trading is nothing more than a probability game developed through hypothesis testing.*

Today, TLRY experienced a MACD crossover with MACD settings (SMA, 28, 48, 32). Why these settings? Because I ran a statistical backtest on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and simulated over 140,000 settings in an attempt to find the best practical combination to signal price change over the next few days via MACD crossover (Fun fact: using a Simple Moving Average (SMA) *always* yields better results, no matter what symbol or asset class).

If I were to buy ever MACD (SMA, 28, 48, 32) crossover at the daily closing price and hold for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days, what would my results be? Here's the results for the SPY since 2003:

Positive mean returns and a high win frequency are significant, with the 1st day after buying being the most important. So, now that we've seen it's general significance in large-cap, what are the backtested results for TLRY? Well, it's tough because Tilray hasn't had a publicly traded stock for very long, so the sample size is insufficiently small. But, take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/6d1lvnx9hi071.png?width=1932&format=png&auto=webp&s=24595178d1e6e808074bd46a7e8ad6a8442b3e98

It still holds some significance with the positive means and win frequencies. But obviously with only 9 crossovers happening in TLRY's lifetime, we can't take these numbers and fit them to any model.

**So, using the most statistically effective MACD period settings, TLRY** ***may*** **be getting a shift in momentum here fairly soon!**

I understand that my initial claims for the (28, 48, 32) settings were only tested on the SPY, and Tilray isn't large-cap growth. There is still more testing and solidifying to do. BUT, I figured you apes who are still holding are continually waiting for a confirmation bias, so here you go :)",nhyj2a,Tilray (TLRY) MACD Momentum Shift - Quantitative TA

Edit: nice close at 19$

You probably havent heard about [The Lion Electric Company](https://thelionelectric.com/). Its because its only been 2 weeks since they are officially listed on both [NYSE](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy5d2/nyselev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [TSX](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy67g/tsxlev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). Before that, you could only buy the SPAC's stock Northern Genesis Acquisition. This is when I first bought most of my shares.

Basic infos about the stock:
- currently worth 19 U$D (+30% this week and its the highest ever with ticker LEV)
- Market Cap 3,5 billion USD


What does the Lion do? They do 100% electric trucks and busses.
And yes there is a lot of competition in the EV market, but not that much for trucks. Lion doesnt make cars, only trucks. They also already have orders from Amazon and scholar institution. 


What makes me think LEV is a buy



1. Lion is going to open a manufacturing facility in Illinois worth about $500M. The Illinois government is financing $70M for this. When full operational, the factory will be able to produce 20,000 vehicles per year. It will be the biggest of its kind in the US. Lion says they plan they start production in mid-2022. 



2. Lion is also opening a battery factory in Quebec (Canada). The government is financing 100M CAD (roughly 82M USD) to help them build it. This means that not only Lion will make 100% electric trucks, they will also produce their own batteries which they could potentially sell to other businesses in the future. But most important is that they wont have to buy it from another. 



3. Canada will no longer allow to sell new gasoline vehicles by 2035 (it doesnt concern used cars). This is in 15 years (only? Lol). But a lot of companies already started their transition to 100% EV. And all the state owned business will buy from a Canadian company, because thats how Canada works most of the time. All the school busses and normal busses have to be replaced, and we know they wont buy from a Chinese company when there is a Canadian one available. So its probably going to be Lion Electric. You should also note that some private companies like Loblaws are already transitioning to EV, they bought a lot of Tesla trucks recently. However, Lion's trucks are not only Canadian but also expected to be cheaper and good quality. 



4. Lion has clients
Amazon made a contract with Lion to buy 2,500 trucks over 5 years. But theres a downside: Lion is obliged to reserve 500 trucks per year for Amazon, while Amazon isnt obliged to actually buy them. It means that if the trucks quality is deceiptive, its possible Amazon would not buy them. This would of course be horrible for the stock.
But Amazon isnt the only big client: First Student bought 260 busses from Lion. It was announced this week, and I can still feel the +30% impact on my portfolio. Everyday LEV went higher than the previous one. 



5. LEV has a huge potential for long term profit. I personally think the stock could reach 25USD before the end of the year, but it could be even more. And when the Illinois facility will finally open, the stock should go higher than 30. If you look up the Northern Genesis stock history (the SPAC that merged with Lion 3 weeks ago), you will see the stock was at 30+ in January, but it fell with all the EV market. If you dont buy LEV this year, it might be too late. Of course the stock will be way higher in 5 years than now, but the more profit the better, right?



So in my opinion, you will make 100% to 300% within 3-4 years with this stock. But I am not an expert and you dont have to trust me. I trust myself and mostly trust The Lion Electric Company. I am already making small profit from this investment.


Have a good day and may your portfolio be green!",nhyn43,LEV: Lion Electric is the underdog

Now, there are two narratives if you are interested in buying SNDL stock. First is the bullish one that points to the ample cash on its balance sheet. As I noted in a previous article, SNDL is becoming like the Berkshire Hathaway of the marijuana industry. The company is investing and lending to several smaller marijuana companies. Also, it could expand into the U.S. adult-use market.


As for TLRY, it looks like a good marijuana company to buy from a business perspective. The company is a marijuana powerhouse with international operations and both medical and adult-use businesses. Also, count on the post-merger synergies and economies of scale to work for the new TLRY.



To sum it up, from a purely business perspective, you will bet on TLRY. However, if you are looking at betting on an investment vehicle that can capitalize on the troubles of some of the smaller marijuana companies, SNDL will fit the bill.",nhzt5b,"SNDL vs TLRY, comment your favorite"

* Pandemic-driven demand sent total home sales to the highest since 2006

# Investment Thesis I: Established Leader in the Marketplace

LendingTree’s competitive advantages in the marketplace differentiate them from other loan or insurance comparison-shopping marketplaces.

* **Speed:** easy-use; apply for loans in minutes and lock-in rates
* **Convenience:** search and apply for quotes 24/7 from anywhere in the world
* **Competitive Rates:** average buyer saves $125-$163 per month for interest
   * LendingTree has saved refinanced borrowers the most in San Francisco, San Diego and Los Angeles with median savings of $80,211, $77,740 and $73,954 respectively
   * Even in cities with  refinancing savings like Detroit present median savings of $23,409

# Investment Thesis II: Insurance Growth

* The insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and the number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Refer to chart ‘Segment Revenue’
   * Insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Expected revenue growth of 30% + compared to 2Q2020
* Acquisitions of QuoteWizard in 4Q2018 and ValuePenguin in 1Q2019 allowed them to enhance their insurance products 
   * QuoteWizard – one of the largest insurance comparison marketplaces in the growing online insurance advertising market
      * This acquisition established LendingTree as a leading player in the online insurance advertising industry while also allowing them to diversify their financial services category
      * Significant portion of their revenue growth in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was driven by their insurance leads business from this acquisition 
   * ValuePenguin – personal finance website that offers consumers objective analysis on variety of financial topics from insurance to credit cards
      * This acquisition provided immense value to insurance carriers and agents through their high-quality content and SEO capability – allowing them further scale in the insurance space
* New Medicare category for insurance growth showed significant promise during their first open-enrollment period in the 4Q2020
   * Presents a significant opportunity for their insurance segment 

# Major Risks 

**Consumer Demand Risk –** a general increase in interest rates may affect the ability of LendingTree’s mortgage Network Partners to close loans which will translate to lower revenues for LendingTree and ultimately affect their financial position

**Interest Rate Risk –** The Federal Reserve is currently printing out more money in order to keep the markets afloat due to COVID-19. In the long-term, this will cause inflation and the decreasing value of the USD. To combat this, the Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates

# Final Thoughts

The positive industry outlook and the prospective insurance segment of LendingTree that has generated high growth YoY strengthen analysts’ recommendations to BUY. Given a stock price forecast projecting a median price target of $320 (60.7% upside) and a low-price target of $200 (0.5% upside), I believe this stock still has a low of room for growth as they continue to diversify its revenue streams and expanding their financial services. Furthermore, I’ve provided a chart of analyst recommendations retrieved from CNN Business that strengthens the recommendation to BUY.

GOLD is a good value company, with over 12B in revenue in 2020 & market cap is only 3.5x last year's revenue. Over 2B/yr in earnings the last 2 years & 5B in cash. Most of the business is in Gold mining 20% is in copper. Commodity prices keep climbing higher, so it's a good hedge for inflation.

For full disclosure I own several calls at the $20, $22, $23  expiring in June-Sept as well as shares of GOLD for the long to medium term. I'm no financial advisor and I'm likely wrong.

The stock has been seeing some resistance at $25 lately, but if the price of gold per ounce ($1881 currently) crosses the $1890... June is going to be a very good month for Barrick Gold. It's a quality company in my opinion & the market is at a tipping point, so it's a good safety net (maybe...)

* This highlights uncertainty IMO. (iNfLaTiOn AnYoNe?)
* **410 break is still the line in the sand IMO.**
* **415 and above and market favors bulls IMO.**
* **410 and below and marker favors bears IMO.**

# 1D Timeframe

* We've hit heavy resistance at the gap fill - two full days with resistance @ gap fill.
* **IMO. We see 420+ or 405- next week. A higher-high or a lower-low! But let's see!**

1940,,2021-05-21 22:53:12,t3_ni535o,,wallstreetbets,"Shorting Pre Market Top Gainers sometimes works. If you're smart about it you can make an easy 7% daily return and if you're an idiot you might make 1%. The main dependency of whether it goes up or down depends on its Catalyst. Here's 1 week data on shorting Top Gainers. Read the whole post for the spreadsheet terminology to make full sense.

1 Week Spreadsheet of Shorting Top gainers:

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15H4gJJNRtfMae-umZnkWcDevsSE0ze9C91qFkDfX5zU/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15H4gJJNRtfMae-umZnkWcDevsSE0ze9C91qFkDfX5zU/edit?usp=sharing)

Resources Used:

Finviz Elite

Omni Average Calculator

Calculator Soup Percentage Change

**Important Info:**

Quality of Catalyst was purely subjective and decided upon before market open

All percentages assume equal amount of Shorts

For Tuesday N/A I counted it as the 10.32% in the column to its left in tabulation 5 day Average

All Stocks were top gainers at around 9:10-9:20

Green is returns, meaning the stock price fell

Red is Loss, which means stock price went up

**Profit% Av**\- Average Daily Return

**Profit%<Av**\- Average Daily Return for Stocks with Average volume than Volume

**Profit% Av** **~~YY~~**\- Average daily profit for stocks with no Amazing News

**Profit% < Av** **~~YY~~**\- Average Daily Return for Stocks with Volume less than Average Volume and no Amazing News

**Profit %Av YB/N**\- Average Daily Return for stock with Bad or No news

**Profit %<Av YB/N**\- Average Daily Return for Stocks with Volume less than Average Volume and No, or Bad news

**YB**\- Catalyst Bad for Stock

**YY**\- Catalyst Good For Stock

**Max**\- Average Individual Open to Low

**Final Thoughts:**

Successful Clinical trials affect stock price more for treatment for Alzheimer and Cancer,  and less for conditions like Narcolepsy

V/Av V only matters if its very High

Even if you are the master of high speed trading, you won't get the max profit %

I haven't tried this on a non-paper account so I'm gonna try this with $1000 next week, so wish me luck

I have found 2 or 3 more shortable trends with higher daily returns and I will continue keeping tracking data for the next month, but my online High School workload is crazy so no guarantees

If you get rich off this strategy, at least name your Yacht after me

From Youtube: ""YouTube’s right to monetize: YouTube has the right to monetize all content on the platform and ads may appear on videos from channels not in the YouTube Partner Program.""

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

Inflation is gonna destroy non-asset holders. I’m a bit worried about discount retail (5 below, DG, Dollar Tree) holding up because the business models are predicated on selling commodities at a certain price point. If commodity prices skyrocket dollar tree especially is gonna have a tough time adjusting since literally everything in their store is a dollar. So I think the better bet is to buy the actual companies that create goods that the poor are capable of buying (since inflation will eradicate much of the middle class.) Vizio products would never be sold in one of these stores but they sell really cheap TVs with internet accessibility. They sell a really good product considering the price point. I check their books and it’s a profitable company that’s been improving margins that last two years. Pretty low market cap so I wouldn’t be shocked if a larger company sought to buy it in the future.

2150,,2021-05-21 07:40:32,t3_nhmv7n,,wallstreetbets,"Ford is great value investment considering it will compete with TESLA for EV market - Most of bear case is ford debt and they are 100% wrong. Please read below article.

**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    
**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford’s finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford’s automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford’s $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford’s $160 billion debt load.

From old post:

1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

2152,,2021-05-21 09:36:45,t3_nhoi3w,,wallstreetbets,"Virgin Galactic announced they have a test flight scheduled for tomorrow and the stock moved up by 14% yesterday. I’m overall bearish on this company, as founder Richard Branson and SPAC-backer Chamath Palihapitiya have both sold basically all of their shares. Cathie Woods doesn’t even own it for ARK. 

I want to buy puts in anticipation of a drop Monday, this seems like the most likely outcome to me. Whether the launch is a failure or people just sell the news after a big move, it seems unlikely that it continues to rally Monday. There’s a lot of bag holders who bought at $40-60 a couple months ago that would love to get out if it bounces which would theoretically limit its possible gains Monday. On the chance the test flight greatly exceeds expectations or there is another announcement included along side the test, the stock could fly however. I feel that this is a slim but non-zero possibility. Basically whichever way it moves, it’s going to move hard. June 4th options have an IV of 165% per thinkorswim. 

My question is whether I am better off buying straight puts on $SPCE or if I should buy some sort of call/put spread to hedge my downside in the event the stock continues to fly Monday. My main concern is making the right move and still getting IV crushed. I’m looking at 6/4/21 $20 puts, or a spread at the same strike and expiry. In your opinions, is that a smart move or is there something else I should be considering? I’m still relatively new to trading options. 

Thanks for your input!

I suspect Nokia will have a favorable win rate as others try to compete with ReefShark. Nokia’s AI-enabled chip ReefShark which is used to power Nokia’s 5G base stations made up 44% of 5G sales. ReefShark is on track to reach 70% of 5G sales by year’s end. ReefShark is Nokia’s most recent semiconductor that powers its 5G base stations.

The ReefShark chipset is smaller, decreasing the antenna size by half, which makes these base stations less bulky and obtrusive.

2156,,2021-05-21 11:44:07,t3_nhqhhk,,wallstreetbets,"Explosive fires have started everywhere already. Stock markets are on fire and so are property markets, as well as bond and debt markets. The problem is that fires are initially explosive but always end up implosive. 

How predictable events are (and people). This is particularly true in the world economy. Empires come and go, economies boom and bust and new currencies come and without fail always go. All this happens with regularity. 

&#x200B;

 Everything really on fire :

 We have seen  about inflation running wild and it is not just happening in stocks. Property markets are literarily exploding, especially the high end. We see this all over the world and not just in the US. In the UK for example, HSBC stated that March saw the highest number of mortgages EVER issued. In Sweden properties sell for up to 40% above asking price in a frenzied bidding war and second hand leisure boats are in such demand that they cost virtually the same as a new boat. And if you want a new boat, there is none available until 2022. It also seems that people are desperate for company after the lockdowns as prices for puppies in the UK are up to 100% higher than last year.

 Yes, everything is really on fire as people are desperate to just spend, spend, spend after a year of lockdowns and restrictions. 

 AN ECONOMIC BUBBLE OF AIR

 Since air is free, governments can produce unlimited amounts of it. And without exception, gullible people want to believe that it is actually real money and not just empty air. The beauty for the government is that they can just produce and borrow trillions of dollars at ZERO cost. And by manipulating interest rates they can borrow this money also at virtually ZERO cost. 

 So first the government manufactures the money at no cost and then they pay NOTHING for the privilege of borrowing that money. 

 The money obviously creates massive bubbles in stocks, bonds, houses, used cars , boats, puppies and other massively overvalued investments and consumer items. 

 Just look at how, for example, the Dow has gone up **exponentially and parabolically** **in the last year in an historically unprecedented straight line.** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lnjdj8xvlg071.png?width=461&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a5b514632f262f311d158e14416251b98f6d00e

 

**US Federal Debt up 74X**  
**Total US debt up “only” 49X**  
**M2 Money Supply up 29X>**

**Debt to GDP 1971: 37% – 2021: 127%**

 Bubbles are called bubbles because they consist of air. And when bubbles become too big, they ALWAYS and without fail burst and implode. 

 Technically markets are giving very clear signals that THE END IS NIGH.

Whether that means days weeks or a few months, is totally irrelevant. We know that we are at the end of the most remarkable period in history in regards to money, investments and the economy.

 GOLD, SILVER AND WEALTH PRESERVATION

Gold  and Silver  have not at all reflected the massive creation of money in the last 50 years. That catchup phase is likely to start very soon based on both fundamentals and technicals. 

As regards securing your finances in periods of crisis, gold and silver have always been critical to hold.

 Everyone can afford some gold or silver. An ounce of silver is $28 and one gramme of gold is $50. So saving in precious metals will not only be very useful but essential at whatever level you can afford.

 The upside potential for gold and silver is multiples of the current prices and that is at today’s price levels. Higher inflation could take the metals to unfathomable heights.

2158,,2021-05-21 12:45:14,t3_nhrmu8,,wallstreetbets,"FuboTV posted its Q1 results on the 11th. Seasonality in sports is obviously huge, with Q1 and Q2 being the worst periods of the season.

Consequently, there was always a sequential decline in the number of subscribers in Q1 and Q2 in 2019 and 2020. Typically between -8 and -9% sequentially. Given the amazing performance that was achieved in Q3 and Q4 last year, it was heavily expected that this Q1 would again see a decline in paid subscribers.

And then the results were published. For the first time in its history, Fubo delivered a sequential growth in paid subscribers and revenue in a Q1! The inflection point as been passed, the business momentum is stronger than the seasonality of sports. Looking ahead, with the Olympics, the soccer world cup qualifiers, the main leagues restarting everywhere, I expect massive growth in paid subscribers.

Now, onto the revenue side. The ARPU is approximately constant at around 69$/month since Q3 2020. The low seasonality of Q1 means that the relative share of ARPU due to the advertising is quite low compared to Q3 and Q4 last year. Which means that a great improvement of the subscription ARPU has been reached in Q1!

Now, when we'll go into Q3 and then Q4, with the absurd growth in number of subscribers and the massive gains from advertising, I'm expecting the ARPU to again grow. Expected advertising growth is 100% YOY.

And what happens when you combine massive subscribers and ARPU growth? You have massive results.

The cherries on the cake are:

1. Fubo betting which comes as a free version in Q3 and then paid version in Q4. It can be massive as Fubo will be the only player in the industry to control end to end the viewer/bettor experience.
2. International expansion, in Europe first probably, starting in 2022.
3. Accepting wagering in unconventional currencies.

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes – well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you’ll double your money. This isn’t some wishy washy bullshit oh it’s going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it’s just a question of when. How can I be so sure? They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.

Should you trust me? Am I financial advisor – good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips. Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago? We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can’t lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist? What the fuck does that mean – fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill. Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn’t just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine – kind of a big deal. They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year. Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe – think FDA is going to delay?

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no. They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted. Added bonus – Pfizer’s big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also – or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain’t going cheap. They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner. Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn’t allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth. The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes – former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – not piece of shit pharma we have here. Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks. You don’t have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear. No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential? Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities – hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men’s lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself. Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant’s drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued. MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down - whatever could they do with that cash? $44 a share wouldn’t even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down. With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in – remember this isn’t some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them. And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can’t see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone. FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they’ve already approved in new indications like this one. Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point. It’s down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason. FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density – the solution: they will monitor bone density. That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on – doesn’t that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer. Even if they don’t Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs.

These UAP’s exhibit unexplainable flight characteristics: near instantaneous acceleration, airplane/submersible hybrid characteristics, visual disappearance, odd acoustics, etc. Also, multiple “types” of craft have been observed. 

There are patents filed by the Navy for inertial mass reduction craft (basically creating a quantum vacuum around the craft to avoid air/water resistance; useful to go Mach 16+ in the atmosphere). Here’s the patent: [Triangular UAP Patent?](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10144532B2/en). Additionally, we have heard rumors (and they may just be rumors) of anti-gravity temporal displacement craft. These craft can accelerate by utilizing gravity waves, bend light through a gravity well (stealthy), and externally perceived time could be affected as well (think Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar) ([Gravity Wave Patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10322827B2/) ) This UAP sightings might be manned craft or something else, or a mixture of both. These patents could also be counter-espionage missions to throw foreign countries off true technological breakthroughs, but we do know there was a demo of the tech: [Navy acknowledging demo, but not production ready](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/37134/emails-show-navys-ufo-patents-went-through-significant-internal-review-resulted-in-a-demo)

Okay great, so what’s the play…

**Long-Raytheon ($RTX)** has the Advanced Targeting Forward Look Infrared Sensor, which can be utilized to track UAP’s. This technology has been out for over a decade.

([UFO Targeting Pod](https://sofrep.com/news/following-pentagon-admission-raytheon-touts-gear-ufo-spotter/))

**Long-Lockheed Martin ($LMT)** a major defense aerospace firm, which developed many prototypes over the years and is famous for the Skunkworks R&D lab. Former Senator Harry Reid believes Lockheed has UAP fragments in their possession ([UAP Fragments](https://deadline.com/2021/04/ufo-fragments-in-possession-lockheed-martin-says-harry-reid-1234748095/)). These fragments are believed to be made of an unknown metal/alloy, and potentially 3D printed at an atomic level.

**Long-Northrup Grumman ($NOC)** is a defense giant which developed the B-2 stealth bomber and is a contractor on multiple space infrastructure missions. They would be vital for advanced composites/metallurgy, advanced avionics, spaceflight, and tracking systems.

Additionally, we have no clear knowledge of where the Chinese and Russians are at with this technology. Maybe this is partly why we founded Space Force?

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes – well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you’ll double your money.  This isn’t some wishy washy bullshit oh it’s going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it’s just a question of when.  How can I be so sure?  They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.  

Should you trust me?  Am I financial advisor – good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips.  Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago?  We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can’t lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist?  What the fuck does that mean – fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill.  Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.  

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn’t just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine – kind of a big deal.  They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year.  Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe – think FDA is going to delay? 

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no.  They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted.  Added bonus – Pfizer’s big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also – or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain’t going cheap.  They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner.  Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn’t allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth.  The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes – former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – not piece of shit pharma we have here.  Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

Don't feel like writing a wall of text but want to warn others who are thinking of switching into them so I'm just going to bullet point problems I've had.  If you are with them already and feel so-so about them... there are better options out there.  Moving money is a pain in the ass but it might be worth it.

**Issues I've had with them**

* Margin approval is like pulling teeth.  They want to grill you to death for like half an hour and slowly increase your options approval one step at a time (honestly some of those guys seem like idiots and I'm not sure how they got their certifications).  If they don't like exactly how you answer questions even as an experienced trader that's been doing it for a while, they will delay your application by up to 6 months before you can try again.  That hasn't happened to me fortunately but apparently they do that so I'm always very anxious talking to them.  I have $600k ish with them in all my accounts and my risk per trade is typically capped at $50-60k.  I tend to have extra cash if I need to average down or add something to hedge my position.  Never used margin even though I have it since it's required to do a lot of different trades.

* Frequent outages (especially at market open), error messages, slow to load in the browser portal.  Desktop platform ""StreetSmart"" is terrible IMO but I suppose that is a matter of taste.  They're portal option trading is otherwise aright, I've seen better and worse but nothing to write home about.

* $1k recently mysteriously disappeared in my account.  They were quick to correct it and apparently it's some ""very rare"" programming error but who the fuck knows for sure.  I'm sure a lot of retards out there don't even notice if money is ever missing.

* Finally, something that has always bothered me is that their execution doesn't seem that good.  With options especially +/- a couple pennies (or nickel for larger contracts) can actually make a huge difference on your P&L for a trade.  They are THE LEADER in PFOF revenue.  Fuck them.


When I joined them close to 20 years ago, I worshiped Charles Schwab.  You can google him but he was Good Guy broker when no one cared about retail back in the day.

2185,,2021-05-21 17:50:01,t3_nhyj2a,,wallstreetbets," **Before I talk Technical Analysis (TA), it is important to understand the following:**

Technical Analysis is absolute meaningless astrology unless the strategies and indicators used are statistically/quantitatively *proven to be meaningful*. There are a lot of articles being published (and even shared here) about TLRY's TA - ignore them. They have zero weight on Tilray's future. Most of these chart patterns, strategies, theories, ideas, etc. taught in traditional trading education come from early 1900's anecdotal theories, which were nothing more than early, primitive attempts to identify patterns in markets. But, this is a story and an explanation for another time.

**In-Depth MACD Explanation:**

Since it's a popular retail indicator, most of you probably already know what the Moving Average Converence/Divergence (MACD) is. However, it's usually not well understood. The MACD takes in three settings for Moving Averages (MA) and the two lines plotted on the indicator are calculated as so:

MACD Line: Short MA - Long MA

Signal Line: Signal MA of the MACD Line

This is actually an incredibly clever way of measuring momentum and trend-following. By taking the difference between two different MA periods, we get a second-derivative (i.e. acceleration). By default, the MACD is calculated an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and with period settings (12, 26, 9).

**So, onto TLRY's** ***potential*** **momentum shift:**

*Note that I said ""potential,"" because the land of quantitative/algorithmic trading is nothing more than a probability game developed through hypothesis testing.*

Today, TLRY experienced a MACD crossover with MACD settings (SMA, 28, 48, 32). Why these settings? Because I ran a statistical backtest on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and simulated over 140,000 settings in an attempt to find the best practical combination to signal price change over the next few days via MACD crossover (Fun fact: using a Simple Moving Average (SMA) *always* yields better results, no matter what symbol or asset class).

If I were to buy ever MACD (SMA, 28, 48, 32) crossover at the daily closing price and hold for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days, what would my results be? Here's the results for the SPY since 2003:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k8lmq168hi071.png?width=1885&format=png&auto=webp&s=1af5f7ce7e179b59a18a198aaab1447e6177afc8

Positive mean returns and a high win frequency are significant, with the 1st day after buying being the most important. So, now that we've seen it's general significance in large-cap, what are the backtested results for TLRY? Well, it's tough because Tilray hasn't had a publicly traded stock for very long, so the sample size is insufficiently small. But, take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/6d1lvnx9hi071.png?width=1932&format=png&auto=webp&s=24595178d1e6e808074bd46a7e8ad6a8442b3e98

It still holds some significance with the positive means and win frequencies. But obviously with only 9 crossovers happening in TLRY's lifetime, we can't take these numbers and fit them to any model.

**So, using the most statistically effective MACD period settings, TLRY** ***may*** **be getting a shift in momentum here fairly soon!**

I understand that my initial claims for the (28, 48, 32) settings were only tested on the SPY, and Tilray isn't large-cap growth. There is still more testing and solidifying to do. BUT, I figured you apes who are still holding are continually waiting for a confirmation bias, so here you go :)",nhyj2a,Tilray (TLRY) MACD Momentum Shift - Quantitative TA

You probably havent heard about [The Lion Electric Company](https://thelionelectric.com/). Its because its only been 2 weeks since they are officially listed on both [NYSE](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy5d2/nyselev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [TSX](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy67g/tsxlev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). Before that, you could only buy the SPAC's stock Northern Genesis Acquisition. This is when I first bought most of my shares.

Basic infos about the stock:
- currently worth 19 U$D (+30% this week and its the highest ever with ticker LEV)
- Market Cap 3,5 billion USD


What does the Lion do? They do 100% electric trucks and busses.
And yes there is a lot of competition in the EV market, but not that much for trucks. Lion doesnt make cars, only trucks. They also already have orders from Amazon and scholar institution. 


What makes me think LEV is a buy



1. Lion is going to open a manufacturing facility in Illinois worth about $500M. The Illinois government is financing $70M for this. When full operational, the factory will be able to produce 20,000 vehicles per year. It will be the biggest of its kind in the US. Lion says they plan they start production in mid-2022. 



2. Lion is also opening a battery factory in Quebec (Canada). The government is financing 100M CAD (roughly 82M USD) to help them build it. This means that not only Lion will make 100% electric trucks, they will also produce their own batteries which they could potentially sell to other businesses in the future. But most important is that they wont have to buy it from another. 



3. Canada will no longer allow to sell new gasoline vehicles by 2035 (it doesnt concern used cars). This is in 15 years (only? Lol). But a lot of companies already started their transition to 100% EV. And all the state owned business will buy from a Canadian company, because thats how Canada works most of the time. All the school busses and normal busses have to be replaced, and we know they wont buy from a Chinese company when there is a Canadian one available. So its probably going to be Lion Electric. You should also note that some private companies like Loblaws are already transitioning to EV, they bought a lot of Tesla trucks recently. However, Lion's trucks are not only Canadian but also expected to be cheaper and good quality. 



4. Lion has clients
Amazon made a contract with Lion to buy 2,500 trucks over 5 years. But theres a downside: Lion is obliged to reserve 500 trucks per year for Amazon, while Amazon isnt obliged to actually buy them. It means that if the trucks quality is deceiptive, its possible Amazon would not buy them. This would of course be horrible for the stock.
But Amazon isnt the only big client: First Student bought 260 busses from Lion. It was announced this week, and I can still feel the +30% impact on my portfolio. Everyday LEV went higher than the previous one. 



5. LEV has a huge potential for long term profit. I personally think the stock could reach 25USD before the end of the year, but it could be even more. And when the Illinois facility will finally open, the stock should go higher than 30. If you look up the Northern Genesis stock history (the SPAC that merged with Lion 3 weeks ago), you will see the stock was at 30+ in January, but it fell with all the EV market. If you dont buy LEV this year, it might be too late. Of course the stock will be way higher in 5 years than now, but the more profit the better, right?



So in my opinion, you will make 100% to 300% within 3-4 years with this stock. But I am not an expert and you dont have to trust me. I trust myself and mostly trust The Lion Electric Company. I am already making small profit from this investment.


Have a good day and may your portfolio be green!",nhyn43,LEV: Lion Electric is the underdog

Now, there are two narratives if you are interested in buying SNDL stock. First is the bullish one that points to the ample cash on its balance sheet. As I noted in a previous article, SNDL is becoming like the Berkshire Hathaway of the marijuana industry. The company is investing and lending to several smaller marijuana companies. Also, it could expand into the U.S. adult-use market.


As for TLRY, it looks like a good marijuana company to buy from a business perspective. The company is a marijuana powerhouse with international operations and both medical and adult-use businesses. Also, count on the post-merger synergies and economies of scale to work for the new TLRY.



To sum it up, from a purely business perspective, you will bet on TLRY. However, if you are looking at betting on an investment vehicle that can capitalize on the troubles of some of the smaller marijuana companies, SNDL will fit the bill.",nhzt5b,"SNDL vs TLRY, comment your favorite"

# Company Overview

**LendingTree (NASDAQ: TREE)** is America’s largest online marketplace connecting lenders and borrowers. LendingTree empowers lenders to shop for financial services the same way one would shop for hotel stays or airline tickets- comparing multiple offers from a nationwide network of over 800 partners that offer their customers services such as mortgage loans, mortgage refinances, auto loans, personal loans, business loans, and much more. Their service also provides lenders with free credit scores, monitoring and improvements, and etc.

   * Nikko Asset Management Americas Inc. raised holdings by 15.4% during 4Q
* Insider Transactions:
   * Independent Director G. Thompson purchase 1.4M worth of share at about $282/share
   * Suggests a positive outlook for the company as the price was bought above the price it was trading at then

# Industry Overview and Outlook

* Low-interest rates have fueled consumer demand for refinancing existing debt and access to new debt
* Industry consolidation is occurring due to shrinking margins and increased regulatory costs
   * Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act to encourage consumer lending
* Strong economy coupled with strong employment numbers have led to a surge in home sales
   * Pandemic-drriven demand sent total home sales to the highest since 2006
   * 5.6% increase YoY for homes sold
   * Sales in January 2020 were 22% stronger than in December 2019
* 51% of mortgage lenders are non-banks
   * 5 of the largest mortgage lenders in the U.S are non-banks
* Projected $73.7B in loan origination for 2022
   * $35.6B from personal loans, $13.6B from small and medium entrepreneur loans, and $24.5B from refinancing student debt
   * Approx. 79.3% growth since loan origination value of $41.4B from 2017
* Pandemic-driven demand sent total home sales to the highest since 2006

# Investment Thesis I: Established Leader in the Marketplace

LendingTree’s competitive advantages in the marketplace differentiate them from other loan or insurance comparison-shopping marketplaces.

* **Speed:** easy-use; apply for loans in minutes and lock-in rates
* **Convenience:** search and apply for quotes 24/7 from anywhere in the world
* **Competitive Rates:** average buyer saves $125-$163 per month for interest
   * LendingTree has saved refinanced borrowers the most in San Francisco, San Diego and Los Angeles with median savings of $80,211, $77,740 and $73,954 respectively
   * Even in cities with  refinancing savings like Detroit present median savings of $23,409

# Investment Thesis II: Insurance Growth

* The insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and the number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Refer to chart ‘Segment Revenue’
   * Insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Expected revenue growth of 30% + compared to 2Q2020
* Acquisitions of QuoteWizard in 4Q2018 and ValuePenguin in 1Q2019 allowed them to enhance their insurance products 
   * QuoteWizard – one of the largest insurance comparison marketplaces in the growing online insurance advertising market
      * This acquisition established LendingTree as a leading player in the online insurance advertising industry while also allowing them to diversify their financial services category
      * Significant portion of their revenue growth in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was driven by their insurance leads business from this acquisition 
   * ValuePenguin – personal finance website that offers consumers objective analysis on variety of financial topics from insurance to credit cards
      * This acquisition provided immense value to insurance carriers and agents through their high-quality content and SEO capability – allowing them further scale in the insurance space
* New Medicare category for insurance growth showed significant promise during their first open-enrollment period in the 4Q2020
   * Presents a significant opportunity for their insurance segment 

# Major Risks 

**Consumer Demand Risk –** a general increase in interest rates may affect the ability of LendingTree’s mortgage Network Partners to close loans which will translate to lower revenues for LendingTree and ultimately affect their financial position

**Interest Rate Risk –** The Federal Reserve is currently printing out more money in order to keep the markets afloat due to COVID-19. In the long-term, this will cause inflation and the decreasing value of the USD. To combat this, the Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates

# Final Thoughts

The positive industry outlook and the prospective insurance segment of LendingTree that has generated high growth YoY strengthen analysts’ recommendations to BUY. Given a stock price forecast projecting a median price target of $320 (60.7% upside) and a low-price target of $200 (0.5% upside), I believe this stock still has a low of room for growth as they continue to diversify its revenue streams and expanding their financial services. Furthermore, I’ve provided a chart of analyst recommendations retrieved from CNN Business that strengthens the recommendation to BUY.

Large open interest & volume on the June 18 expiration date, any reason why there's x10 times the normal open interest on the options expiring June 18? over 15M shares to cover options in the money as of today

GOLD is a good value company, with over 12B in revenue in 2020 & market cap is only 3.5x last year's revenue. Over 2B/yr in earnings the last 2 years & 5B in cash. Most of the business is in Gold mining 20% is in copper. Commodity prices keep climbing higher, so it's a good hedge for inflation.

For full disclosure I own several calls at the $20, $22, $23  expiring in June-Sept as well as shares of GOLD for the long to medium term. I'm no financial advisor and I'm likely wrong.

The stock has been seeing some resistance at $25 lately, but if the price of gold per ounce ($1881 currently) crosses the $1890... June is going to be a very good month for Barrick Gold. It's a quality company in my opinion & the market is at a tipping point, so it's a good safety net (maybe...)

This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let’s go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don’t need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there’s a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

There is little difference in their lines of business at the moment, margins are similar, products are similar. There’s very little differentiation, he’ll they’re in the same city. UWMC has had a better post-earnings period not because their top line YOY growth was so good or even indicative of something remotely possible to sustain moving forward, but really just because of the dividend and chest pounding against RKT.

I have a position in both, and before either camp starts screaming about how one is more revolutionary, or has better blah blah blah, realize that the only thing driving price action for either is public sentiment. UWMC declared a regular dividend while RKT only a special. 

Next week, either Jay Farner gets flashy (new dividend, massive auto rollout, something new) and starts publicly pushing back against Ishbia, or RKT continues downward. I think it’s 50/50 but looks ripe for anyone looking for a straddle yolo, with IV not as bad as it was before.

It might be to their advantage to do so because they are able to profit off of the availability of COMEX -- but at what price?  
In other words, saving COMEX yet again may be becoming just too *expensive* for JPM's bean counters/risk managers.  
Or maybe they simply don't have the available unencumbered silver to do this with any longer.  
JPM and their billion ounce mountain of silver may be a paper tiger.

Lets dign in !

**Comex silver warehouse .... another 1,000,000 oz is OUT OF THE VAULT, 43,000,000 oz is gone since the silverbacks arrived. This time it is all HSBC bank. And what did big powerful JP Morgan do? Nothing!! Maybe all their silver eligible is spoken for.** 

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418.
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there’s at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don’t have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.

For instance, say I deposit funds sufficient to push account balance over $25 k (at least 2 business days) before I PDT over the course of a few weeks. After those weeks are over, I cash out, bringing my balance back below $25k, but I no longer PDT after doing so. 

In that scenario, would I still be flagged as a PDT and would the account become frozen for 90 days as soon as I took my money out, leaving me unable to make non PDT trades with any remaining funds? Basically what I’m getting at, is that once I’m flagged as a PDT must I always keep the account above $25k from there on to avoid a penalty, or could I go back below $25k, provided I did not PDT’d after doing so?",,

The vast majority of weeks with expiring options in a bull run have downtrends, where MMs try to kill the value of call contracts written. Typically we then resume the upturn the week afterwards. A few notable exceptions however, like February where the week after OpEx continued the bloodbath. I doubt we see volatility like that next week (and to be perfectly honest I think next week can go either way, I'm not really sure which), but it could very feasibly see a re-test of 400 on SPY and the NAS retracing another % or two. Think of it this way .. the market needs catalysts to run up or down. The weeks anticipating incredible ERs give reason to run up; a week where Options being ITM presents risk gives a reason to run down. A lot of the short term moves are psychology based.

This causes the market to go down even though retail is buying because the buy order is go to sh-itadel and Sh-itadel fills them either with fake shares or off market shares.

This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let’s go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don’t need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there’s a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

Overall, I’m bullish and have over 30 call contracts expiring this July 🚀🚀🚀",nhdnzi,Bull Cruise $CCL primed to explode 🚀🚀📈🚀

UWMC has had a better post-earnings period not because their top line YOY growth was so good or even indicative of something remotely possible to sustain moving forward, but really just because of the dividend and chest pounding against RKT.

I have a position in both, and before either camp starts screaming about how one is more revolutionary, or has better blah blah blah, realize that the only thing driving price action for either is public sentiment. UWMC declared a regular dividend while RKT only a special. 

Next week, either Jay Farner gets flashy (new dividend, massive auto rollout, something new) and starts publicly pushing back against Ishbia, or RKT continues downward. I think it’s 50/50 but looks ripe for anyone looking for a straddle yolo, with IV not as bad as it was before.

It might be to their advantage to do so because they are able to profit off of the availability of COMEX -- but at what price?  
In other words, saving COMEX yet again may be becoming just too *expensive* for JPM's bean counters/risk managers.  
Or maybe they simply don't have the available unencumbered silver to do this with any longer.  
JPM and their billion ounce mountain of silver may be a paper tiger.

**Comex silver warehouse .... another 1,000,000 oz is OUT OF THE VAULT, 43,000,000 oz is gone since the silverbacks arrived. This time it is all HSBC bank. And what did big powerful JP Morgan do? Nothing!! Maybe all their silver eligible is spoken for.** 

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418.
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

Inflation is gonna destroy non-asset holders. I’m a bit worried about discount retail (5 below, DG, Dollar Tree) holding up because the business models are predicated on selling commodities at a certain price point. If commodity prices skyrocket dollar tree especially is gonna have a tough time adjusting since literally everything in their store is a dollar. So I think the better bet is to buy the actual companies that create goods that the poor are capable of buying (since inflation will eradicate much of the middle class.) Vizio products would never be sold in one of these stores but they sell really cheap TVs with internet accessibility. They sell a really good product considering the price point. I check their books and it’s a profitable company that’s been improving margins that last two years. Pretty low market cap so I wouldn’t be shocked if a larger company sought to buy it in the future.

2667,,2021-05-21 07:40:32,t3_nhmv7n,,wallstreetbets,"Ford is great value investment considering it will compete with TESLA for EV market - Most of bear case is ford debt and they are 100% wrong. Please read below article.

**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    
**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford’s finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford’s automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford’s $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford’s $160 billion debt load.

From old post:

1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

I’m overall bearish on this company, as founder Richard Branson and SPAC-backer Chamath Palihapitiya have both sold basically all of their shares. Cathie Woods doesn’t even own it for ARK. 

I want to buy puts in anticipation of a drop Monday, this seems like the most likely outcome to me. Whether the launch is a failure or people just sell the news after a big move, it seems unlikely that it continues to rally Monday. There’s a lot of bag holders who bought at $40-60 a couple months ago that would love to get out if it bounces which would theoretically limit its possible gains Monday. On the chance the test flight greatly exceeds expectations or there is another announcement included along side the test, the stock could fly however. I feel that this is a slim but non-zero possibility. Basically whichever way it moves, it’s going to move hard. June 4th options have an IV of 165% per thinkorswim. 

My question is whether I am better off buying straight puts on $SPCE or if I should buy some sort of call/put spread to hedge my downside in the event the stock continues to fly Monday. My main concern is making the right move and still getting IV crushed. I’m looking at 6/4/21 $20 puts, or a spread at the same strike and expiry. In your opinions, is that a smart move or is there something else I should be considering? I’m still relatively new to trading options. 

Thanks for your input!

I suspect Nokia will have a favorable win rate as others try to compete with ReefShark. Nokia’s AI-enabled chip ReefShark which is used to power Nokia’s 5G base stations made up 44% of 5G sales. ReefShark is on track to reach 70% of 5G sales by year’s end. ReefShark is Nokia’s most recent semiconductor that powers its 5G base stations.

The ReefShark chipset is smaller, decreasing the antenna size by half, which makes these base stations less bulky and obtrusive.

2673,,2021-05-21 11:44:07,t3_nhqhhk,,wallstreetbets,"Explosive fires have started everywhere already. Stock markets are on fire and so are property markets, as well as bond and debt markets. The problem is that fires are initially explosive but always end up implosive. 

How predictable events are (and people). This is particularly true in the world economy. Empires come and go, economies boom and bust and new currencies come and without fail always go. All this happens with regularity. 

&#x200B;

 Everything really on fire :

 We have seen  about inflation running wild and it is not just happening in stocks. Property markets are literarily exploding, especially the high end. We see this all over the world and not just in the US. In the UK for example, HSBC stated that March saw the highest number of mortgages EVER issued. In Sweden properties sell for up to 40% above asking price in a frenzied bidding war and second hand leisure boats are in such demand that they cost virtually the same as a new boat. And if you want a new boat, there is none available until 2022. It also seems that people are desperate for company after the lockdowns as prices for puppies in the UK are up to 100% higher than last year.

 Yes, everything is really on fire as people are desperate to just spend, spend, spend after a year of lockdowns and restrictions. 

 AN ECONOMIC BUBBLE OF AIR

 Since air is free, governments can produce unlimited amounts of it. And without exception, gullible people want to believe that it is actually real money and not just empty air. The beauty for the government is that they can just produce and borrow trillions of dollars at ZERO cost. And by manipulating interest rates they can borrow this money also at virtually ZERO cost. 

 So first the government manufactures the money at no cost and then they pay NOTHING for the privilege of borrowing that money. 

 The money obviously creates massive bubbles in stocks, bonds, houses, used cars , boats, puppies and other massively overvalued investments and consumer items. 

 Just look at how, for example, the Dow has gone up **exponentially and parabolically** **in the last year in an historically unprecedented straight line.** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lnjdj8xvlg071.png?width=461&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a5b514632f262f311d158e14416251b98f6d00e

 

**US Federal Debt up 74X**  
**Total US debt up “only” 49X**  
**M2 Money Supply up 29X>**

**Debt to GDP 1971: 37% – 2021: 127%**

 Bubbles are called bubbles because they consist of air. And when bubbles become too big, they ALWAYS and without fail burst and implode. 

 Technically markets are giving very clear signals that THE END IS NIGH.

Whether that means days weeks or a few months, is totally irrelevant. We know that we are at the end of the most remarkable period in history in regards to money, investments and the economy.

 GOLD, SILVER AND WEALTH PRESERVATION

Gold  and Silver  have not at all reflected the massive creation of money in the last 50 years. That catchup phase is likely to start very soon based on both fundamentals and technicals. 

As regards securing your finances in periods of crisis, gold and silver have always been critical to hold.

 Everyone can afford some gold or silver. An ounce of silver is $28 and one gramme of gold is $50. So saving in precious metals will not only be very useful but essential at whatever level you can afford.

 The upside potential for gold and silver is multiples of the current prices and that is at today’s price levels. Higher inflation could take the metals to unfathomable heights.

2675,,2021-05-21 12:45:14,t3_nhrmu8,,wallstreetbets,"FuboTV posted its Q1 results on the 11th. Seasonality in sports is obviously huge, with Q1 and Q2 being the worst periods of the season.

Consequently, there was always a sequential decline in the number of subscribers in Q1 and Q2 in 2019 and 2020. Typically between -8 and -9% sequentially. Given the amazing performance that was achieved in Q3 and Q4 last year, it was heavily expected that this Q1 would again see a decline in paid subscribers.

And then the results were published. For the first time in its history, Fubo delivered a sequential growth in paid subscribers and revenue in a Q1! The inflection point as been passed, the business momentum is stronger than the seasonality of sports. Looking ahead, with the Olympics, the soccer world cup qualifiers, the main leagues restarting everywhere, I expect massive growth in paid subscribers.

Now, onto the revenue side. The ARPU is approximately constant at around 69$/month since Q3 2020. The low seasonality of Q1 means that the relative share of ARPU due to the advertising is quite low compared to Q3 and Q4 last year. Which means that a great improvement of the subscription ARPU has been reached in Q1!

Now, when we'll go into Q3 and then Q4, with the absurd growth in number of subscribers and the massive gains from advertising, I'm expecting the ARPU to again grow. Expected advertising growth is 100% YOY.

And what happens when you combine massive subscribers and ARPU growth? You have massive results.

The cherries on the cake are:

1. Fubo betting which comes as a free version in Q3 and then paid version in Q4. It can be massive as Fubo will be the only player in the industry to control end to end the viewer/bettor experience.
2. International expansion, in Europe first probably, starting in 2022.
3. Accepting wagering in unconventional currencies.

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes – well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you’ll double your money. This isn’t some wishy washy bullshit oh it’s going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it’s just a question of when. How can I be so sure? They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.

Should you trust me? Am I financial advisor – good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips. Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago? We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can’t lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist? What the fuck does that mean – fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill. Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn’t just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine – kind of a big deal. They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year. Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe – think FDA is going to delay?

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no. They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted. Added bonus – Pfizer’s big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also – or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain’t going cheap. They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner.

Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant’s drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down - whatever could they do with that cash? $44 a share wouldn’t even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down.

And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can’t see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone. FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they’ve already approved in new indications like this one. Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point. It’s down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason.

These UAP’s exhibit unexplainable flight characteristics: near instantaneous acceleration, airplane/submersible hybrid characteristics, visual disappearance, odd acoustics, etc. Also, multiple “types” of craft have been observed. 

There are patents filed by the Navy for inertial mass reduction craft (basically creating a quantum vacuum around the craft to avoid air/water resistance; useful to go Mach 16+ in the atmosphere). Here’s the patent: [Triangular UAP Patent?](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10144532B2/en). Additionally, we have heard rumors (and they may just be rumors) of anti-gravity temporal displacement craft. These craft can accelerate by utilizing gravity waves, bend light through a gravity well (stealthy), and externally perceived time could be affected as well (think Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar) ([Gravity Wave Patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10322827B2/) ) This UAP sightings might be manned craft or something else, or a mixture of both. These patents could also be counter-espionage missions to throw foreign countries off true technological breakthroughs, but we do know there was a demo of the tech: [Navy acknowledging demo, but not production ready](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/37134/emails-show-navys-ufo-patents-went-through-significant-internal-review-resulted-in-a-demo)

**Long-Raytheon ($RTX)** has the Advanced Targeting Forward Look Infrared Sensor, which can be utilized to track UAP’s. This technology has been out for over a decade.

([UFO Targeting Pod](https://sofrep.com/news/following-pentagon-admission-raytheon-touts-gear-ufo-spotter/))

**Long-Lockheed Martin ($LMT)** a major defense aerospace firm, which developed many prototypes over the years and is famous for the Skunkworks R&D lab.

These fragments are believed to be made of an unknown metal/alloy, and potentially 3D printed at an atomic level.

**Long-Northrup Grumman ($NOC)** is a defense giant which developed the B-2 stealth bomber and is a contractor on multiple space infrastructure missions. They would be vital for advanced composites/metallurgy, advanced avionics, spaceflight, and tracking systems.

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes – well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you’ll double your money.  This isn’t some wishy washy bullshit oh it’s going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it’s just a question of when.  How can I be so sure?  They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.  

Should you trust me?  Am I financial advisor – good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips.  Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago?  We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can’t lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist?  What the fuck does that mean – fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill.  Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.  

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn’t just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine – kind of a big deal.  They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year.  Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe – think FDA is going to delay? 

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no.  They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted.  Added bonus – Pfizer’s big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also – or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain’t going cheap.  They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner.  Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn’t allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth.

Don't feel like writing a wall of text but want to warn others who are thinking of switching into them so I'm just going to bullet point problems I've had.  If you are with them already and feel so-so about them... there are better options out there.  Moving money is a pain in the ass but it might be worth it.

**Issues I've had with them**

* Margin approval is like pulling teeth.  They want to grill you to death for like half an hour and slowly increase your options approval one step at a time (honestly some of those guys seem like idiots and I'm not sure how they got their certifications).  If they don't like exactly how you answer questions even as an experienced trader that's been doing it for a while, they will delay your application by up to 6 months before you can try again.  That hasn't happened to me fortunately but apparently they do that so I'm always very anxious talking to them.  I have $600k ish with them in all my accounts and my risk per trade is typically capped at $50-60k.  I tend to have extra cash if I need to average down or add something to hedge my position.  Never used margin even though I have it since it's required to do a lot of different trades.

* Frequent outages (especially at market open), error messages, slow to load in the browser portal.  Desktop platform ""StreetSmart"" is terrible IMO but I suppose that is a matter of taste.  They're portal option trading is otherwise aright, I've seen better and worse but nothing to write home about.

* $1k recently mysteriously disappeared in my account.  They were quick to correct it and apparently it's some ""very rare"" programming error but who the fuck knows for sure.  I'm sure a lot of retards out there don't even notice if money is ever missing.

* Finally, something that has always bothered me is that their execution doesn't seem that good.  With options especially +/- a couple pennies (or nickel for larger contracts) can actually make a huge difference on your P&L for a trade.  They are THE LEADER in PFOF revenue.  Fuck them.


When I joined them close to 20 years ago, I worshiped Charles Schwab.  You can google him but he was Good Guy broker when no one cared about retail back in the day.

2702,,2021-05-21 17:50:01,t3_nhyj2a,,wallstreetbets," **Before I talk Technical Analysis (TA), it is important to understand the following:**

Technical Analysis is absolute meaningless astrology unless the strategies and indicators used are statistically/quantitatively *proven to be meaningful*. There are a lot of articles being published (and even shared here) about TLRY's TA - ignore them. They have zero weight on Tilray's future. Most of these chart patterns, strategies, theories, ideas, etc. taught in traditional trading education come from early 1900's anecdotal theories, which were nothing more than early, primitive attempts to identify patterns in markets. But, this is a story and an explanation for another time.

**In-Depth MACD Explanation:**

Since it's a popular retail indicator, most of you probably already know what the Moving Average Converence/Divergence (MACD) is. However, it's usually not well understood. The MACD takes in three settings for Moving Averages (MA) and the two lines plotted on the indicator are calculated as so:

MACD Line: Short MA - Long MA

Signal Line: Signal MA of the MACD Line

This is actually an incredibly clever way of measuring momentum and trend-following. By taking the difference between two different MA periods, we get a second-derivative (i.e. acceleration). By default, the MACD is calculated an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and with period settings (12, 26, 9).

**So, onto TLRY's** ***potential*** **momentum shift:**

*Note that I said ""potential,"" because the land of quantitative/algorithmic trading is nothing more than a probability game developed through hypothesis testing.*

Today, TLRY experienced a MACD crossover with MACD settings (SMA, 28, 48, 32). Why these settings? Because I ran a statistical backtest on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and simulated over 140,000 settings in an attempt to find the best practical combination to signal price change over the next few days via MACD crossover (Fun fact: using a Simple Moving Average (SMA) *always* yields better results, no matter what symbol or asset class).

If I were to buy ever MACD (SMA, 28, 48, 32) crossover at the daily closing price and hold for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days, what would my results be? Here's the results for the SPY since 2003:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k8lmq168hi071.png?width=1885&format=png&auto=webp&s=1af5f7ce7e179b59a18a198aaab1447e6177afc8

Positive mean returns and a high win frequency are significant, with the 1st day after buying being the most important. So, now that we've seen it's general significance in large-cap, what are the backtested results for TLRY? Well, it's tough because Tilray hasn't had a publicly traded stock for very long, so the sample size is insufficiently small. But, take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/6d1lvnx9hi071.png?width=1932&format=png&auto=webp&s=24595178d1e6e808074bd46a7e8ad6a8442b3e98

It still holds some significance with the positive means and win frequencies. But obviously with only 9 crossovers happening in TLRY's lifetime, we can't take these numbers and fit them to any model.

**So, using the most statistically effective MACD period settings, TLRY** ***may*** **be getting a shift in momentum here fairly soon!**

I understand that my initial claims for the (28, 48, 32) settings were only tested on the SPY, and Tilray isn't large-cap growth. There is still more testing and solidifying to do. BUT, I figured you apes who are still holding are continually waiting for a confirmation bias, so here you go :)",nhyj2a,Tilray (TLRY) MACD Momentum Shift - Quantitative TA

You probably havent heard about [The Lion Electric Company](https://thelionelectric.com/). Its because its only been 2 weeks since they are officially listed on both [NYSE](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy5d2/nyselev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [TSX](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy67g/tsxlev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). Before that, you could only buy the SPAC's stock Northern Genesis Acquisition. This is when I first bought most of my shares.

Basic infos about the stock:
- currently worth 19 U$D (+30% this week and its the highest ever with ticker LEV)
- Market Cap 3,5 billion USD


What does the Lion do? They do 100% electric trucks and busses.
And yes there is a lot of competition in the EV market, but not that much for trucks. Lion doesnt make cars, only trucks. They also already have orders from Amazon and scholar institution. 


What makes me think LEV is a buy



1. Lion is going to open a manufacturing facility in Illinois worth about $500M. The Illinois government is financing $70M for this. When full operational, the factory will be able to produce 20,000 vehicles per year. It will be the biggest of its kind in the US. Lion says they plan they start production in mid-2022. 



2. Lion is also opening a battery factory in Quebec (Canada). The government is financing 100M CAD (roughly 82M USD) to help them build it. This means that not only Lion will make 100% electric trucks, they will also produce their own batteries which they could potentially sell to other businesses in the future. But most important is that they wont have to buy it from another. 



3. Canada will no longer allow to sell new gasoline vehicles by 2035 (it doesnt concern used cars). This is in 15 years (only? Lol). But a lot of companies already started their transition to 100% EV. And all the state owned business will buy from a Canadian company, because thats how Canada works most of the time. All the school busses and normal busses have to be replaced, and we know they wont buy from a Chinese company when there is a Canadian one available. So its probably going to be Lion Electric. You should also note that some private companies like Loblaws are already transitioning to EV, they bought a lot of Tesla trucks recently. However, Lion's trucks are not only Canadian but also expected to be cheaper and good quality. 



4. Lion has clients
Amazon made a contract with Lion to buy 2,500 trucks over 5 years. But theres a downside: Lion is obliged to reserve 500 trucks per year for Amazon, while Amazon isnt obliged to actually buy them. It means that if the trucks quality is deceiptive, its possible Amazon would not buy them. This would of course be horrible for the stock.
But Amazon isnt the only big client: First Student bought 260 busses from Lion. It was announced this week, and I can still feel the +30% impact on my portfolio. Everyday LEV went higher than the previous one. 



5. LEV has a huge potential for long term profit. I personally think the stock could reach 25USD before the end of the year, but it could be even more. And when the Illinois facility will finally open, the stock should go higher than 30. If you look up the Northern Genesis stock history (the SPAC that merged with Lion 3 weeks ago), you will see the stock was at 30+ in January, but it fell with all the EV market. If you dont buy LEV this year, it might be too late. Of course the stock will be way higher in 5 years than now, but the more profit the better, right?



So in my opinion, you will make 100% to 300% within 3-4 years with this stock. But I am not an expert and you dont have to trust me. I trust myself and mostly trust The Lion Electric Company. I am already making small profit from this investment.


Have a good day and may your portfolio be green!",nhyn43,LEV: Lion Electric is the underdog

Now, there are two narratives if you are interested in buying SNDL stock. First is the bullish one that points to the ample cash on its balance sheet. SNDL is becoming like the Berkshire Hathaway of the marijuana industry. The company is investing and lending to several smaller marijuana companies. Also, it could expand into the U.S. adult-use market.


As for TLRY, it looks like a good marijuana company to buy from a business perspective. The company is a marijuana powerhouse with international operations and both medical and adult-use businesses. Also, count on the post-merger synergies and economies of scale to work for the new TLRY.



To sum it up, from a purely business perspective, you will bet on TLRY. However, if you are looking at betting on an investment vehicle that can capitalize on the troubles of some of the smaller marijuana companies, SNDL will fit the bill.",nhzt5b,"SNDL vs TLRY, comment your favorite"

# Company Overview

   * Nikko Asset Management Americas Inc. raised holdings by 15.4% during 4Q
* Insider Transactions:
   * Independent Director G. Thompson purchase 1.4M worth of share at about $282/share
   * Suggests a positive outlook for the company as the price was bought above the price it was trading at then

# Industry Overview and Outlook

* Low-interest rates have fueled consumer demand for refinancing existing debt and access to new debt
* Industry consolidation is occurring due to shrinking margins and increased regulatory costs
   * Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act to encourage consumer lending
* Strong economy coupled with strong employment numbers have led to a surge in home sales
   * Pandemic-drriven demand sent total home sales to the highest since 2006
   * 5.6% increase YoY for homes sold

   * Approx. 79.3% growth since loan origination value of $41.4B from 2017
* Pandemic-driven demand sent total home sales to the highest since 2006

# Investment Thesis I: Established Leader in the Marketplace

LendingTree’s competitive advantages in the marketplace differentiate them from other loan or insurance comparison-shopping marketplaces.

* **Speed:** easy-use; apply for loans in minutes and lock-in rates
* **Convenience:** search and apply for quotes 24/7 from anywhere in the world
* **Competitive Rates:** average buyer saves $125-$163 per month for interest
   * LendingTree has saved refinanced borrowers the most in San Francisco, San Diego and Los Angeles with median savings of $80,211, $77,740 and $73,954 respectively
   * Even in cities with  refinancing savings like Detroit present median savings of $23,409

# Investment Thesis II: Insurance Growth

* The insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and the number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Refer to chart ‘Segment Revenue’
   * Insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Expected revenue growth of 30% + compared to 2Q2020
* Acquisitions of QuoteWizard in 4Q2018 and ValuePenguin in 1Q2019 allowed them to enhance their insurance products 
   * QuoteWizard – one of the largest insurance comparison marketplaces in the growing online insurance advertising market
      * This acquisition established LendingTree as a leading player in the online insurance advertising industry while also allowing them to diversify their financial services category
      * Significant portion of their revenue growth in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was driven by their insurance leads business from this acquisition 
   * ValuePenguin – personal finance website that offers consumers objective analysis on variety of financial topics from insurance to credit cards
      * This acquisition provided immense value to insurance carriers and agents through their high-quality content and SEO capability – allowing them further scale in the insurance space
* New Medicare category for insurance growth showed significant promise during their first open-enrollment period in the 4Q2020
   * Presents a significant opportunity for their insurance segment 

# Major Risks 

**Consumer Demand Risk –** a general increase in interest rates may affect the ability of LendingTree’s mortgage Network Partners to close loans which will translate to lower revenues for LendingTree and ultimately affect their financial position

**Interest Rate Risk –** The Federal Reserve is currently printing out more money in order to keep the markets afloat due to COVID-19. In the long-term, this will cause inflation and the decreasing value of the USD. To combat this, the Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates

# Final Thoughts

The positive industry outlook and the prospective insurance segment of LendingTree that has generated high growth YoY strengthen analysts’ recommendations to BUY. Given a stock price forecast projecting a median price target of $320 (60.7% upside) and a low-price target of $200 (0.5% upside), I believe this stock still has a low of room for growth as they continue to diversify its revenue streams and expanding their financial services. Furthermore, I’ve provided a chart of analyst recommendations retrieved from CNN Business that strengthens the recommendation to BUY.

Large open interest & volume on the June 18 expiration date, any reason why there's x10 times the normal open interest on the options expiring June 18? over 15M shares to cover options in the money as of today

GOLD is a good value company, with over 12B in revenue in 2020 & market cap is only 3.5x last year's revenue. Over 2B/yr in earnings the last 2 years & 5B in cash. Most of the business is in Gold mining 20% is in copper. Commodity prices keep climbing higher, so it's a good hedge for inflation.

For full disclosure I own several calls at the $20, $22, $23  expiring in June-Sept as well as shares of GOLD for the long to medium term. I'm no financial advisor and I'm likely wrong.

The stock has been seeing some resistance at $25 lately, but if the price of gold per ounce ($1881 currently) crosses the $1890... June is going to be a very good month for Barrick Gold. It's a quality company in my opinion & the market is at a tipping point, so it's a good safety net (maybe...)

They're a bunch of terrified children pretending to have diamond hands, but they never educated themselves to have the security to actually *be* a diamond hand.

So they make up for their insecurities and lack of self education by downvoting anything that goes against their confirmation bias. From their perspective everyone is lying to them anyways so they may  as well just believe whatever.

We will either see a pump on 4 occasions, Monday on the T+35, the next PR drop, in < 3 weeks as we run up for the 6/9 conference or on 6/7-6/8 when our ever increasing ($1.9/day) floor overtakes our ~190ish resistance.

Well rocket up to like 280 and pause, probably for the rest of the day. Then WSB will fomo in and well see 450.

This is when the squeeze is on the launching pad. Almost anything below 450 is just retail buying up and naturally raising the price. Then margin calls go out and shorts have 5 days to cover. We'll see a few bursts of buying followed by a highly volatile 5 days. My opinions is that a the real squeeze will only start near the end of that 5 day timeframe when we move into forced liquidation territory.

one very frustrating thing I find about options trading is the lack of charting capability \*cough\* robinhood \*cough\*, or lack of ease of charting capability, ex, you have to hack the pentagon to view a contract in ToS.

So, I did something! I made u/diamondhandsbot to help redditors visualize their FDs and LEAPs. The format is simple, just feed the bot your contract, and it will spit a link to a website for charting the contract, example at the bottom.

Mods: yes, i made the website too. No, I don't make any money from the website, in fact, I'm paying money to keep the site up. Yes, I purchased the data legally.

use the bot like this:

    !diamondhandsbot SPY 5/28 $420 C

don't put anything else in your post, just the call to the bot, and then TICKER, EXP, STRIKE, C or P. The date will assume current year if you just put in month and day. If you want to look at leaps, just add the year like: 

    !diamondhandsbot SPY 1/21/22 $420 P

make sure you put the dollar sign before the strike! If you're looking up something with a half dollar strike increment just do one decimal, ex, $400.5

Use responsibly.",ni640g,"diamondhandsbot, a tool for apes"

OTM is also the place where savings can be destroyed.

Granted, I don't think that far out of the money is realistic for UWMC by September, but it's a higher torque bet, with a lambo payoff.  But, I could be wrong and have left lambo money on the table.

one very frustrating thing I find about options trading is the lack of charting capability \*cough\* robinhood \*cough\*, or lack of ease of charting capability, ex, you have to hack the pentagon to view a contract in ToS.

So, I did something! I made u/diamondhandsbot to help redditors visualize their FDs and LEAPs. The format is simple, just feed the bot your contract, and it will spit a link to a website for charting the contract, example at the bottom.

use the bot like this:

    !diamondhandsbot SPY 5/28 $420 C

don't put anything else in your post, just the call to the bot, and then TICKER, EXP, STRIKE, C or P. The date will assume current year if you just put in month and day. If you want to look at leaps, just add the year like: 

    !diamondhandsbot SPY 1/21/22 $420 P

make sure you put the dollar sign before the strike! If you're looking up something with a half dollar strike increment just do one decimal, ex, $400.5

Use responsibly.",ni6dxk,"diamondhandsbot, yay mean?"

This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let’s go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don’t need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there’s a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

Overall, I’m bullish and have over 30 call contracts expiring this July 🚀🚀🚀",nhdnzi,Bull Cruise $CCL primed to explode 🚀🚀📈🚀

There is little difference in their lines of business at the moment, margins are similar, products are similar. There’s very little differentiation, he’ll they’re in the same city. UWMC has had a better post-earnings period not because their top line YOY growth was so good or even indicative of something remotely possible to sustain moving forward, but really just because of the dividend and chest pounding against RKT.

I have a position in both, and before either camp starts screaming about how one is more revolutionary, or has better blah blah blah, realize that the only thing driving price action for either is public sentiment. UWMC declared a regular dividend while RKT only a special. 

Next week, either Jay Farner gets flashy (new dividend, massive auto rollout, something new) and starts publicly pushing back against Ishbia, or RKT continues downward. I think it’s 50/50 but looks ripe for anyone looking for a straddle yolo, with IV not as bad as it was before.

It might be to their advantage to do so because they are able to profit off of the availability of COMEX -- but at what price?  
In other words, saving COMEX yet again may be becoming just too *expensive* for JPM's bean counters/risk managers.  
Or maybe they simply don't have the available unencumbered silver to do this with any longer.  
JPM and their billion ounce mountain of silver may be a paper tiger. 

&#x200B;

Lets dign in !

**Comex silver warehouse .... another 1,000,000 oz is OUT OF THE VAULT, 43,000,000 oz is gone since the silverbacks arrived. This time it is all HSBC bank. And what did big powerful JP Morgan do? Nothing!! Maybe all their silver eligible is spoken for.** 

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418.
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

Now in 11-12 I was a security guard for a company that made coins for the us mint/ tiff jewelry.  Gold was crazy 16-1700$ an once.  It’s gone up 150-200$ an oz in the decade where we printed more money than we have since our founding. 

What if the government knew they were fucked and told hedge funds to naked short everything till oblivion. 


Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there’s at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don’t have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.

That’s some serious van de Graf generation going on, let alone arc insulation. 

They need to pick up orders of magnitude voltage enhancement to get anywhere near where any of these effects could possibly happen. 

As for competing tech. The worlds most intense laser fields are only now just attempting to reach >10^18 J/cm^2 in intensity and only on femtosecond timescales. 

If there’s anything that can reach these power levels it’s got to involve manipulation of inner shell atomic fields. Unlikely and hard to do in a macroscopic fashion without fields cancelling out between individual atoms. 

Otherwise there needs to be some magic trick that is not listed in the patent. Some kind of coherence previously undiscovered that enables high EM field generation at least locally within materials. 

All very dubious.

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.",,

It might be to their advantage to do so because they are able to profit off of the availability of COMEX -- but at what price?  
In other words, saving COMEX yet again may be becoming just too *expensive* for JPM's bean counters/risk managers.  
Or maybe they simply don't have the available unencumbered silver to do this with any longer.  
JPM and their billion ounce mountain of silver may be a paper tiger. 

&#x200B;

Lets dign in !

**Comex silver warehouse .... another 1,000,000 oz is OUT OF THE VAULT, 43,000,000 oz is gone since the silverbacks arrived. This time it is all HSBC bank. And what did big powerful JP Morgan do? Nothing!! Maybe all their silver eligible is spoken for.** 

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

The long story can be read in the links below.

I spoke to a sales rep at Tesla she says they haven't delivered any Model X or S this year and she doesn't think they will.

W-shape with today's price action.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418.
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

Now in 11-12 I was a security guard for a company that made coins for the us mint/ tiff jewelry.  Gold was crazy 16-1700$ an once.  It’s gone up 150-200$ an oz in the decade where we printed more money than we have since our founding. 

What if the government knew they were fucked and told hedge funds to naked short everything till oblivion. 


Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there’s at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don’t have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.  

Apes look up academic papers from the 08 collapse and what’s going on now naked shorting is on the rise.  

It’s nuts

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

Inflation is gonna destroy non-asset holders. I’m a bit worried about discount retail (5 below, DG, Dollar Tree) holding up because the business models are predicated on selling commodities at a certain price point. If commodity prices skyrocket dollar tree especially is gonna have a tough time adjusting since literally everything in their store is a dollar. So I think the better bet is to buy the actual companies that create goods that the poor are capable of buying (since inflation will eradicate much of the middle class.) Vizio products would never be sold in one of these stores but they sell really cheap TVs with internet accessibility. They sell a really good product considering the price point. I check their books and it’s a profitable company that’s been improving margins that last two years. Pretty low market cap so I wouldn’t be shocked if a larger company sought to buy it in the future.

3788,,2021-05-21 07:40:32,t3_nhmv7n,,wallstreetbets,"Ford is great value investment considering it will compete with TESLA for EV market - Most of bear case is ford debt and they are 100% wrong. Please read below article.

**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    
**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford’s finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford’s automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford’s $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford’s $160 billion debt load.

From old post:

1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

3790,,2021-05-21 09:36:45,t3_nhoi3w,,wallstreetbets,"Virgin Galactic announced they have a test flight scheduled for tomorrow and the stock moved up by 14% yesterday. I’m overall bearish on this company, as founder Richard Branson and SPAC-backer Chamath Palihapitiya have both sold basically all of their shares. Cathie Woods doesn’t even own it for ARK. 

I want to buy puts in anticipation of a drop Monday, this seems like the most likely outcome to me. Whether the launch is a failure or people just sell the news after a big move, it seems unlikely that it continues to rally Monday. There’s a lot of bag holders who bought at $40-60 a couple months ago that would love to get out if it bounces which would theoretically limit its possible gains Monday. On the chance the test flight greatly exceeds expectations or there is another announcement included along side the test, the stock could fly however. I feel that this is a slim but non-zero possibility. Basically whichever way it moves, it’s going to move hard. June 4th options have an IV of 165% per thinkorswim. 

My question is whether I am better off buying straight puts on $SPCE or if I should buy some sort of call/put spread to hedge my downside in the event the stock continues to fly Monday. My main concern is making the right move and still getting IV crushed. I’m looking at 6/4/21 $20 puts, or a spread at the same strike and expiry. In your opinions, is that a smart move or is there something else I should be considering? I’m still relatively new to trading options. 

Thanks for your input!

ReefShark is on track to reach 70% of 5G sales by year’s end. ReefShark is Nokia’s most recent semiconductor that powers its 5G base stations.

The ReefShark chipset is smaller, decreasing the antenna size by half, which makes these base stations less bulky and obtrusive.

3794,,2021-05-21 11:44:07,t3_nhqhhk,,wallstreetbets,"Explosive fires have started everywhere already. Stock markets are on fire and so are property markets, as well as bond and debt markets. The problem is that fires are initially explosive but always end up implosive. 

How predictable events are (and people). This is particularly true in the world economy. Empires come and go, economies boom and bust and new currencies come and without fail always go. All this happens with regularity. 

&#x200B;

 Everything really on fire :

 We have seen  about inflation running wild and it is not just happening in stocks. Property markets are literarily exploding, especially the high end. We see this all over the world and not just in the US. In the UK for example, HSBC stated that March saw the highest number of mortgages EVER issued. In Sweden properties sell for up to 40% above asking price in a frenzied bidding war and second hand leisure boats are in such demand that they cost virtually the same as a new boat. And if you want a new boat, there is none available until 2022. It also seems that people are desperate for company after the lockdowns as prices for puppies in the UK are up to 100% higher than last year.

 Yes, everything is really on fire as people are desperate to just spend, spend, spend after a year of lockdowns and restrictions. 

 AN ECONOMIC BUBBLE OF AIR

 Since air is free, governments can produce unlimited amounts of it. And without exception, gullible people want to believe that it is actually real money and not just empty air. The beauty for the government is that they can just produce and borrow trillions of dollars at ZERO cost. And by manipulating interest rates they can borrow this money also at virtually ZERO cost. 

 So first the government manufactures the money at no cost and then they pay NOTHING for the privilege of borrowing that money. 

 The money obviously creates massive bubbles in stocks, bonds, houses, used cars , boats, puppies and other massively overvalued investments and consumer items. 

 Just look at how, for example, the Dow has gone up **exponentially and parabolically** **in the last year in an historically unprecedented straight line.** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lnjdj8xvlg071.png?width=461&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a5b514632f262f311d158e14416251b98f6d00e

 

**US Federal Debt up 74X**  
**Total US debt up “only” 49X**  
**M2 Money Supply up 29X>**

**Debt to GDP 1971: 37% – 2021: 127%**

 Bubbles are called bubbles because they consist of air. And when bubbles become too big, they ALWAYS and without fail burst and implode. 

 Technically markets are giving very clear signals that THE END IS NIGH.

Whether that means days weeks or a few months, is totally irrelevant. We know that we are at the end of the most remarkable period in history in regards to money, investments and the economy.

 GOLD, SILVER AND WEALTH PRESERVATION

Gold  and Silver  have not at all reflected the massive creation of money in the last 50 years. That catchup phase is likely to start very soon based on both fundamentals and technicals. 

As regards securing your finances in periods of crisis, gold and silver have always been critical to hold.

 Everyone can afford some gold or silver. An ounce of silver is $28 and one gramme of gold is $50. So saving in precious metals will not only be very useful but essential at whatever level you can afford.

 The upside potential for gold and silver is multiples of the current prices and that is at today’s price levels. Higher inflation could take the metals to unfathomable heights.

Consequently, there was always a sequential decline in the number of subscribers in Q1 and Q2 in 2019 and 2020. Typically between -8 and -9% sequentially. Given the amazing performance that was achieved in Q3 and Q4 last year, it was heavily expected that this Q1 would again see a decline in paid subscribers.

And then the results were published. For the first time in its history, Fubo delivered a sequential growth in paid subscribers and revenue in a Q1! The inflection point as been passed, the business momentum is stronger than the seasonality of sports. Looking ahead, with the Olympics, the soccer world cup qualifiers, the main leagues restarting everywhere, I expect massive growth in paid subscribers.

Now, onto the revenue side. The ARPU is approximately constant at around 69$/month since Q3 2020. The low seasonality of Q1 means that the relative share of ARPU due to the advertising is quite low compared to Q3 and Q4 last year. Which means that a great improvement of the subscription ARPU has been reached in Q1!

Now, when we'll go into Q3 and then Q4, with the absurd growth in number of subscribers and the massive gains from advertising, I'm expecting the ARPU to again grow. Expected advertising growth is 100% YOY.

And what happens when you combine massive subscribers and ARPU growth? You have massive results.

The cherries on the cake are:

1. Fubo betting which comes as a free version in Q3 and then paid version in Q4. It can be massive as Fubo will be the only player in the industry to control end to end the viewer/bettor experience.
2. International expansion, in Europe first probably, starting in 2022.

They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.

Should you trust me? Am I financial advisor – good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips. Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago? We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can’t lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist? What the fuck does that mean – fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill. Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn’t just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine – kind of a big deal. They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year. Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe – think FDA is going to delay?

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no. They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted. Added bonus – Pfizer’s big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also – or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain’t going cheap. They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner. Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn’t allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth. The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes – former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – not piece of shit pharma we have here. Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks. You don’t have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear. No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential? Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities – hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men’s lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself. Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant’s drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued. MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down - whatever could they do with that cash? $44 a share wouldn’t even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down. With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in – remember this isn’t some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them. And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can’t see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone. FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they’ve already approved in new indications like this one. Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point. It’s down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason. FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density – the solution: they will monitor bone density. That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on – doesn’t that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer. Even if they don’t Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs.

It was Congressionally mandated in the last stimulus bill and gave the government 180 days to release an unclassified report to the general public and a classified report to congress. We are approaching that time, and June/July could be a heavy shift in perspectives and R&D priorities. [Sen.

These UAP’s exhibit unexplainable flight characteristics: near instantaneous acceleration, airplane/submersible hybrid characteristics, visual disappearance, odd acoustics, etc. Also, multiple “types” of craft have been observed. 

There are patents filed by the Navy for inertial mass reduction craft (basically creating a quantum vacuum around the craft to avoid air/water resistance; useful to go Mach 16+ in the atmosphere). Here’s the patent: [Triangular UAP Patent?](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10144532B2/en). Additionally, we have heard rumors (and they may just be rumors) of anti-gravity temporal displacement craft. These craft can accelerate by utilizing gravity waves, bend light through a gravity well (stealthy), and externally perceived time could be affected as well (think Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar) ([Gravity Wave Patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10322827B2/) ) This UAP sightings might be manned craft or something else, or a mixture of both. These patents could also be counter-espionage missions to throw foreign countries off true technological breakthroughs, but we do know there was a demo of the tech: [Navy acknowledging demo, but not production ready](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/37134/emails-show-navys-ufo-patents-went-through-significant-internal-review-resulted-in-a-demo)

Okay great, so what’s the play…

**Long-Raytheon ($RTX)** has the Advanced Targeting Forward Look Infrared Sensor, which can be utilized to track UAP’s. This technology has been out for over a decade. Additionally, Raytheon is the go-to company for research into lasers, targeted radiation, or proton beams (still no word on proton torpedoes). ([UFO Targeting Pod](https://sofrep.com/news/following-pentagon-admission-raytheon-touts-gear-ufo-spotter/))

**Long-Lockheed Martin ($LMT)** a major defense aerospace firm, which developed many prototypes over the years and is famous for the Skunkworks R&D lab. Former Senator Harry Reid believes Lockheed has UAP fragments in their possession ([UAP Fragments](https://deadline.com/2021/04/ufo-fragments-in-possession-lockheed-martin-says-harry-reid-1234748095/)). These fragments are believed to be made of an unknown metal/alloy, and potentially 3D printed at an atomic level.

**Long-Northrup Grumman ($NOC)** is a defense giant which developed the B-2 stealth bomber and is a contractor on multiple space infrastructure missions. They would be vital for advanced composites/metallurgy, advanced avionics, spaceflight, and tracking systems.

Additionally, we have no clear knowledge of where the Chinese and Russians are at with this technology. Maybe this is partly why we founded Space Force?

Can't believe I'm gonna throw shade on a firm I used to love but they have REALLY gone down hill.  Don't feel like writing a wall of text but want to warn others who are thinking of switching into them so I'm just going to bullet point problems I've had.  If you are with them already and feel so-so about them... there are better options out there.  Moving money is a pain in the ass but it might be worth it.

**Issues I've had with them**

* Margin approval is like pulling teeth.  They want to grill you to death for like half an hour and slowly increase your options approval one step at a time (honestly some of those guys seem like idiots and I'm not sure how they got their certifications).  If they don't like exactly how you answer questions even as an experienced trader that's been doing it for a while, they will delay your application by up to 6 months before you can try again.  That hasn't happened to me fortunately but apparently they do that so I'm always very anxious talking to them.  I have $600k ish with them in all my accounts and my risk per trade is typically capped at $50-60k.  I tend to have extra cash if I need to average down or add something to hedge my position.  Never used margin even though I have it since it's required to do a lot of different trades.

* Frequent outages (especially at market open), error messages, slow to load in the browser portal.  Desktop platform ""StreetSmart"" is terrible IMO but I suppose that is a matter of taste.  They're portal option trading is otherwise aright, I've seen better and worse but nothing to write home about.

* $1k recently mysteriously disappeared in my account.  They were quick to correct it and apparently it's some ""very rare"" programming error but who the fuck knows for sure.  I'm sure a lot of retards out there don't even notice if money is ever missing.

* Finally, something that has always bothered me is that their execution doesn't seem that good.  With options especially +/- a couple pennies (or nickel for larger contracts) can actually make a huge difference on your P&L for a trade.  They are THE LEADER in PFOF revenue.  Fuck them.

3823,,2021-05-21 17:50:01,t3_nhyj2a,,wallstreetbets," **Before I talk Technical Analysis (TA), it is important to understand the following:**

Technical Analysis is absolute meaningless astrology unless the strategies and indicators used are statistically/quantitatively *proven to be meaningful*. There are a lot of articles being published (and even shared here) about TLRY's TA - ignore them. They have zero weight on Tilray's future. Most of these chart patterns, strategies, theories, ideas, etc. taught in traditional trading education come from early 1900's anecdotal theories, which were nothing more than early, primitive attempts to identify patterns in markets. But, this is a story and an explanation for another time.

**In-Depth MACD Explanation:**

Since it's a popular retail indicator, most of you probably already know what the Moving Average Converence/Divergence (MACD) is. However, it's usually not well understood. The MACD takes in three settings for Moving Averages (MA) and the two lines plotted on the indicator are calculated as so:

MACD Line: Short MA - Long MA

Signal Line: Signal MA of the MACD Line

This is actually an incredibly clever way of measuring momentum and trend-following. By taking the difference between two different MA periods, we get a second-derivative (i.e. acceleration). By default, the MACD is calculated an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and with period settings (12, 26, 9).

**So, onto TLRY's** ***potential*** **momentum shift:**

*Note that I said ""potential,"" because the land of quantitative/algorithmic trading is nothing more than a probability game developed through hypothesis testing.*

Today, TLRY experienced a MACD crossover with MACD settings (SMA, 28, 48, 32). Why these settings? Because I ran a statistical backtest on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and simulated over 140,000 settings in an attempt to find the best practical combination to signal price change over the next few days via MACD crossover (Fun fact: using a Simple Moving Average (SMA) *always* yields better results, no matter what symbol or asset class).

If I were to buy ever MACD (SMA, 28, 48, 32) crossover at the daily closing price and hold for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days, what would my results be? Here's the results for the SPY since 2003:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k8lmq168hi071.png?width=1885&format=png&auto=webp&s=1af5f7ce7e179b59a18a198aaab1447e6177afc8

Positive mean returns and a high win frequency are significant, with the 1st day after buying being the most important. So, now that we've seen it's general significance in large-cap, what are the backtested results for TLRY? Well, it's tough because Tilray hasn't had a publicly traded stock for very long, so the sample size is insufficiently small. But, take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/6d1lvnx9hi071.png?width=1932&format=png&auto=webp&s=24595178d1e6e808074bd46a7e8ad6a8442b3e98

It still holds some significance with the positive means and win frequencies. But obviously with only 9 crossovers happening in TLRY's lifetime, we can't take these numbers and fit them to any model.

**So, using the most statistically effective MACD period settings, TLRY** ***may*** **be getting a shift in momentum here fairly soon!**

I understand that my initial claims for the (28, 48, 32) settings were only tested on the SPY, and Tilray isn't large-cap growth. There is still more testing and solidifying to do. BUT, I figured you apes who are still holding are continually waiting for a confirmation bias, so here you go :)",nhyj2a,Tilray (TLRY) MACD Momentum Shift - Quantitative TA

You probably havent heard about [The Lion Electric Company](https://thelionelectric.com/). Its because its only been 2 weeks since they are officially listed on both [NYSE](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy5d2/nyselev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [TSX](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy67g/tsxlev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). Before that, you could only buy the SPAC's stock Northern Genesis Acquisition. This is when I first bought most of my shares.

Basic infos about the stock:
- currently worth 19 U$D (+30% this week and its the highest ever with ticker LEV)
- Market Cap 3,5 billion USD


What does the Lion do? They do 100% electric trucks and busses.
And yes there is a lot of competition in the EV market, but not that much for trucks. Lion doesnt make cars, only trucks. They also already have orders from Amazon and scholar institution. 


What makes me think LEV is a buy



1. Lion is going to open a manufacturing facility in Illinois worth about $500M. The Illinois government is financing $70M for this. When full operational, the factory will be able to produce 20,000 vehicles per year. It will be the biggest of its kind in the US. Lion says they plan they start production in mid-2022. 



2. Lion is also opening a battery factory in Quebec (Canada). The government is financing 100M CAD (roughly 82M USD) to help them build it. This means that not only Lion will make 100% electric trucks, they will also produce their own batteries which they could potentially sell to other businesses in the future. But most important is that they wont have to buy it from another. 



3. Canada will no longer allow to sell new gasoline vehicles by 2035 (it doesnt concern used cars). This is in 15 years (only? Lol). But a lot of companies already started their transition to 100% EV. And all the state owned business will buy from a Canadian company, because thats how Canada works most of the time. All the school busses and normal busses have to be replaced, and we know they wont buy from a Chinese company when there is a Canadian one available. So its probably going to be Lion Electric. You should also note that some private companies like Loblaws are already transitioning to EV, they bought a lot of Tesla trucks recently. However, Lion's trucks are not only Canadian but also expected to be cheaper and good quality. 



4. Lion has clients
Amazon made a contract with Lion to buy 2,500 trucks over 5 years. But theres a downside: Lion is obliged to reserve 500 trucks per year for Amazon, while Amazon isnt obliged to actually buy them. It means that if the trucks quality is deceiptive, its possible Amazon would not buy them. This would of course be horrible for the stock.
But Amazon isnt the only big client: First Student bought 260 busses from Lion. It was announced this week, and I can still feel the +30% impact on my portfolio. Everyday LEV went higher than the previous one. 



5. LEV has a huge potential for long term profit. I personally think the stock could reach 25USD before the end of the year, but it could be even more. And when the Illinois facility will finally open, the stock should go higher than 30. If you look up the Northern Genesis stock history (the SPAC that merged with Lion 3 weeks ago), you will see the stock was at 30+ in January, but it fell with all the EV market. If you dont buy LEV this year, it might be too late. Of course the stock will be way higher in 5 years than now, but the more profit the better, right?



So in my opinion, you will make 100% to 300% within 3-4 years with this stock. But I am not an expert and you dont have to trust me. I trust myself and mostly trust The Lion Electric Company. I am already making small profit from this investment.


Have a good day and may your portfolio be green!",nhyn43,LEV: Lion Electric is the underdog

Now, there are two narratives if you are interested in buying SNDL stock. First is the bullish one that points to the ample cash on its balance sheet. SNDL is becoming like the Berkshire Hathaway of the marijuana industry. The company is investing and lending to several smaller marijuana companies. Also, it could expand into the U.S. adult-use market.


As for TLRY, it looks like a good marijuana company to buy from a business perspective. The company is a marijuana powerhouse with international operations and both medical and adult-use businesses. Also, count on the post-merger synergies and economies of scale to work for the new TLRY.



To sum it up, from a purely business perspective, you will bet on TLRY. However, if you are looking at betting on an investment vehicle that can capitalize on the troubles of some of the smaller marijuana companies, SNDL will fit the bill.",nhzt5b,"SNDL vs TLRY, comment your favorite"

# Company Overview

**LendingTree (NASDAQ: TREE)** is America’s largest online marketplace connecting lenders and borrowers. LendingTree empowers lenders to shop for financial services the same way one would shop for hotel stays or airline tickets- comparing multiple offers from a nationwide network of over 800 partners that offer their customers services such as mortgage loans, mortgage refinances, auto loans, personal loans, business loans, and much more.

   * Nikko Asset Management Americas Inc. raised holdings by 15.4% during 4Q
* Insider Transactions:
   * Independent Director G. Thompson purchase 1.4M worth of share at about $282/share
   * Suggests a positive outlook for the company as the price was bought above the price it was trading at then

# Industry Overview and Outlook

* Low-interest rates have fueled consumer demand for refinancing existing debt and access to new debt
* Industry consolidation is occurring due to shrinking margins and increased regulatory costs
   * Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act to encourage consumer lending
* Strong economy coupled with strong employment numbers have led to a surge in home sales
   * Pandemic-drriven demand sent total home sales to the highest since 2006
   * 5.6% increase YoY for homes sold

   * 5 of the largest mortgage lenders in the U.S are non-banks
* Projected $73.7B in loan origination for 2022
   * $35.6B from personal loans, $13.6B from small and medium entrepreneur loans, and $24.5B from refinancing student debt
   * Approx. 79.3% growth since loan origination value of $41.4B from 2017
* Pandemic-driven demand sent total home sales to the highest since 2006

# Investment Thesis I: Established Leader in the Marketplace

LendingTree’s competitive advantages in the marketplace differentiate them from other loan or insurance comparison-shopping marketplaces.

* **Speed:** easy-use; apply for loans in minutes and lock-in rates
* **Convenience:** search and apply for quotes 24/7 from anywhere in the world
* **Competitive Rates:** average buyer saves $125-$163 per month for interest
   * LendingTree has saved refinanced borrowers the most in San Francisco, San Diego and Los Angeles with median savings of $80,211, $77,740 and $73,954 respectively
   * Even in cities with  refinancing savings like Detroit present median savings of $23,409

# Investment Thesis II: Insurance Growth

* The insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and the number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Refer to chart ‘Segment Revenue’
   * Insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Expected revenue growth of 30% + compared to 2Q2020
* Acquisitions of QuoteWizard in 4Q2018 and ValuePenguin in 1Q2019 allowed them to enhance their insurance products 
   * QuoteWizard – one of the largest insurance comparison marketplaces in the growing online insurance advertising market
      * This acquisition established LendingTree as a leading player in the online insurance advertising industry while also allowing them to diversify their financial services category
      * Significant portion of their revenue growth in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was driven by their insurance leads business from this acquisition 
   * ValuePenguin – personal finance website that offers consumers objective analysis on variety of financial topics from insurance to credit cards
      * This acquisition provided immense value to insurance carriers and agents through their high-quality content and SEO capability – allowing them further scale in the insurance space
* New Medicare category for insurance growth showed significant promise during their first open-enrollment period in the 4Q2020
   * Presents a significant opportunity for their insurance segment 

# Major Risks 

**Consumer Demand Risk –** a general increase in interest rates may affect the ability of LendingTree’s mortgage Network Partners to close loans which will translate to lower revenues for LendingTree and ultimately affect their financial position

**Interest Rate Risk –** The Federal Reserve is currently printing out more money in order to keep the markets afloat due to COVID-19. In the long-term, this will cause inflation and the decreasing value of the USD. To combat this, the Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates

# Final Thoughts

The positive industry outlook and the prospective insurance segment of LendingTree that has generated high growth YoY strengthen analysts’ recommendations to BUY. Given a stock price forecast projecting a median price target of $320 (60.7% upside) and a low-price target of $200 (0.5% upside), I believe this stock still has a low of room for growth as they continue to diversify its revenue streams and expanding their financial services. Furthermore, I’ve provided a chart of analyst recommendations retrieved from CNN Business that strengthens the recommendation to BUY.

Large open interest & volume on the June 18 expiration date, any reason why there's x10 times the normal open interest on the options expiring June 18? over 15M shares to cover options in the money as of today

GOLD is a good value company, with over 12B in revenue in 2020 & market cap is only 3.5x last year's revenue. Over 2B/yr in earnings the last 2 years & 5B in cash. Most of the business is in Gold mining 20% is in copper. Commodity prices keep climbing higher, so it's a good hedge for inflation.

For full disclosure I own several calls at the $20, $22, $23  expiring in June-Sept as well as shares of GOLD for the long to medium term. I'm no financial advisor and I'm likely wrong.

The stock has been seeing some resistance at $25 lately, but if the price of gold per ounce ($1881 currently) crosses the $1890... June is going to be a very good month for Barrick Gold. It's a quality company in my opinion & the market is at a tipping point, so it's a good safety net (maybe...)

However I was deep thinking, so I started digging.  We never recovered from the 08 crisis.  They just dropped interest rates and turned on the printer.  

Now in 11-12 I was a security guard for a company that made coins for the us mint/ tiff jewelry.  Gold was crazy 16-1700$ an once.  It’s gone up 150-200$ an oz in the decade where we printed more money than we have since our founding. 

What if the government knew they were fucked and told hedge funds to naked short everything till oblivion. 


Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there’s at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don’t have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.  

Apes look up academic papers from the 08 collapse and what’s going on now naked shorting is on the rise.  

It’s nuts

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

TLDR; BIGC good, like SHOP, but undervalued.

Inflation is gonna destroy non-asset holders. I’m a bit worried about discount retail (5 below, DG, Dollar Tree) holding up because the business models are predicated on selling commodities at a certain price point. If commodity prices skyrocket dollar tree especially is gonna have a tough time adjusting since literally everything in their store is a dollar. So I think the better bet is to buy the actual companies that create goods that the poor are capable of buying (since inflation will eradicate much of the middle class.) Vizio products would never be sold in one of these stores but they sell really cheap TVs with internet accessibility. They sell a really good product considering the price point. I check their books and it’s a profitable company that’s been improving margins that last two years. Pretty low market cap so I wouldn’t be shocked if a larger company sought to buy it in the future.

4119,,2021-05-21 07:40:32,t3_nhmv7n,,wallstreetbets,"Ford is great value investment considering it will compete with TESLA for EV market - Most of bear case is ford debt and they are 100% wrong. Please read below article.

**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    
**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford’s finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford’s automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford’s $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford’s $160 billion debt load.

From old post:

1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

4121,,2021-05-21 09:36:45,t3_nhoi3w,,wallstreetbets,"Virgin Galactic announced they have a test flight scheduled for tomorrow and the stock moved up by 14% yesterday. I’m overall bearish on this company, as founder Richard Branson and SPAC-backer Chamath Palihapitiya have both sold basically all of their shares. Cathie Woods doesn’t even own it for ARK. 

I want to buy puts in anticipation of a drop Monday, this seems like the most likely outcome to me. Whether the launch is a failure or people just sell the news after a big move, it seems unlikely that it continues to rally Monday. There’s a lot of bag holders who bought at $40-60 a couple months ago that would love to get out if it bounces which would theoretically limit its possible gains Monday. On the chance the test flight greatly exceeds expectations or there is another announcement included along side the test, the stock could fly however. I feel that this is a slim but non-zero possibility. Basically whichever way it moves, it’s going to move hard. June 4th options have an IV of 165% per thinkorswim. 

My question is whether I am better off buying straight puts on $SPCE or if I should buy some sort of call/put spread to hedge my downside in the event the stock continues to fly Monday. My main concern is making the right move and still getting IV crushed. I’m looking at 6/4/21 $20 puts, or a spread at the same strike and expiry. In your opinions, is that a smart move or is there something else I should be considering? I’m still relatively new to trading options. 

Thanks for your input!

Huawei had won 91 global 5G contracts.

I suspect Nokia will have a favorable win rate as others try to compete with ReefShark. Nokia’s AI-enabled chip ReefShark which is used to power Nokia’s 5G base stations made up 44% of 5G sales. ReefShark is on track to reach 70% of 5G sales by year’s end. ReefShark is Nokia’s most recent semiconductor that powers its 5G base stations.

The ReefShark chipset is smaller, decreasing the antenna size by half, which makes these base stations less bulky and obtrusive. It helps enable a 50 – 60% reduction in energy use compared to previous chips. This lowers the total cost of ownership for wireless providers and it is a great selling point.",nhqc9p,Nokia succeeded in overtaking Huawei and Ericsson

How predictable events are (and people). This is particularly true in the world economy. Empires come and go, economies boom and bust and new currencies come and without fail always go. All this happens with regularity. 

&#x200B;

 Everything really on fire :

 We have seen  about inflation running wild and it is not just happening in stocks. Property markets are literarily exploding, especially the high end. We see this all over the world and not just in the US. In the UK for example, HSBC stated that March saw the highest number of mortgages EVER issued. In Sweden properties sell for up to 40% above asking price in a frenzied bidding war and second hand leisure boats are in such demand that they cost virtually the same as a new boat. And if you want a new boat, there is none available until 2022. It also seems that people are desperate for company after the lockdowns as prices for puppies in the UK are up to 100% higher than last year.

 Yes, everything is really on fire as people are desperate to just spend, spend, spend after a year of lockdowns and restrictions. 

 AN ECONOMIC BUBBLE OF AIR

 Since air is free, governments can produce unlimited amounts of it. And without exception, gullible people want to believe that it is actually real money and not just empty air. The beauty for the government is that they can just produce and borrow trillions of dollars at ZERO cost. And by manipulating interest rates they can borrow this money also at virtually ZERO cost. 

 So first the government manufactures the money at no cost and then they pay NOTHING for the privilege of borrowing that money. 

 The money obviously creates massive bubbles in stocks, bonds, houses, used cars , boats, puppies and other massively overvalued investments and consumer items. 

 Just look at how, for example, the Dow has gone up **exponentially and parabolically** **in the last year in an historically unprecedented straight line.**

**US Federal Debt up 74X**  
**Total US debt up “only” 49X**  
**M2 Money Supply up 29X>**

**Debt to GDP 1971: 37% – 2021: 127%**

 Bubbles are called bubbles because they consist of air. And when bubbles become too big, they ALWAYS and without fail burst and implode. 

 Technically markets are giving very clear signals that THE END IS NIGH.

Whether that means days weeks or a few months, is totally irrelevant. We know that we are at the end of the most remarkable period in history in regards to money, investments and the economy.

 GOLD, SILVER AND WEALTH PRESERVATION

Gold  and Silver  have not at all reflected the massive creation of money in the last 50 years. That catchup phase is likely to start very soon based on both fundamentals and technicals. 

As regards securing your finances in periods of crisis, gold and silver have always been critical to hold.

 Everyone can afford some gold or silver. An ounce of silver is $28 and one gramme of gold is $50. So saving in precious metals will not only be very useful but essential at whatever level you can afford.

 The upside potential for gold and silver is multiples of the current prices and that is at today’s price levels. Higher inflation could take the metals to unfathomable heights.

4127,,2021-05-21 12:45:14,t3_nhrmu8,,wallstreetbets,"FuboTV posted its Q1 results on the 11th. Seasonality in sports is obviously huge, with Q1 and Q2 being the worst periods of the season.

Consequently, there was always a sequential decline in the number of subscribers in Q1 and Q2 in 2019 and 2020. Typically between -8 and -9% sequentially. Given the amazing performance that was achieved in Q3 and Q4 last year, it was heavily expected that this Q1 would again see a decline in paid subscribers.

And then the results were published. For the first time in its history, Fubo delivered a sequential growth in paid subscribers and revenue in a Q1! The inflection point as been passed, the business momentum is stronger than the seasonality of sports. Looking ahead, with the Olympics, the soccer world cup qualifiers, the main leagues restarting everywhere, I expect massive growth in paid subscribers.

Now, onto the revenue side. The ARPU is approximately constant at around 69$/month since Q3 2020. The low seasonality of Q1 means that the relative share of ARPU due to the advertising is quite low compared to Q3 and Q4 last year. Which means that a great improvement of the subscription ARPU has been reached in Q1!

Now, when we'll go into Q3 and then Q4, with the absurd growth in number of subscribers and the massive gains from advertising, I'm expecting the ARPU to again grow. Expected advertising growth is 100% YOY.

And what happens when you combine massive subscribers and ARPU growth? You have massive results.

The cherries on the cake are:

1. Fubo betting which comes as a free version in Q3 and then paid version in Q4. It can be massive as Fubo will be the only player in the industry to control end to end the viewer/bettor experience.
2. International expansion, in Europe first probably, starting in 2022.
3. Accepting wagering in unconventional currencies.

I am not here to say the next crash will occur this October or on any other date (I well know that correlation is not causation). I have no subtle purpose to share, it's just for the curiosity of this pattern.

p.s. Probably the cause is because October is my birthday.

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes – well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you’ll double your money. This isn’t some wishy washy bullshit oh it’s going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it’s just a question of when. How can I be so sure? They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.

Should you trust me? Am I financial advisor – good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips. Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago? We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can’t lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist? What the fuck does that mean – fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill. Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn’t just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine – kind of a big deal. They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year. Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe – think FDA is going to delay?

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no. They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted. Added bonus – Pfizer’s big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also – or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain’t going cheap. They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner. Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn’t allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth. The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes – former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – not piece of shit pharma we have here. Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks. You don’t have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear. No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential? Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities – hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men’s lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself. Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant’s drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued. MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down - whatever could they do with that cash? $44 a share wouldn’t even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down. With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in – remember this isn’t some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them. And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can’t see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone. FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they’ve already approved in new indications like this one. Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point. It’s down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason. FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density – the solution: they will monitor bone density. That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on – doesn’t that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer. Even if they don’t Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs. Truly can’t fucking lose. so why is it trading so cheap?

It was Congressionally mandated in the last stimulus bill and gave the government 180 days to release an unclassified report to the general public and a classified report to congress. We are approaching that time, and June/July could be a heavy shift in perspectives and R&D priorities. [Sen. Rubio's Comments](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ufo-reports-should-be-taken-seriously-rubio-says-11621245038) [WaPo Article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/03/23/ufo-report-covid-bill/)

These UAP’s exhibit unexplainable flight characteristics: near instantaneous acceleration, airplane/submersible hybrid characteristics, visual disappearance, odd acoustics, etc. Also, multiple “types” of craft have been observed. 

There are patents filed by the Navy for inertial mass reduction craft (basically creating a quantum vacuum around the craft to avoid air/water resistance; useful to go Mach 16+ in the atmosphere). Here’s the patent: [Triangular UAP Patent?](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10144532B2/en). Additionally, we have heard rumors (and they may just be rumors) of anti-gravity temporal displacement craft. These craft can accelerate by utilizing gravity waves, bend light through a gravity well (stealthy), and externally perceived time could be affected as well (think Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar) ([Gravity Wave Patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10322827B2/) ) This UAP sightings might be manned craft or something else, or a mixture of both. These patents could also be counter-espionage missions to throw foreign countries off true technological breakthroughs, but we do know there was a demo of the tech: [Navy acknowledging demo, but not production ready](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/37134/emails-show-navys-ufo-patents-went-through-significant-internal-review-resulted-in-a-demo)

Okay great, so what’s the play…

**Long-Raytheon ($RTX)** has the Advanced Targeting Forward Look Infrared Sensor, which can be utilized to track UAP’s. This technology has been out for over a decade. Additionally, Raytheon is the go-to company for research into lasers, targeted radiation, or proton beams (still no word on proton torpedoes). ([UFO Targeting Pod](https://sofrep.com/news/following-pentagon-admission-raytheon-touts-gear-ufo-spotter/))

**Long-Lockheed Martin ($LMT)** a major defense aerospace firm, which developed many prototypes over the years and is famous for the Skunkworks R&D lab. Former Senator Harry Reid believes Lockheed has UAP fragments in their possession ([UAP Fragments](https://deadline.com/2021/04/ufo-fragments-in-possession-lockheed-martin-says-harry-reid-1234748095/)). These fragments are believed to be made of an unknown metal/alloy, and potentially 3D printed at an atomic level.

**Long-Northrup Grumman ($NOC)** is a defense giant which developed the B-2 stealth bomber and is a contractor on multiple space infrastructure missions. They would be vital for advanced composites/metallurgy, advanced avionics, spaceflight, and tracking systems.

Additionally, we have no clear knowledge of where the Chinese and Russians are at with this technology. Maybe this is partly why we founded Space Force? This is a \~2 month play to see if we can get more decisive acknowledgement of the technology whether it is manned or alien, either way it could make for an interesting news summer.",nht2ep,The Alien Trade

Can't believe I'm gonna throw shade on a firm I used to love but they have REALLY gone down hill.  Don't feel like writing a wall of text but want to warn others who are thinking of switching into them so I'm just going to bullet point problems I've had.  If you are with them already and feel so-so about them... there are better options out there.  Moving money is a pain in the ass but it might be worth it.

**Issues I've had with them**

* Margin approval is like pulling teeth.  They want to grill you to death for like half an hour and slowly increase your options approval one step at a time (honestly some of those guys seem like idiots and I'm not sure how they got their certifications).  If they don't like exactly how you answer questions even as an experienced trader that's been doing it for a while, they will delay your application by up to 6 months before you can try again.  That hasn't happened to me fortunately but apparently they do that so I'm always very anxious talking to them.  I have $600k ish with them in all my accounts and my risk per trade is typically capped at $50-60k.  I tend to have extra cash if I need to average down or add something to hedge my position.  Never used margin even though I have it since it's required to do a lot of different trades.

* Frequent outages (especially at market open), error messages, slow to load in the browser portal.  Desktop platform ""StreetSmart"" is terrible IMO but I suppose that is a matter of taste.  They're portal option trading is otherwise aright, I've seen better and worse but nothing to write home about.

* $1k recently mysteriously disappeared in my account.  They were quick to correct it and apparently it's some ""very rare"" programming error but who the fuck knows for sure.  I'm sure a lot of retards out there don't even notice if money is ever missing.

* Finally, something that has always bothered me is that their execution doesn't seem that good.  With options especially +/- a couple pennies (or nickel for larger contracts) can actually make a huge difference on your P&L for a trade.  They are THE LEADER in PFOF revenue.  Fuck them.


When I joined them close to 20 years ago, I worshiped Charles Schwab.  You can google him but he was Good Guy broker when no one cared about retail back in the day.

3. Unsuccessful test flight

4154,,2021-05-21 17:50:01,t3_nhyj2a,,wallstreetbets," **Before I talk Technical Analysis (TA), it is important to understand the following:**

Technical Analysis is absolute meaningless astrology unless the strategies and indicators used are statistically/quantitatively *proven to be meaningful*. There are a lot of articles being published (and even shared here) about TLRY's TA - ignore them. They have zero weight on Tilray's future. Most of these chart patterns, strategies, theories, ideas, etc. taught in traditional trading education come from early 1900's anecdotal theories, which were nothing more than early, primitive attempts to identify patterns in markets. But, this is a story and an explanation for another time.

**In-Depth MACD Explanation:**

Since it's a popular retail indicator, most of you probably already know what the Moving Average Converence/Divergence (MACD) is. However, it's usually not well understood. The MACD takes in three settings for Moving Averages (MA) and the two lines plotted on the indicator are calculated as so:

MACD Line: Short MA - Long MA

Signal Line: Signal MA of the MACD Line

This is actually an incredibly clever way of measuring momentum and trend-following. By taking the difference between two different MA periods, we get a second-derivative (i.e. acceleration). By default, the MACD is calculated an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and with period settings (12, 26, 9).

**So, onto TLRY's** ***potential*** **momentum shift:**

*Note that I said ""potential,"" because the land of quantitative/algorithmic trading is nothing more than a probability game developed through hypothesis testing.*

Today, TLRY experienced a MACD crossover with MACD settings (SMA, 28, 48, 32). Why these settings? Because I ran a statistical backtest on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and simulated over 140,000 settings in an attempt to find the best practical combination to signal price change over the next few days via MACD crossover (Fun fact: using a Simple Moving Average (SMA) *always* yields better results, no matter what symbol or asset class).

If I were to buy ever MACD (SMA, 28, 48, 32) crossover at the daily closing price and hold for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days, what would my results be? Here's the results for the SPY since 2003:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k8lmq168hi071.png?width=1885&format=png&auto=webp&s=1af5f7ce7e179b59a18a198aaab1447e6177afc8

Positive mean returns and a high win frequency are significant, with the 1st day after buying being the most important. So, now that we've seen it's general significance in large-cap, what are the backtested results for TLRY? Well, it's tough because Tilray hasn't had a publicly traded stock for very long, so the sample size is insufficiently small. But, take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/6d1lvnx9hi071.png?width=1932&format=png&auto=webp&s=24595178d1e6e808074bd46a7e8ad6a8442b3e98

It still holds some significance with the positive means and win frequencies. But obviously with only 9 crossovers happening in TLRY's lifetime, we can't take these numbers and fit them to any model.

**So, using the most statistically effective MACD period settings, TLRY** ***may*** **be getting a shift in momentum here fairly soon!**

I understand that my initial claims for the (28, 48, 32) settings were only tested on the SPY, and Tilray isn't large-cap growth. There is still more testing and solidifying to do. BUT, I figured you apes who are still holding are continually waiting for a confirmation bias, so here you go :)",nhyj2a,Tilray (TLRY) MACD Momentum Shift - Quantitative TA

Edit: nice close at 19$

You probably havent heard about [The Lion Electric Company](https://thelionelectric.com/). Its because its only been 2 weeks since they are officially listed on both [NYSE](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy5d2/nyselev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [TSX](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy67g/tsxlev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). Before that, you could only buy the SPAC's stock Northern Genesis Acquisition. This is when I first bought most of my shares.

Basic infos about the stock:
- currently worth 19 U$D (+30% this week and its the highest ever with ticker LEV)
- Market Cap 3,5 billion USD


What does the Lion do? They do 100% electric trucks and busses.
And yes there is a lot of competition in the EV market, but not that much for trucks. Lion doesnt make cars, only trucks. They also already have orders from Amazon and scholar institution. 


What makes me think LEV is a buy



1. Lion is going to open a manufacturing facility in Illinois worth about $500M. The Illinois government is financing $70M for this. When full operational, the factory will be able to produce 20,000 vehicles per year. It will be the biggest of its kind in the US. Lion says they plan they start production in mid-2022. 



2. Lion is also opening a battery factory in Quebec (Canada). The government is financing 100M CAD (roughly 82M USD) to help them build it. This means that not only Lion will make 100% electric trucks, they will also produce their own batteries which they could potentially sell to other businesses in the future. But most important is that they wont have to buy it from another. 



3. Canada will no longer allow to sell new gasoline vehicles by 2035 (it doesnt concern used cars). This is in 15 years (only? Lol). But a lot of companies already started their transition to 100% EV. And all the state owned business will buy from a Canadian company, because thats how Canada works most of the time. All the school busses and normal busses have to be replaced, and we know they wont buy from a Chinese company when there is a Canadian one available. So its probably going to be Lion Electric. You should also note that some private companies like Loblaws are already transitioning to EV, they bought a lot of Tesla trucks recently. However, Lion's trucks are not only Canadian but also expected to be cheaper and good quality. 



4. Lion has clients
Amazon made a contract with Lion to buy 2,500 trucks over 5 years. But theres a downside: Lion is obliged to reserve 500 trucks per year for Amazon, while Amazon isnt obliged to actually buy them. It means that if the trucks quality is deceiptive, its possible Amazon would not buy them. This would of course be horrible for the stock.
But Amazon isnt the only big client: First Student bought 260 busses from Lion. It was announced this week, and I can still feel the +30% impact on my portfolio. Everyday LEV went higher than the previous one. 



5. LEV has a huge potential for long term profit. I personally think the stock could reach 25USD before the end of the year, but it could be even more. And when the Illinois facility will finally open, the stock should go higher than 30. If you look up the Northern Genesis stock history (the SPAC that merged with Lion 3 weeks ago), you will see the stock was at 30+ in January, but it fell with all the EV market. If you dont buy LEV this year, it might be too late. Of course the stock will be way higher in 5 years than now, but the more profit the better, right?



So in my opinion, you will make 100% to 300% within 3-4 years with this stock. But I am not an expert and you dont have to trust me. I trust myself and mostly trust The Lion Electric Company. I am already making small profit from this investment.


Have a good day and may your portfolio be green!",nhyn43,LEV: Lion Electric is the underdog

SNDL is becoming like the Berkshire Hathaway of the marijuana industry. The company is investing and lending to several smaller marijuana companies. Also, it could expand into the U.S. adult-use market.


As for TLRY, it looks like a good marijuana company to buy from a business perspective. The company is a marijuana powerhouse with international operations and both medical and adult-use businesses. Also, count on the post-merger synergies and economies of scale to work for the new TLRY.



To sum it up, from a purely business perspective, you will bet on TLRY. However, if you are looking at betting on an investment vehicle that can capitalize on the troubles of some of the smaller marijuana companies, SNDL will fit the bill.",nhzt5b,"SNDL vs TLRY, comment your favorite"

# Investment Thesis I: Established Leader in the Marketplace

LendingTree’s competitive advantages in the marketplace differentiate them from other loan or insurance comparison-shopping marketplaces.

* **Speed:** easy-use; apply for loans in minutes and lock-in rates
* **Convenience:** search and apply for quotes 24/7 from anywhere in the world

   * Even in cities with  refinancing savings like Detroit present median savings of $23,409

# Investment Thesis II: Insurance Growth

* The insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and the number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Refer to chart ‘Segment Revenue’
   * Insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Expected revenue growth of 30% + compared to 2Q2020
* Acquisitions of QuoteWizard in 4Q2018 and ValuePenguin in 1Q2019 allowed them to enhance their insurance products 
   * QuoteWizard – one of the largest insurance comparison marketplaces in the growing online insurance advertising market
      * This acquisition established LendingTree as a leading player in the online insurance advertising industry while also allowing them to diversify their financial services category
      * Significant portion of their revenue growth in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was driven by their insurance leads business from this acquisition 
   * ValuePenguin – personal finance website that offers consumers objective analysis on variety of financial topics from insurance to credit cards
      * This acquisition provided immense value to insurance carriers and agents through their high-quality content and SEO capability – allowing them further scale in the insurance space
* New Medicare category for insurance growth showed significant promise during their first open-enrollment period in the 4Q2020
   * Presents a significant opportunity for their insurance segment 

# Major Risks 

**Consumer Demand Risk –** a general increase in interest rates may affect the ability of LendingTree’s mortgage Network Partners to close loans which will translate to lower revenues for LendingTree and ultimately affect their financial position

**Interest Rate Risk –** The Federal Reserve is currently printing out more money in order to keep the markets afloat due to COVID-19. In the long-term, this will cause inflation and the decreasing value of the USD. To combat this, the Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates

# Final Thoughts

The positive industry outlook and the prospective insurance segment of LendingTree that has generated high growth YoY strengthen analysts’ recommendations to BUY. Given a stock price forecast projecting a median price target of $320 (60.7% upside) and a low-price target of $200 (0.5% upside), I believe this stock still has a low of room for growth as they continue to diversify its revenue streams and expanding their financial services. Furthermore, I’ve provided a chart of analyst recommendations retrieved from CNN Business that strengthens the recommendation to BUY.

# W-Shape Note:

* We needed to close above 418 for the w-shape to be confirmed. This didn't happen :(
* Maybe next week?

# BULLS v BEARS - Who's in control?

* Essentially been consolidating since 5/11 (even longer if you zoom out - about 4/6 ish range)
* Short term - we've made higher low but not a higher high. We've made a lower high.
* This highlights uncertainty IMO. (iNfLaTiOn AnYoNe?)
* **410 break is still the line in the sand IMO.**
* **415 and above and market favors bulls IMO.**
* **410 and below and marker favors bears IMO.**

# 1D Timeframe

* We've hit heavy resistance at the gap fill - two full days with resistance @ gap fill.
* **IMO. We see 420+ or 405- next week. A higher-high or a lower-low! But let's see!**

4227,gz085v7,2021-05-22 00:38:14,t1_gz085v7,t3_ni1fw5,wallstreetbets,"""The problem is that technical analysis is a misnomer. Reading a chart is much more like playing piano than it is like running an analysis. Thus, we have entirely the wrong image for its study.  
  
Here’s what I mean: I’d bet that 90% of people who set out to play piano give up long before ever learning to play at a proficient level. An academic could argue, after a study of all people who have ever played piano, that playing piano is not statistically possible. In fact, it appears to be more about luck than skill—there are few variables that correlate to people who play piano well.  
  
What does correlate? Practice. People who practice piano everyday, for years, are the people who can play well. We can’t even really explain how—they just do. You can run all the linear regressions you want, all the mathematical analysis you want, it doesn’t help because you have approached the problem in entirely the wrong manner.  
  
Here is what we do know:  
  
1. The human mind is currently the most powerful pattern recognition software in the universe.  
a. Therefore, it recognizes nonexistent patterns in randomness.  
b. Therefore, it is capable of recognizing very subtle signals in noise.  
2. To recognize actual patterns, the mind must be trained.  
3. If something is profitable, people will do it.  
a. If something is not profitable, people will eventually stop doing it.  
4. People don’t like to work hard.  
  
Those facts combine to yield some interesting results. For example, combine 1a, 2, 3, and 4, and you have a recipe for crappy training programs (which we see a ton of). Combine 1a, 3a, and 4, and technical analysis ceases to exist.  
  
If you combine all of them, you get exactly what we see in the world: a TON of crappy training programs, a TON of people who put in little to no work then stop, and very few people who achieve any level of proficiency and reap hard-won profits.  
  
Which is exactly what you find with playing the piano.""

now you have to justify running a company at a loss.... since it is ran as a division of a other company you can use that money hole of a division to use for software development... but any only video based company is fucked because again this model doesn't work if it is just a video company....


how do they justify the millions or billions in losses well they use it to run data collection and software tends. 


now as they are a profit seeking company but they are offering a free unlimited service their costs to operate. the cost to operate is ever increasing at a faster and faster rate..... it costs more to run every year than the year before because billions of hours of video are uploaded every year.

However I was deep thinking, so I started digging.  We never recovered from the 08 crisis.  They just dropped interest rates and turned on the printer.  

Now in 11-12 I was a security guard for a company that made coins for the us mint/ tiff jewelry.  Gold was crazy 16-1700$ an once.  It’s gone up 150-200$ an oz in the decade where we printed more money than we have since our founding. 

What if the government knew they were fucked and told hedge funds to naked short everything till oblivion. 


Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there’s at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don’t have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.  

Apes look up academic papers from the 08 collapse and what’s going on now naked shorting is on the rise.  

It’s nuts

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

Inflation is gonna destroy non-asset holders. I’m a bit worried about discount retail (5 below, DG, Dollar Tree) holding up because the business models are predicated on selling commodities at a certain price point. If commodity prices skyrocket dollar tree especially is gonna have a tough time adjusting since literally everything in their store is a dollar. So I think the better bet is to buy the actual companies that create goods that the poor are capable of buying (since inflation will eradicate much of the middle class.) Vizio products would never be sold in one of these stores but they sell really cheap TVs with internet accessibility. They sell a really good product considering the price point. I check their books and it’s a profitable company that’s been improving margins that last two years. Pretty low market cap so I wouldn’t be shocked if a larger company sought to buy it in the future.

4736,,2021-05-21 07:40:32,t3_nhmv7n,,wallstreetbets,"Ford is great value investment considering it will compete with TESLA for EV market - Most of bear case is ford debt and they are 100% wrong. Please read below article.

**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    
**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford’s finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford’s automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford’s $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford’s $160 billion debt load.

From old post:

1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

4738,,2021-05-21 09:36:45,t3_nhoi3w,,wallstreetbets,"Virgin Galactic announced they have a test flight scheduled for tomorrow and the stock moved up by 14% yesterday. I’m overall bearish on this company, as founder Richard Branson and SPAC-backer Chamath Palihapitiya have both sold basically all of their shares. Cathie Woods doesn’t even own it for ARK. 

I want to buy puts in anticipation of a drop Monday, this seems like the most likely outcome to me. Whether the launch is a failure or people just sell the news after a big move, it seems unlikely that it continues to rally Monday. There’s a lot of bag holders who bought at $40-60 a couple months ago that would love to get out if it bounces which would theoretically limit its possible gains Monday. On the chance the test flight greatly exceeds expectations or there is another announcement included along side the test, the stock could fly however. I feel that this is a slim but non-zero possibility. Basically whichever way it moves, it’s going to move hard. June 4th options have an IV of 165% per thinkorswim. 

My question is whether I am better off buying straight puts on $SPCE or if I should buy some sort of call/put spread to hedge my downside in the event the stock continues to fly Monday. My main concern is making the right move and still getting IV crushed. I’m looking at 6/4/21 $20 puts, or a spread at the same strike and expiry. In your opinions, is that a smart move or is there something else I should be considering? I’m still relatively new to trading options. 

Thanks for your input!

Huawei had won 91 global 5G contracts.

I suspect Nokia will have a favorable win rate as others try to compete with ReefShark. Nokia’s AI-enabled chip ReefShark which is used to power Nokia’s 5G base stations made up 44% of 5G sales. ReefShark is on track to reach 70% of 5G sales by year’s end. ReefShark is Nokia’s most recent semiconductor that powers its 5G base stations.

The ReefShark chipset is smaller, decreasing the antenna size by half, which makes these base stations less bulky and obtrusive. It helps enable a 50 – 60% reduction in energy use compared to previous chips.

4742,,2021-05-21 11:44:07,t3_nhqhhk,,wallstreetbets,"Explosive fires have started everywhere already. Stock markets are on fire and so are property markets, as well as bond and debt markets. The problem is that fires are initially explosive but always end up implosive. 

How predictable events are (and people). This is particularly true in the world economy. Empires come and go, economies boom and bust and new currencies come and without fail always go. All this happens with regularity. 

&#x200B;

 Everything really on fire :

 We have seen  about inflation running wild and it is not just happening in stocks. Property markets are literarily exploding, especially the high end. We see this all over the world and not just in the US. In the UK for example, HSBC stated that March saw the highest number of mortgages EVER issued. In Sweden properties sell for up to 40% above asking price in a frenzied bidding war and second hand leisure boats are in such demand that they cost virtually the same as a new boat. And if you want a new boat, there is none available until 2022. It also seems that people are desperate for company after the lockdowns as prices for puppies in the UK are up to 100% higher than last year.

 Yes, everything is really on fire as people are desperate to just spend, spend, spend after a year of lockdowns and restrictions. 

 AN ECONOMIC BUBBLE OF AIR

 Since air is free, governments can produce unlimited amounts of it. And without exception, gullible people want to believe that it is actually real money and not just empty air. The beauty for the government is that they can just produce and borrow trillions of dollars at ZERO cost. And by manipulating interest rates they can borrow this money also at virtually ZERO cost. 

 So first the government manufactures the money at no cost and then they pay NOTHING for the privilege of borrowing that money. 

 The money obviously creates massive bubbles in stocks, bonds, houses, used cars , boats, puppies and other massively overvalued investments and consumer items. 

 Just look at how, for example, the Dow has gone up **exponentially and parabolically** **in the last year in an historically unprecedented straight line.** 

&#x200B;

**US Federal Debt up 74X**  
**Total US debt up “only” 49X**  
**M2 Money Supply up 29X>**

**Debt to GDP 1971: 37% – 2021: 127%**

 Bubbles are called bubbles because they consist of air. And when bubbles become too big, they ALWAYS and without fail burst and implode. 

 Technically markets are giving very clear signals that THE END IS NIGH.

Whether that means days weeks or a few months, is totally irrelevant. We know that we are at the end of the most remarkable period in history in regards to money, investments and the economy.

 GOLD, SILVER AND WEALTH PRESERVATION

Gold  and Silver  have not at all reflected the massive creation of money in the last 50 years. That catchup phase is likely to start very soon based on both fundamentals and technicals. 

As regards securing your finances in periods of crisis, gold and silver have always been critical to hold.

 Everyone can afford some gold or silver. An ounce of silver is $28 and one gramme of gold is $50. So saving in precious metals will not only be very useful but essential at whatever level you can afford.

 The upside potential for gold and silver is multiples of the current prices and that is at today’s price levels. Higher inflation could take the metals to unfathomable heights.

4744,,2021-05-21 12:45:14,t3_nhrmu8,,wallstreetbets,"FuboTV posted its Q1 results on the 11th. Seasonality in sports is obviously huge, with Q1 and Q2 being the worst periods of the season.

Consequently, there was always a sequential decline in the number of subscribers in Q1 and Q2 in 2019 and 2020. Typically between -8 and -9% sequentially. Given the amazing performance that was achieved in Q3 and Q4 last year, it was heavily expected that this Q1 would again see a decline in paid subscribers.

And then the results were published. For the first time in its history, Fubo delivered a sequential growth in paid subscribers and revenue in a Q1! The inflection point as been passed, the business momentum is stronger than the seasonality of sports. Looking ahead, with the Olympics, the soccer world cup qualifiers, the main leagues restarting everywhere, I expect massive growth in paid subscribers.

Now, onto the revenue side. The ARPU is approximately constant at around 69$/month since Q3 2020. The low seasonality of Q1 means that the relative share of ARPU due to the advertising is quite low compared to Q3 and Q4 last year. Which means that a great improvement of the subscription ARPU has been reached in Q1!

Now, when we'll go into Q3 and then Q4, with the absurd growth in number of subscribers and the massive gains from advertising, I'm expecting the ARPU to again grow. Expected advertising growth is 100% YOY.

And what happens when you combine massive subscribers and ARPU growth? You have massive results.

The cherries on the cake are:

1. Fubo betting which comes as a free version in Q3 and then paid version in Q4. It can be massive as Fubo will be the only player in the industry to control end to end the viewer/bettor experience.
2. International expansion, in Europe first probably, starting in 2022.
3. Accepting wagering in unconventional currencies.

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes – well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you’ll double your money. This isn’t some wishy washy bullshit oh it’s going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it’s just a question of when. How can I be so sure? They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.

Should you trust me? Am I financial advisor – good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips. Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago? We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can’t lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist? What the fuck does that mean – fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill. Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn’t just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine – kind of a big deal. They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year. Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe – think FDA is going to delay?

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no. They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted. Added bonus – Pfizer’s big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also – or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain’t going cheap. They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner. Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn’t allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth. The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes – former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – not piece of shit pharma we have here. Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks. You don’t have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear. No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential? Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities – hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men’s lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself. Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant’s drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued. MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down - whatever could they do with that cash? $44 a share wouldn’t even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down. With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in – remember this isn’t some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them. And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can’t see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone. FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they’ve already approved in new indications like this one. Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point. It’s down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason. FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density – the solution: they will monitor bone density. That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on – doesn’t that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer. Even if they don’t Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs. Truly can’t fucking lose. so why is it trading so cheap? Well cause no one knows about it, and the upside is only written down in Japanese.",nhssad,Guaranteed Buyout and Doubling of Funds if grab Myovant (MYOV)

We are approaching that time, and June/July could be a heavy shift in perspectives and R&D priorities. [Sen.

These UAP’s exhibit unexplainable flight characteristics: near instantaneous acceleration, airplane/submersible hybrid characteristics, visual disappearance, odd acoustics, etc. Also, multiple “types” of craft have been observed. 

There are patents filed by the Navy for inertial mass reduction craft (basically creating a quantum vacuum around the craft to avoid air/water resistance; useful to go Mach 16+ in the atmosphere). Here’s the patent: [Triangular UAP Patent?](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10144532B2/en). Additionally, we have heard rumors (and they may just be rumors) of anti-gravity temporal displacement craft. These craft can accelerate by utilizing gravity waves, bend light through a gravity well (stealthy), and externally perceived time could be affected as well (think Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar) ([Gravity Wave Patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10322827B2/) ) This UAP sightings might be manned craft or something else, or a mixture of both. These patents could also be counter-espionage missions to throw foreign countries off true technological breakthroughs, but we do know there was a demo of the tech: [Navy acknowledging demo, but not production ready](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/37134/emails-show-navys-ufo-patents-went-through-significant-internal-review-resulted-in-a-demo)

Okay great, so what’s the play…

([UFO Targeting Pod](https://sofrep.com/news/following-pentagon-admission-raytheon-touts-gear-ufo-spotter/))

**Long-Lockheed Martin ($LMT)** a major defense aerospace firm, which developed many prototypes over the years and is famous for the Skunkworks R&D lab.

These fragments are believed to be made of an unknown metal/alloy, and potentially 3D printed at an atomic level.

**Long-Northrup Grumman ($NOC)** is a defense giant which developed the B-2 stealth bomber and is a contractor on multiple space infrastructure missions. They would be vital for advanced composites/metallurgy, advanced avionics, spaceflight, and tracking systems.

What the fuck does that mean – fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill.  Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.  

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn’t just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine – kind of a big deal.  They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year.  Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe – think FDA is going to delay? 

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no.  They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted.  Added bonus – Pfizer’s big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also – or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain’t going cheap.  They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner.  Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn’t allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth.  The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes – former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – not piece of shit pharma we have here.  Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks.  You don’t have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear.  No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential?  Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities – hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men’s lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself.  Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant’s drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued.  MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down  - whatever could they do with that cash?  $44 a share wouldn’t even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down.  With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in – remember this isn’t some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them.  And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can’t see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone.  FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they’ve already approved in new indications like this one.  Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point.  It’s down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason.  FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density – the solution:  they will monitor bone density.  That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on – doesn’t that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer.  Even if they don’t Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs.  Truly can’t fucking lose.  so why is it trading so cheap? Well cause no one knows about it, and the upside is only written down in Japanese.",nhtad9,Guaranteed Buyout and Doubling of Funds if buy Myovant (MYOV)

Can't believe I'm gonna throw shade on a firm I used to love but they have REALLY gone down hill.  Don't feel like writing a wall of text but want to warn others who are thinking of switching into them so I'm just going to bullet point problems I've had.  If you are with them already and feel so-so about them... there are better options out there.  Moving money is a pain in the ass but it might be worth it.

**Issues I've had with them**

* Margin approval is like pulling teeth.  They want to grill you to death for like half an hour and slowly increase your options approval one step at a time (honestly some of those guys seem like idiots and I'm not sure how they got their certifications).  If they don't like exactly how you answer questions even as an experienced trader that's been doing it for a while, they will delay your application by up to 6 months before you can try again.  That hasn't happened to me fortunately but apparently they do that so I'm always very anxious talking to them.  I have $600k ish with them in all my accounts and my risk per trade is typically capped at $50-60k.  I tend to have extra cash if I need to average down or add something to hedge my position.  Never used margin even though I have it since it's required to do a lot of different trades.

* Frequent outages (especially at market open), error messages, slow to load in the browser portal.  Desktop platform ""StreetSmart"" is terrible IMO but I suppose that is a matter of taste.  They're portal option trading is otherwise aright, I've seen better and worse but nothing to write home about.

* $1k recently mysteriously disappeared in my account.  They were quick to correct it and apparently it's some ""very rare"" programming error but who the fuck knows for sure.  I'm sure a lot of retards out there don't even notice if money is ever missing.

* Finally, something that has always bothered me is that their execution doesn't seem that good.  With options especially +/- a couple pennies (or nickel for larger contracts) can actually make a huge difference on your P&L for a trade.  They are THE LEADER in PFOF revenue.  Fuck them.


When I joined them close to 20 years ago, I worshiped Charles Schwab.  You can google him but he was Good Guy broker when no one cared about retail back in the day.

4771,,2021-05-21 17:50:01,t3_nhyj2a,,wallstreetbets," **Before I talk Technical Analysis (TA), it is important to understand the following:**

Technical Analysis is absolute meaningless astrology unless the strategies and indicators used are statistically/quantitatively *proven to be meaningful*. There are a lot of articles being published (and even shared here) about TLRY's TA - ignore them. They have zero weight on Tilray's future. Most of these chart patterns, strategies, theories, ideas, etc. taught in traditional trading education come from early 1900's anecdotal theories, which were nothing more than early, primitive attempts to identify patterns in markets. But, this is a story and an explanation for another time.

**In-Depth MACD Explanation:**

Since it's a popular retail indicator, most of you probably already know what the Moving Average Converence/Divergence (MACD) is. However, it's usually not well understood. The MACD takes in three settings for Moving Averages (MA) and the two lines plotted on the indicator are calculated as so:

MACD Line: Short MA - Long MA

Signal Line: Signal MA of the MACD Line

This is actually an incredibly clever way of measuring momentum and trend-following. By taking the difference between two different MA periods, we get a second-derivative (i.e. acceleration). By default, the MACD is calculated an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and with period settings (12, 26, 9).

**So, onto TLRY's** ***potential*** **momentum shift:**

*Note that I said ""potential,"" because the land of quantitative/algorithmic trading is nothing more than a probability game developed through hypothesis testing.*

Today, TLRY experienced a MACD crossover with MACD settings (SMA, 28, 48, 32). Why these settings? Because I ran a statistical backtest on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and simulated over 140,000 settings in an attempt to find the best practical combination to signal price change over the next few days via MACD crossover (Fun fact: using a Simple Moving Average (SMA) *always* yields better results, no matter what symbol or asset class).

If I were to buy ever MACD (SMA, 28, 48, 32) crossover at the daily closing price and hold for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days, what would my results be? Here's the results for the SPY since 2003:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k8lmq168hi071.png?width=1885&format=png&auto=webp&s=1af5f7ce7e179b59a18a198aaab1447e6177afc8

Positive mean returns and a high win frequency are significant, with the 1st day after buying being the most important. So, now that we've seen it's general significance in large-cap, what are the backtested results for TLRY? Well, it's tough because Tilray hasn't had a publicly traded stock for very long, so the sample size is insufficiently small. But, take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/6d1lvnx9hi071.png?width=1932&format=png&auto=webp&s=24595178d1e6e808074bd46a7e8ad6a8442b3e98

It still holds some significance with the positive means and win frequencies. But obviously with only 9 crossovers happening in TLRY's lifetime, we can't take these numbers and fit them to any model.

**So, using the most statistically effective MACD period settings, TLRY** ***may*** **be getting a shift in momentum here fairly soon!**

I understand that my initial claims for the (28, 48, 32) settings were only tested on the SPY, and Tilray isn't large-cap growth. There is still more testing and solidifying to do. BUT, I figured you apes who are still holding are continually waiting for a confirmation bias, so here you go :)",nhyj2a,Tilray (TLRY) MACD Momentum Shift - Quantitative TA

Edit: nice close at 19$

You probably havent heard about [The Lion Electric Company](https://thelionelectric.com/). Its because its only been 2 weeks since they are officially listed on both [NYSE](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy5d2/nyselev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [TSX](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy67g/tsxlev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). Before that, you could only buy the SPAC's stock Northern Genesis Acquisition. This is when I first bought most of my shares.

Basic infos about the stock:
- currently worth 19 U$D (+30% this week and its the highest ever with ticker LEV)
- Market Cap 3,5 billion USD


What does the Lion do? They do 100% electric trucks and busses.
And yes there is a lot of competition in the EV market, but not that much for trucks. Lion doesnt make cars, only trucks. They also already have orders from Amazon and scholar institution. 


What makes me think LEV is a buy



1. Lion is going to open a manufacturing facility in Illinois worth about $500M. The Illinois government is financing $70M for this. When full operational, the factory will be able to produce 20,000 vehicles per year. It will be the biggest of its kind in the US. Lion says they plan they start production in mid-2022. 



2. Lion is also opening a battery factory in Quebec (Canada). The government is financing 100M CAD (roughly 82M USD) to help them build it. This means that not only Lion will make 100% electric trucks, they will also produce their own batteries which they could potentially sell to other businesses in the future. But most important is that they wont have to buy it from another. 



3. Canada will no longer allow to sell new gasoline vehicles by 2035 (it doesnt concern used cars). This is in 15 years (only? Lol). But a lot of companies already started their transition to 100% EV. And all the state owned business will buy from a Canadian company, because thats how Canada works most of the time. All the school busses and normal busses have to be replaced, and we know they wont buy from a Chinese company when there is a Canadian one available. So its probably going to be Lion Electric. You should also note that some private companies like Loblaws are already transitioning to EV, they bought a lot of Tesla trucks recently. However, Lion's trucks are not only Canadian but also expected to be cheaper and good quality. 



4. Lion has clients
Amazon made a contract with Lion to buy 2,500 trucks over 5 years. But theres a downside: Lion is obliged to reserve 500 trucks per year for Amazon, while Amazon isnt obliged to actually buy them. It means that if the trucks quality is deceiptive, its possible Amazon would not buy them. This would of course be horrible for the stock.
But Amazon isnt the only big client: First Student bought 260 busses from Lion. It was announced this week, and I can still feel the +30% impact on my portfolio. Everyday LEV went higher than the previous one. 



5. LEV has a huge potential for long term profit. I personally think the stock could reach 25USD before the end of the year, but it could be even more. And when the Illinois facility will finally open, the stock should go higher than 30. If you look up the Northern Genesis stock history (the SPAC that merged with Lion 3 weeks ago), you will see the stock was at 30+ in January, but it fell with all the EV market. If you dont buy LEV this year, it might be too late. Of course the stock will be way higher in 5 years than now, but the more profit the better, right?



So in my opinion, you will make 100% to 300% within 3-4 years with this stock. But I am not an expert and you dont have to trust me. I trust myself and mostly trust The Lion Electric Company. I am already making small profit from this investment.


Have a good day and may your portfolio be green!",nhyn43,LEV: Lion Electric is the underdog

As for TLRY, it looks like a good marijuana company to buy from a business perspective. The company is a marijuana powerhouse with international operations and both medical and adult-use businesses. Also, count on the post-merger synergies and economies of scale to work for the new TLRY.

   * Sales in January 2020 were 22% stronger than in December 2019
* 51% of mortgage lenders are non-banks
   * 5 of the largest mortgage lenders in the U.S are non-banks
* Projected $73.7B in loan origination for 2022
   * $35.6B from personal loans, $13.6B from small and medium entrepreneur loans, and $24.5B from refinancing student debt
   * Approx. 79.3% growth since loan origination value of $41.4B from 2017
* Pandemic-driven demand sent total home sales to the highest since 2006

# Investment Thesis I: Established Leader in the Marketplace

LendingTree’s competitive advantages in the marketplace differentiate them from other loan or insurance comparison-shopping marketplaces.

* **Speed:** easy-use; apply for loans in minutes and lock-in rates
* **Convenience:** search and apply for quotes 24/7 from anywhere in the world
* **Competitive Rates:** average buyer saves $125-$163 per month for interest
   * LendingTree has saved refinanced borrowers the most in San Francisco, San Diego and Los Angeles with median savings of $80,211, $77,740 and $73,954 respectively
   * Even in cities with  refinancing savings like Detroit present median savings of $23,409

# Investment Thesis II: Insurance Growth

* The insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and the number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Refer to chart ‘Segment Revenue’
   * Insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Expected revenue growth of 30% + compared to 2Q2020
* Acquisitions of QuoteWizard in 4Q2018 and ValuePenguin in 1Q2019 allowed them to enhance their insurance products 
   * QuoteWizard – one of the largest insurance comparison marketplaces in the growing online insurance advertising market
      * This acquisition established LendingTree as a leading player in the online insurance advertising industry while also allowing them to diversify their financial services category
      * Significant portion of their revenue growth in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was driven by their insurance leads business from this acquisition 
   * ValuePenguin – personal finance website that offers consumers objective analysis on variety of financial topics from insurance to credit cards
      * This acquisition provided immense value to insurance carriers and agents through their high-quality content and SEO capability – allowing them further scale in the insurance space
* New Medicare category for insurance growth showed significant promise during their first open-enrollment period in the 4Q2020
   * Presents a significant opportunity for their insurance segment 

# Major Risks 

**Consumer Demand Risk –** a general increase in interest rates may affect the ability of LendingTree’s mortgage Network Partners to close loans which will translate to lower revenues for LendingTree and ultimately affect their financial position

**Interest Rate Risk –** The Federal Reserve is currently printing out more money in order to keep the markets afloat due to COVID-19. In the long-term, this will cause inflation and the decreasing value of the USD. To combat this, the Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates

# Final Thoughts

The positive industry outlook and the prospective insurance segment of LendingTree that has generated high growth YoY strengthen analysts’ recommendations to BUY. Given a stock price forecast projecting a median price target of $320 (60.7% upside) and a low-price target of $200 (0.5% upside), I believe this stock still has a low of room for growth as they continue to diversify its revenue streams and expanding their financial services. Furthermore, I’ve provided a chart of analyst recommendations retrieved from CNN Business that strengthens the recommendation to BUY.

Large open interest & volume on the June 18 expiration date, any reason why there's x10 times the normal open interest on the options expiring June 18? over 15M shares to cover options in the money as of today

GOLD is a good value company, with over 12B in revenue in 2020 & market cap is only 3.5x last year's revenue. Over 2B/yr in earnings the last 2 years & 5B in cash. Most of the business is in Gold mining 20% is in copper. Commodity prices keep climbing higher, so it's a good hedge for inflation.

For full disclosure I own several calls at the $20, $22, $23  expiring in June-Sept as well as shares of GOLD for the long to medium term. I'm no financial advisor and I'm likely wrong.

The stock has been seeing some resistance at $25 lately, but if the price of gold per ounce ($1881 currently) crosses the $1890... June is going to be a very good month for Barrick Gold. It's a quality company in my opinion & the market is at a tipping point, so it's a good safety net (maybe...)

$29 by end of summer? Would love to hear your thoughts

# W-Shape Note:

* We needed to close above 418 for the w-shape to be confirmed. This didn't happen :(
* Maybe next week?

# BULLS v BEARS - Who's in control?

* Essentially been consolidating since 5/11 (even longer if you zoom out - about 4/6 ish range)
* Short term - we've made higher low but not a higher high. We've made a lower high.
* This highlights uncertainty IMO. (iNfLaTiOn AnYoNe?)
* **410 break is still the line in the sand IMO.**
* **415 and above and market favors bulls IMO.**
* **410 and below and marker favors bears IMO.**

# 1D Timeframe

* We've hit heavy resistance at the gap fill - two full days with resistance @ gap fill.
* **IMO. We see 420+ or 405- next week. A higher-high or a lower-low! But let's see!**

However I was deep thinking, so I started digging.  We never recovered from the 08 crisis.  They just dropped interest rates and turned on the printer.  

Now in 11-12 I was a security guard for a company that made coins for the us mint/ tiff jewelry.  Gold was crazy 16-1700$ an once.  It’s gone up 150-200$ an oz in the decade where we printed more money than we have since our founding. 

What if the government knew they were fucked and told hedge funds to naked short everything till oblivion. 


Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there’s at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don’t have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.  

Apes look up academic papers from the 08 collapse and what’s going on now naked shorting is on the rise.  

It’s nuts

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

Inflation is gonna destroy non-asset holders. I’m a bit worried about discount retail (5 below, DG, Dollar Tree) holding up because the business models are predicated on selling commodities at a certain price point. If commodity prices skyrocket dollar tree especially is gonna have a tough time adjusting since literally everything in their store is a dollar. So I think the better bet is to buy the actual companies that create goods that the poor are capable of buying (since inflation will eradicate much of the middle class.) Vizio products would never be sold in one of these stores but they sell really cheap TVs with internet accessibility. They sell a really good product considering the price point. I check their books and it’s a profitable company that’s been improving margins that last two years. Pretty low market cap so I wouldn’t be shocked if a larger company sought to buy it in the future.

5147,,2021-05-21 07:40:32,t3_nhmv7n,,wallstreetbets,"Ford is great value investment considering it will compete with TESLA for EV market - Most of bear case is ford debt and they are 100% wrong. Please read below article.

**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    
**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford’s finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford’s automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford’s $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford’s $160 billion debt load.

From old post:

1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

5149,,2021-05-21 09:36:45,t3_nhoi3w,,wallstreetbets,"Virgin Galactic announced they have a test flight scheduled for tomorrow and the stock moved up by 14% yesterday. I’m overall bearish on this company, as founder Richard Branson and SPAC-backer Chamath Palihapitiya have both sold basically all of their shares. Cathie Woods doesn’t even own it for ARK. 

I want to buy puts in anticipation of a drop Monday, this seems like the most likely outcome to me. Whether the launch is a failure or people just sell the news after a big move, it seems unlikely that it continues to rally Monday. There’s a lot of bag holders who bought at $40-60 a couple months ago that would love to get out if it bounces which would theoretically limit its possible gains Monday. On the chance the test flight greatly exceeds expectations or there is another announcement included along side the test, the stock could fly however. I feel that this is a slim but non-zero possibility. Basically whichever way it moves, it’s going to move hard. June 4th options have an IV of 165% per thinkorswim. 

My question is whether I am better off buying straight puts on $SPCE or if I should buy some sort of call/put spread to hedge my downside in the event the stock continues to fly Monday. My main concern is making the right move and still getting IV crushed. I’m looking at 6/4/21 $20 puts, or a spread at the same strike and expiry. In your opinions, is that a smart move or is there something else I should be considering? I’m still relatively new to trading options. 

Thanks for your input!

I suspect Nokia will have a favorable win rate as others try to compete with ReefShark. Nokia’s AI-enabled chip ReefShark which is used to power Nokia’s 5G base stations made up 44% of 5G sales. ReefShark is on track to reach 70% of 5G sales by year’s end. ReefShark is Nokia’s most recent semiconductor that powers its 5G base stations.

The ReefShark chipset is smaller, decreasing the antenna size by half, which makes these base stations less bulky and obtrusive.

5153,,2021-05-21 11:44:07,t3_nhqhhk,,wallstreetbets,"Explosive fires have started everywhere already. Stock markets are on fire and so are property markets, as well as bond and debt markets. The problem is that fires are initially explosive but always end up implosive. 

How predictable events are (and people). This is particularly true in the world economy. Empires come and go, economies boom and bust and new currencies come and without fail always go. All this happens with regularity. 

&#x200B;

 Everything really on fire :

 We have seen  about inflation running wild and it is not just happening in stocks. Property markets are literarily exploding, especially the high end. We see this all over the world and not just in the US. In the UK for example, HSBC stated that March saw the highest number of mortgages EVER issued. In Sweden properties sell for up to 40% above asking price in a frenzied bidding war and second hand leisure boats are in such demand that they cost virtually the same as a new boat. And if you want a new boat, there is none available until 2022. It also seems that people are desperate for company after the lockdowns as prices for puppies in the UK are up to 100% higher than last year.

 Yes, everything is really on fire as people are desperate to just spend, spend, spend after a year of lockdowns and restrictions. 

 AN ECONOMIC BUBBLE OF AIR

 Since air is free, governments can produce unlimited amounts of it. And without exception, gullible people want to believe that it is actually real money and not just empty air. The beauty for the government is that they can just produce and borrow trillions of dollars at ZERO cost. And by manipulating interest rates they can borrow this money also at virtually ZERO cost. 

 So first the government manufactures the money at no cost and then they pay NOTHING for the privilege of borrowing that money. 

 The money obviously creates massive bubbles in stocks, bonds, houses, used cars , boats, puppies and other massively overvalued investments and consumer items. 

 Just look at how, for example, the Dow has gone up **exponentially and parabolically** **in the last year in an historically unprecedented straight line.** 

&#x200B;

**US Federal Debt up 74X**  
**Total US debt up “only” 49X**  
**M2 Money Supply up 29X>**

**Debt to GDP 1971: 37% – 2021: 127%**

 Bubbles are called bubbles because they consist of air. And when bubbles become too big, they ALWAYS and without fail burst and implode. 

 Technically markets are giving very clear signals that THE END IS NIGH.

Whether that means days weeks or a few months, is totally irrelevant. We know that we are at the end of the most remarkable period in history in regards to money, investments and the economy.

 GOLD, SILVER AND WEALTH PRESERVATION

Gold  and Silver  have not at all reflected the massive creation of money in the last 50 years. That catchup phase is likely to start very soon based on both fundamentals and technicals. 

As regards securing your finances in periods of crisis, gold and silver have always been critical to hold.

 Everyone can afford some gold or silver. An ounce of silver is $28 and one gramme of gold is $50. So saving in precious metals will not only be very useful but essential at whatever level you can afford.

 The upside potential for gold and silver is multiples of the current prices and that is at today’s price levels. Higher inflation could take the metals to unfathomable heights.

5155,,2021-05-21 12:45:14,t3_nhrmu8,,wallstreetbets,"FuboTV posted its Q1 results on the 11th. Seasonality in sports is obviously huge, with Q1 and Q2 being the worst periods of the season.

Consequently, there was always a sequential decline in the number of subscribers in Q1 and Q2 in 2019 and 2020. Typically between -8 and -9% sequentially. Given the amazing performance that was achieved in Q3 and Q4 last year, it was heavily expected that this Q1 would again see a decline in paid subscribers.

And then the results were published. For the first time in its history, Fubo delivered a sequential growth in paid subscribers and revenue in a Q1! The inflection point as been passed, the business momentum is stronger than the seasonality of sports. Looking ahead, with the Olympics, the soccer world cup qualifiers, the main leagues restarting everywhere, I expect massive growth in paid subscribers.

Now, onto the revenue side. The ARPU is approximately constant at around 69$/month since Q3 2020. The low seasonality of Q1 means that the relative share of ARPU due to the advertising is quite low compared to Q3 and Q4 last year. Which means that a great improvement of the subscription ARPU has been reached in Q1!

Now, when we'll go into Q3 and then Q4, with the absurd growth in number of subscribers and the massive gains from advertising, I'm expecting the ARPU to again grow. Expected advertising growth is 100% YOY.

And what happens when you combine massive subscribers and ARPU growth? You have massive results.

The cherries on the cake are:

1. Fubo betting which comes as a free version in Q3 and then paid version in Q4. It can be massive as Fubo will be the only player in the industry to control end to end the viewer/bettor experience.
2. International expansion, in Europe first probably, starting in 2022.
3. Accepting wagering in unconventional currencies.

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes – well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you’ll double your money. This isn’t some wishy washy bullshit oh it’s going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it’s just a question of when. How can I be so sure? They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.

Should you trust me? Am I financial advisor – good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips. Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago? We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can’t lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist? What the fuck does that mean – fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill. Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn’t just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine – kind of a big deal. They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year. Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe – think FDA is going to delay?

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no. They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted. Added bonus – Pfizer’s big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also – or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain’t going cheap. They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner. Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn’t allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth. The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes – former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – not piece of shit pharma we have here. Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks. You don’t have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear. No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential? Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities – hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men’s lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself. Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant’s drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued. MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down - whatever could they do with that cash? $44 a share wouldn’t even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down. With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in – remember this isn’t some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them. And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can’t see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone. FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they’ve already approved in new indications like this one. Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point. It’s down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason. FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density – the solution: they will monitor bone density. That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on – doesn’t that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer. Even if they don’t Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs. Truly can’t fucking lose. so why is it trading so cheap? Well cause no one knows about it, and the upside is only written down in Japanese.",nhssad,Guaranteed Buyout and Doubling of Funds if grab Myovant (MYOV)

It was Congressionally mandated in the last stimulus bill and gave the government 180 days to release an unclassified report to the general public and a classified report to congress. We are approaching that time, and June/July could be a heavy shift in perspectives and R&D priorities. [Sen.

These UAP’s exhibit unexplainable flight characteristics: near instantaneous acceleration, airplane/submersible hybrid characteristics, visual disappearance, odd acoustics, etc. Also, multiple “types” of craft have been observed. 

There are patents filed by the Navy for inertial mass reduction craft (basically creating a quantum vacuum around the craft to avoid air/water resistance; useful to go Mach 16+ in the atmosphere). Here’s the patent: [Triangular UAP Patent?](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10144532B2/en). Additionally, we have heard rumors (and they may just be rumors) of anti-gravity temporal displacement craft. These craft can accelerate by utilizing gravity waves, bend light through a gravity well (stealthy), and externally perceived time could be affected as well (think Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar) ([Gravity Wave Patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10322827B2/) ) This UAP sightings might be manned craft or something else, or a mixture of both. These patents could also be counter-espionage missions to throw foreign countries off true technological breakthroughs, but we do know there was a demo of the tech: [Navy acknowledging demo, but not production ready](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/37134/emails-show-navys-ufo-patents-went-through-significant-internal-review-resulted-in-a-demo)

Okay great, so what’s the play…

**Long-Raytheon ($RTX)** has the Advanced Targeting Forward Look Infrared Sensor, which can be utilized to track UAP’s. This technology has been out for over a decade.

([UFO Targeting Pod](https://sofrep.com/news/following-pentagon-admission-raytheon-touts-gear-ufo-spotter/))

**Long-Lockheed Martin ($LMT)** a major defense aerospace firm, which developed many prototypes over the years and is famous for the Skunkworks R&D lab. Former Senator Harry Reid believes Lockheed has UAP fragments in their possession ([UAP Fragments](https://deadline.com/2021/04/ufo-fragments-in-possession-lockheed-martin-says-harry-reid-1234748095/)). These fragments are believed to be made of an unknown metal/alloy, and potentially 3D printed at an atomic level.

**Long-Northrup Grumman ($NOC)** is a defense giant which developed the B-2 stealth bomber and is a contractor on multiple space infrastructure missions. They would be vital for advanced composites/metallurgy, advanced avionics, spaceflight, and tracking systems.

Additionally, we have no clear knowledge of where the Chinese and Russians are at with this technology. Maybe this is partly why we founded Space Force?

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes – well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you’ll double your money.  This isn’t some wishy washy bullshit oh it’s going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it’s just a question of when.  How can I be so sure?  They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.  

Should you trust me?  Am I financial advisor – good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips.  Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago?  We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can’t lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist?  What the fuck does that mean – fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill.  Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.  

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn’t just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine – kind of a big deal.  They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year.  Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe – think FDA is going to delay? 

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no.  They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted.  Added bonus – Pfizer’s big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also – or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain’t going cheap.  They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner.  Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn’t allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth.  The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes – former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – not piece of shit pharma we have here.  Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks.  You don’t have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear.  No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential?  Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities – hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men’s lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself.  Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant’s drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued.  MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down  - whatever could they do with that cash?  $44 a share wouldn’t even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down.  With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in – remember this isn’t some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them.  And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can’t see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone.  FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they’ve already approved in new indications like this one.  Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point.  It’s down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason.  FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density – the solution:  they will monitor bone density.  That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on – doesn’t that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer.  Even if they don’t Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs.  Truly can’t fucking lose.  so why is it trading so cheap? Well cause no one knows about it, and the upside is only written down in Japanese.",nhtad9,Guaranteed Buyout and Doubling of Funds if buy Myovant (MYOV)

Can't believe I'm gonna throw shade on a firm I used to love but they have REALLY gone down hill.  Don't feel like writing a wall of text but want to warn others who are thinking of switching into them so I'm just going to bullet point problems I've had.  If you are with them already and feel so-so about them... there are better options out there.  Moving money is a pain in the ass but it might be worth it.

**Issues I've had with them**

* Margin approval is like pulling teeth.  They want to grill you to death for like half an hour and slowly increase your options approval one step at a time (honestly some of those guys seem like idiots and I'm not sure how they got their certifications).  If they don't like exactly how you answer questions even as an experienced trader that's been doing it for a while, they will delay your application by up to 6 months before you can try again.  That hasn't happened to me fortunately but apparently they do that so I'm always very anxious talking to them.  I have $600k ish with them in all my accounts and my risk per trade is typically capped at $50-60k.  I tend to have extra cash if I need to average down or add something to hedge my position.  Never used margin even though I have it since it's required to do a lot of different trades.

* Frequent outages (especially at market open), error messages, slow to load in the browser portal.  Desktop platform ""StreetSmart"" is terrible IMO but I suppose that is a matter of taste.  They're portal option trading is otherwise aright, I've seen better and worse but nothing to write home about.

* $1k recently mysteriously disappeared in my account.  They were quick to correct it and apparently it's some ""very rare"" programming error but who the fuck knows for sure.  I'm sure a lot of retards out there don't even notice if money is ever missing.

* Finally, something that has always bothered me is that their execution doesn't seem that good.  With options especially +/- a couple pennies (or nickel for larger contracts) can actually make a huge difference on your P&L for a trade.  They are THE LEADER in PFOF revenue.  Fuck them.


When I joined them close to 20 years ago, I worshiped Charles Schwab.  You can google him but he was Good Guy broker when no one cared about retail back in the day.

5182,,2021-05-21 17:50:01,t3_nhyj2a,,wallstreetbets," **Before I talk Technical Analysis (TA), it is important to understand the following:**

Technical Analysis is absolute meaningless astrology unless the strategies and indicators used are statistically/quantitatively *proven to be meaningful*. There are a lot of articles being published (and even shared here) about TLRY's TA - ignore them. They have zero weight on Tilray's future. Most of these chart patterns, strategies, theories, ideas, etc. taught in traditional trading education come from early 1900's anecdotal theories, which were nothing more than early, primitive attempts to identify patterns in markets. But, this is a story and an explanation for another time.

**In-Depth MACD Explanation:**

Since it's a popular retail indicator, most of you probably already know what the Moving Average Converence/Divergence (MACD) is. However, it's usually not well understood. The MACD takes in three settings for Moving Averages (MA) and the two lines plotted on the indicator are calculated as so:

MACD Line: Short MA - Long MA

Signal Line: Signal MA of the MACD Line

This is actually an incredibly clever way of measuring momentum and trend-following. By taking the difference between two different MA periods, we get a second-derivative (i.e. acceleration). By default, the MACD is calculated an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and with period settings (12, 26, 9).

**So, onto TLRY's** ***potential*** **momentum shift:**

*Note that I said ""potential,"" because the land of quantitative/algorithmic trading is nothing more than a probability game developed through hypothesis testing.*

Today, TLRY experienced a MACD crossover with MACD settings (SMA, 28, 48, 32). Why these settings? Because I ran a statistical backtest on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and simulated over 140,000 settings in an attempt to find the best practical combination to signal price change over the next few days via MACD crossover (Fun fact: using a Simple Moving Average (SMA) *always* yields better results, no matter what symbol or asset class).

If I were to buy ever MACD (SMA, 28, 48, 32) crossover at the daily closing price and hold for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days, what would my results be? Here's the results for the SPY since 2003:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k8lmq168hi071.png?width=1885&format=png&auto=webp&s=1af5f7ce7e179b59a18a198aaab1447e6177afc8

Positive mean returns and a high win frequency are significant, with the 1st day after buying being the most important. So, now that we've seen it's general significance in large-cap, what are the backtested results for TLRY? Well, it's tough because Tilray hasn't had a publicly traded stock for very long, so the sample size is insufficiently small. But, take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/6d1lvnx9hi071.png?width=1932&format=png&auto=webp&s=24595178d1e6e808074bd46a7e8ad6a8442b3e98

It still holds some significance with the positive means and win frequencies. But obviously with only 9 crossovers happening in TLRY's lifetime, we can't take these numbers and fit them to any model.

**So, using the most statistically effective MACD period settings, TLRY** ***may*** **be getting a shift in momentum here fairly soon!**

I understand that my initial claims for the (28, 48, 32) settings were only tested on the SPY, and Tilray isn't large-cap growth. There is still more testing and solidifying to do. BUT, I figured you apes who are still holding are continually waiting for a confirmation bias, so here you go :)",nhyj2a,Tilray (TLRY) MACD Momentum Shift - Quantitative TA

You probably havent heard about [The Lion Electric Company](https://thelionelectric.com/). Its because its only been 2 weeks since they are officially listed on both [NYSE](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy5d2/nyselev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [TSX](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy67g/tsxlev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). Before that, you could only buy the SPAC's stock Northern Genesis Acquisition. This is when I first bought most of my shares.

Basic infos about the stock:
- currently worth 19 U$D (+30% this week and its the highest ever with ticker LEV)
- Market Cap 3,5 billion USD


What does the Lion do? They do 100% electric trucks and busses.
And yes there is a lot of competition in the EV market, but not that much for trucks. Lion doesnt make cars, only trucks. They also already have orders from Amazon and scholar institution. 


What makes me think LEV is a buy



1. Lion is going to open a manufacturing facility in Illinois worth about $500M. The Illinois government is financing $70M for this. When full operational, the factory will be able to produce 20,000 vehicles per year. It will be the biggest of its kind in the US. Lion says they plan they start production in mid-2022. 



2. Lion is also opening a battery factory in Quebec (Canada). The government is financing 100M CAD (roughly 82M USD) to help them build it. This means that not only Lion will make 100% electric trucks, they will also produce their own batteries which they could potentially sell to other businesses in the future. But most important is that they wont have to buy it from another. 



3. Quebec will no longer allow to sell new gasoline vehicles by 2035 (it doesnt concern used cars). This is in 15 years (only? Lol). But a lot of companies already started their transition to 100% EV. And all the state owned business will buy from a Canadian company, because thats how Canada works most of the time. All the school busses and normal busses have to be replaced, and we know they wont buy from a Chinese company when there is a Quebecker one available. So its probably going to be Lion Electric. You should also note that some private companies like Loblaws are already transitioning to EV, they bought a lot of Tesla trucks recently. However, Lion's trucks are not only local but also expected to be cheaper and good quality. 



4. Lion has clients
Amazon made a contract with Lion to buy 2,500 trucks over 5 years. But theres a downside: Lion is obliged to reserve 500 trucks per year for Amazon, while Amazon isnt obliged to actually buy them. It means that if the trucks quality is deceiptive, its possible Amazon would not buy them. This would of course be horrible for the stock.
But Amazon isnt the only big client: First Student bought 260 busses from Lion. It was announced this week, and I can still feel the +30% impact on my portfolio. Everyday LEV went higher than the previous one. 



5. LEV has a huge potential for long term profit. I personally think the stock could reach 25USD before the end of the year, but it could be even more. And when the Illinois facility will finally open, the stock should go higher than 30. If you look up the Northern Genesis stock history (the SPAC that merged with Lion 3 weeks ago), you will see the stock was at 30+ in January, but it fell with all the EV market. If you dont buy LEV this year, it might be too late. Of course the stock will be way higher in 5 years than now, but the more profit the better, right?



So in my opinion, you will make 100% to 300% within 3-4 years with this stock. But I am not an expert and you dont have to trust me. I trust myself and mostly trust The Lion Electric Company. I am already making small profit from this investment.


Have a good day and may your portfolio be green!",nhyn43,LEV: Lion Electric is the underdog

As for TLRY, it looks like a good marijuana company to buy from a business perspective. The company is a marijuana powerhouse with international operations and both medical and adult-use businesses. Also, count on the post-merger synergies and economies of scale to work for the new TLRY.

# Investment Thesis I: Established Leader in the Marketplace

LendingTree’s competitive advantages in the marketplace differentiate them from other loan or insurance comparison-shopping marketplaces.

* **Speed:** easy-use; apply for loans in minutes and lock-in rates
* **Convenience:** search and apply for quotes 24/7 from anywhere in the world
* **Competitive Rates:** average buyer saves $125-$163 per month for interest
   * LendingTree has saved refinanced borrowers the most in San Francisco, San Diego and Los Angeles with median savings of $80,211, $77,740 and $73,954 respectively
   * Even in cities with  refinancing savings like Detroit present median savings of $23,409

# Investment Thesis II: Insurance Growth

* The insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and the number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Refer to chart ‘Segment Revenue’
   * Insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Expected revenue growth of 30% + compared to 2Q2020
* Acquisitions of QuoteWizard in 4Q2018 and ValuePenguin in 1Q2019 allowed them to enhance their insurance products 
   * QuoteWizard – one of the largest insurance comparison marketplaces in the growing online insurance advertising market
      * This acquisition established LendingTree as a leading player in the online insurance advertising industry while also allowing them to diversify their financial services category
      * Significant portion of their revenue growth in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was driven by their insurance leads business from this acquisition 
   * ValuePenguin – personal finance website that offers consumers objective analysis on variety of financial topics from insurance to credit cards
      * This acquisition provided immense value to insurance carriers and agents through their high-quality content and SEO capability – allowing them further scale in the insurance space
* New Medicare category for insurance growth showed significant promise during their first open-enrollment period in the 4Q2020
   * Presents a significant opportunity for their insurance segment 

# Major Risks 

**Consumer Demand Risk –** a general increase in interest rates may affect the ability of LendingTree’s mortgage Network Partners to close loans which will translate to lower revenues for LendingTree and ultimately affect their financial position

**Interest Rate Risk –** The Federal Reserve is currently printing out more money in order to keep the markets afloat due to COVID-19. In the long-term, this will cause inflation and the decreasing value of the USD. To combat this, the Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates

# Final Thoughts

The positive industry outlook and the prospective insurance segment of LendingTree that has generated high growth YoY strengthen analysts’ recommendations to BUY. Given a stock price forecast projecting a median price target of $320 (60.7% upside) and a low-price target of $200 (0.5% upside), I believe this stock still has a low of room for growth as they continue to diversify its revenue streams and expanding their financial services. Furthermore, I’ve provided a chart of analyst recommendations retrieved from CNN Business that strengthens the recommendation to BUY.

Large open interest & volume on the June 18 expiration date, any reason why there's x10 times the normal open interest on the options expiring June 18? over 15M shares to cover options in the money as of today

GOLD is a good value company, with over 12B in revenue in 2020 & market cap is only 3.5x last year's revenue. Over 2B/yr in earnings the last 2 years & 5B in cash. Most of the business is in Gold mining 20% is in copper. Commodity prices keep climbing higher, so it's a good hedge for inflation.

For full disclosure I own several calls at the $20, $22, $23  expiring in June-Sept as well as shares of GOLD for the long to medium term. I'm no financial advisor and I'm likely wrong.

The stock has been seeing some resistance at $25 lately, but if the price of gold per ounce ($1881 currently) crosses the $1890... June is going to be a very good month for Barrick Gold. It's a quality company in my opinion & the market is at a tipping point, so it's a good safety net (maybe...)

$29 by end of summer? Would love to hear your thoughts

# W-Shape Note:

* We needed to close above 418 for the w-shape to be confirmed. This didn't happen :(
* Maybe next week?

# BULLS v BEARS - Who's in control?

* Essentially been consolidating since 5/11 (even longer if you zoom out - about 4/6 ish range)
* Short term - we've made higher low but not a higher high. We've made a lower high.
* This highlights uncertainty IMO. (iNfLaTiOn AnYoNe?)
* **410 break is still the line in the sand IMO.**
* **415 and above and market favors bulls IMO.**
* **410 and below and marker favors bears IMO.**

# 1D Timeframe

* We've hit heavy resistance at the gap fill - two full days with resistance @ gap fill.
* **IMO. We see 420+ or 405- next week. A higher-high or a lower-low! But let's see!**

It might be to their advantage to do so because they are able to profit off of the availability of COMEX -- but at what price?  
In other words, saving COMEX yet again may be becoming just too *expensive* for JPM's bean counters/risk managers.  
Or maybe they simply don't have the available unencumbered silver to do this with any longer.  
JPM and their billion ounce mountain of silver may be a paper tiger. 

&#x200B;

Lets dign in !

**Comex silver warehouse .... another 1,000,000 oz is OUT OF THE VAULT, 43,000,000 oz is gone since the silverbacks arrived. This time it is all HSBC bank. And what did big powerful JP Morgan do? Nothing!! Maybe all their silver eligible is spoken for.** 

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

The long story can be read in the links below.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418.
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

Now in 11-12 I was a security guard for a company that made coins for the us mint/ tiff jewelry.  Gold was crazy 16-1700$ an once.  It’s gone up 150-200$ an oz in the decade where we printed more money than we have since our founding. 

What if the government knew they were fucked and told hedge funds to naked short everything till oblivion. 


Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there’s at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don’t have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.  

Apes look up academic papers from the 08 collapse and what’s going on now naked shorting is on the rise.  

It’s nuts

From there it’ll be up to the local politicians for action.",nhimlx,Does the government and fed allow/ encourage naked shorting.

This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let’s go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don’t need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there’s a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

Overall, I’m bullish and have over 30 call contracts expiring this July 🚀🚀🚀",nhdnzi,Bull Cruise $CCL primed to explode 🚀🚀📈🚀

There is little difference in their lines of business at the moment, margins are similar, products are similar. There’s very little differentiation, he’ll they’re in the same city. UWMC has had a better post-earnings period not because their top line YOY growth was so good or even indicative of something remotely possible to sustain moving forward, but really just because of the dividend and chest pounding against RKT.

I have a position in both, and before either camp starts screaming about how one is more revolutionary, or has better blah blah blah, realize that the only thing driving price action for either is public sentiment. UWMC declared a regular dividend while RKT only a special. 

Next week, either Jay Farner gets flashy (new dividend, massive auto rollout, something new) and starts publicly pushing back against Ishbia, or RKT continues downward. I think it’s 50/50 but looks ripe for anyone looking for a straddle yolo, with IV not as bad as it was before.

It might be to their advantage to do so because they are able to profit off of the availability of COMEX -- but at what price?  
In other words, saving COMEX yet again may be becoming just too *expensive* for JPM's bean counters/risk managers.  
Or maybe they simply don't have the available unencumbered silver to do this with any longer.  
JPM and their billion ounce mountain of silver may be a paper tiger. 

&#x200B;

Lets dign in !

**Comex silver warehouse .... another 1,000,000 oz is OUT OF THE VAULT, 43,000,000 oz is gone since the silverbacks arrived. This time it is all HSBC bank. And what did big powerful JP Morgan do? Nothing!! Maybe all their silver eligible is spoken for.** 

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

The long story can be read in the links below.

W-shape with today's price action.

* For the w-shape to hold true we need to push over 418.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418.
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

Then you know we kinda just said nah stocks only go up and injected a shit ton of money. The question is how much do we fear a healthy pullback. Because we feared it so much that time we really made it twice as bad when we finally do let it happen or run out of options to keep it going. We’ll get one but when we let it happen, that’s a lot harder to time I feel. Everything going back to normal in life is very positive news but the market obviously isn’t taking it as so positive. When it is a mostly normal again in a few months do we see stocks start to go up again and say we weathered the storm using policy and action, or do we see stocks return to “normal” preCOVID levels too? Right now it’s looking like the more positive news that comes out is taking those 2020-2021 gains from the companies that spiked during that time. I’m almost all in on VIAC right now after averaging down my 6/18 50c the last few weeks and at break even now. After hopefully taking some profit next week I don’t think I’m going to make any really big moves for awhile. It’s getting harder and harder this year to make the type of trades I make and longer horizons to potential profit. I don’t think I want to expose that much capital for a month at a time with all those questions above unanswered. Not going cash gang but maybe splitting it up and selling CC on a few things for awhile to see what happens.",,

I could have (and would have) had 20 Calls expy 2022 instead of 2 if I had any idea how the Greeks worked back then. 

It kills me cause I was posting my position on damn near every comment in nov/Dec and not even 1 person bothered to tell me that spending large amounts of capital on deep ITM calls is actually the worst way to set up that position if you were expecting a squeeze.",,

Tell recently cleaned up their debt, diluted shares to position themselves for growth (this would be a bad sign if they didnt just pay off a bunch of loans), and essentially did a big PR event saying they're going to start making actual progress again soon.

During that time we saw it go from 1.80 back to 2.60, Short interest drop, institutional ownership double.

Now in 11-12 I was a security guard for a company that made coins for the us mint/ tiff jewelry.  Gold was crazy 16-1700$ an once.  It’s gone up 150-200$ an oz in the decade where we printed more money than we have since our founding. 

What if the government knew they were fucked and told hedge funds to naked short everything till oblivion. 


Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there’s at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don’t have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.  

Apes look up academic papers from the 08 collapse and what’s going on now naked shorting is on the rise.

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

TLDR; BIGC good, like SHOP, but undervalued.

Inflation is gonna destroy non-asset holders. I’m a bit worried about discount retail (5 below, DG, Dollar Tree) holding up because the business models are predicated on selling commodities at a certain price point. If commodity prices skyrocket dollar tree especially is gonna have a tough time adjusting since literally everything in their store is a dollar. So I think the better bet is to buy the actual companies that create goods that the poor are capable of buying (since inflation will eradicate much of the middle class.) Vizio products would never be sold in one of these stores but they sell really cheap TVs with internet accessibility. They sell a really good product considering the price point. I check their books and it’s a profitable company that’s been improving margins that last two years. Pretty low market cap so I wouldn’t be shocked if a larger company sought to buy it in the future.

6693,,2021-05-21 07:40:32,t3_nhmv7n,,wallstreetbets,"Ford is great value investment considering it will compete with TESLA for EV market - Most of bear case is ford debt and they are 100% wrong. Please read below article.

**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    
**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford’s finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford’s automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford’s $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford’s $160 billion debt load.

From old post:

1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

6695,,2021-05-21 09:36:45,t3_nhoi3w,,wallstreetbets,"Virgin Galactic announced they have a test flight scheduled for tomorrow and the stock moved up by 14% yesterday. I’m overall bearish on this company, as founder Richard Branson and SPAC-backer Chamath Palihapitiya have both sold basically all of their shares. Cathie Woods doesn’t even own it for ARK. 

I want to buy puts in anticipation of a drop Monday, this seems like the most likely outcome to me. Whether the launch is a failure or people just sell the news after a big move, it seems unlikely that it continues to rally Monday. There’s a lot of bag holders who bought at $40-60 a couple months ago that would love to get out if it bounces which would theoretically limit its possible gains Monday. On the chance the test flight greatly exceeds expectations or there is another announcement included along side the test, the stock could fly however. I feel that this is a slim but non-zero possibility. Basically whichever way it moves, it’s going to move hard. June 4th options have an IV of 165% per thinkorswim. 

My question is whether I am better off buying straight puts on $SPCE or if I should buy some sort of call/put spread to hedge my downside in the event the stock continues to fly Monday. My main concern is making the right move and still getting IV crushed. I’m looking at 6/4/21 $20 puts, or a spread at the same strike and expiry. In your opinions, is that a smart move or is there something else I should be considering? I’m still relatively new to trading options. 

Thanks for your input!

Huawei had won 91 global 5G contracts.

I suspect Nokia will have a favorable win rate as others try to compete with ReefShark. Nokia’s AI-enabled chip ReefShark which is used to power Nokia’s 5G base stations made up 44% of 5G sales. ReefShark is on track to reach 70% of 5G sales by year’s end. ReefShark is Nokia’s most recent semiconductor that powers its 5G base stations.

The ReefShark chipset is smaller, decreasing the antenna size by half, which makes these base stations less bulky and obtrusive. It helps enable a 50 – 60% reduction in energy use compared to previous chips.

6699,,2021-05-21 11:44:07,t3_nhqhhk,,wallstreetbets,"Explosive fires have started everywhere already. Stock markets are on fire and so are property markets, as well as bond and debt markets. The problem is that fires are initially explosive but always end up implosive. 

How predictable events are (and people). This is particularly true in the world economy. Empires come and go, economies boom and bust and new currencies come and without fail always go. All this happens with regularity. 

&#x200B;

 Everything really on fire :

 We have seen  about inflation running wild and it is not just happening in stocks. Property markets are literarily exploding, especially the high end. We see this all over the world and not just in the US. In the UK for example, HSBC stated that March saw the highest number of mortgages EVER issued. In Sweden properties sell for up to 40% above asking price in a frenzied bidding war and second hand leisure boats are in such demand that they cost virtually the same as a new boat. And if you want a new boat, there is none available until 2022. It also seems that people are desperate for company after the lockdowns as prices for puppies in the UK are up to 100% higher than last year.

 Yes, everything is really on fire as people are desperate to just spend, spend, spend after a year of lockdowns and restrictions. 

 AN ECONOMIC BUBBLE OF AIR

 Since air is free, governments can produce unlimited amounts of it. And without exception, gullible people want to believe that it is actually real money and not just empty air. The beauty for the government is that they can just produce and borrow trillions of dollars at ZERO cost. And by manipulating interest rates they can borrow this money also at virtually ZERO cost. 

 So first the government manufactures the money at no cost and then they pay NOTHING for the privilege of borrowing that money. 

 The money obviously creates massive bubbles in stocks, bonds, houses, used cars , boats, puppies and other massively overvalued investments and consumer items. 

 Just look at how, for example, the Dow has gone up **exponentially and parabolically** **in the last year in an historically unprecedented straight line.** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lnjdj8xvlg071.png?width=461&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a5b514632f262f311d158e14416251b98f6d00e

 

**US Federal Debt up 74X**  
**Total US debt up “only” 49X**  
**M2 Money Supply up 29X>**

**Debt to GDP 1971: 37% – 2021: 127%**

 Bubbles are called bubbles because they consist of air. And when bubbles become too big, they ALWAYS and without fail burst and implode. 

 Technically markets are giving very clear signals that THE END IS NIGH.

Whether that means days weeks or a few months, is totally irrelevant. We know that we are at the end of the most remarkable period in history in regards to money, investments and the economy.

 GOLD, SILVER AND WEALTH PRESERVATION

Gold  and Silver  have not at all reflected the massive creation of money in the last 50 years. That catchup phase is likely to start very soon based on both fundamentals and technicals. 

As regards securing your finances in periods of crisis, gold and silver have always been critical to hold.

 Everyone can afford some gold or silver. An ounce of silver is $28 and one gramme of gold is $50. So saving in precious metals will not only be very useful but essential at whatever level you can afford.

 The upside potential for gold and silver is multiples of the current prices and that is at today’s price levels. Higher inflation could take the metals to unfathomable heights.

Voclosporin, the first FDA-approved oral therapy for lupus nephritis, will be sold as Lupkynis by Aurinia Pharmaceuticals and is approved for use in conjunction with immunosuppressive treatment. And a quick Google search will verify rumors of a potential buyout by larger company.

Stonk is up 15% in the last two weeks, and 50% off 52 week high
Market cap is 1.6 billion
Only 128 million shares outstanding
44% currently owned by institutions
Short interest just under 7% of the float

Unlike most other stonks on WSB, This company actually becomes more profitable as it spends more money. Yes, I'm looking at you UWMC. If they continue at this rate, they will be profitable before end of year. Check their earnings.

Now please rip this deep dive to shreds in the comments below. If you agree with any of it I will assume you are a Wall Street douchebag.

TL/DR: first FDA approved therapy for lupus has room to double, and not many shares outstanding.

6701,,2021-05-21 12:45:14,t3_nhrmu8,,wallstreetbets,"FuboTV posted its Q1 results on the 11th. Seasonality in sports is obviously huge, with Q1 and Q2 being the worst periods of the season.

Consequently, there was always a sequential decline in the number of subscribers in Q1 and Q2 in 2019 and 2020. Typically between -8 and -9% sequentially. Given the amazing performance that was achieved in Q3 and Q4 last year, it was heavily expected that this Q1 would again see a decline in paid subscribers.

And then the results were published. For the first time in its history, Fubo delivered a sequential growth in paid subscribers and revenue in a Q1! The inflection point as been passed, the business momentum is stronger than the seasonality of sports. Looking ahead, with the Olympics, the soccer world cup qualifiers, the main leagues restarting everywhere, I expect massive growth in paid subscribers.

Now, onto the revenue side. The ARPU is approximately constant at around 69$/month since Q3 2020. The low seasonality of Q1 means that the relative share of ARPU due to the advertising is quite low compared to Q3 and Q4 last year. Which means that a great improvement of the subscription ARPU has been reached in Q1!

Now, when we'll go into Q3 and then Q4, with the absurd growth in number of subscribers and the massive gains from advertising, I'm expecting the ARPU to again grow. Expected advertising growth is 100% YOY.

And what happens when you combine massive subscribers and ARPU growth? You have massive results.

The cherries on the cake are:

1. Fubo betting which comes as a free version in Q3 and then paid version in Q4. It can be massive as Fubo will be the only player in the industry to control end to end the viewer/bettor experience.
2. International expansion, in Europe first probably, starting in 2022.
3. Accepting wagering in unconventional currencies.

I know, in the last week many talked about a possible future crash in the stock market, inflation and there is too much liquidity and bla bla bla. I am not here to say the next crash will occur this October or on any other date (I well know that correlation is not causation). I have no subtle purpose to share, it's just for the curiosity of this pattern.

p.s. Probably the cause is because October is my birthday.

I don't know if there is something to discuss this, but I would appreciate your opinions.

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes – well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you’ll double your money. This isn’t some wishy washy bullshit oh it’s going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it’s just a question of when. How can I be so sure? They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.

Should you trust me? Am I financial advisor – good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips. Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago? We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can’t lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist? What the fuck does that mean – fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill. Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn’t just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine – kind of a big deal. They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year. Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe – think FDA is going to delay?

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no. They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted. Added bonus – Pfizer’s big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also – or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain’t going cheap. They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner. Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn’t allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth. The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes – former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – not piece of shit pharma we have here. Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks. You don’t have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear. No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential? Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities – hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men’s lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself. Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant’s drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued. MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down - whatever could they do with that cash? $44 a share wouldn’t even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down. With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in – remember this isn’t some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them. And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can’t see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone. FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they’ve already approved in new indications like this one. Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point. It’s down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason. FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density – the solution: they will monitor bone density. That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on – doesn’t that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer. Even if they don’t Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs. Truly can’t fucking lose. so why is it trading so cheap?

It was Congressionally mandated in the last stimulus bill and gave the government 180 days to release an unclassified report to the general public and a classified report to congress. We are approaching that time, and June/July could be a heavy shift in perspectives and R&D priorities. [Sen. Rubio's Comments](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ufo-reports-should-be-taken-seriously-rubio-says-11621245038) [WaPo Article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/03/23/ufo-report-covid-bill/)

These UAP’s exhibit unexplainable flight characteristics: near instantaneous acceleration, airplane/submersible hybrid characteristics, visual disappearance, odd acoustics, etc. Also, multiple “types” of craft have been observed. 

There are patents filed by the Navy for inertial mass reduction craft (basically creating a quantum vacuum around the craft to avoid air/water resistance; useful to go Mach 16+ in the atmosphere). Here’s the patent: [Triangular UAP Patent?](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10144532B2/en). Additionally, we have heard rumors (and they may just be rumors) of anti-gravity temporal displacement craft. These craft can accelerate by utilizing gravity waves, bend light through a gravity well (stealthy), and externally perceived time could be affected as well (think Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar) ([Gravity Wave Patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10322827B2/) ) This UAP sightings might be manned craft or something else, or a mixture of both. These patents could also be counter-espionage missions to throw foreign countries off true technological breakthroughs, but we do know there was a demo of the tech: [Navy acknowledging demo, but not production ready](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/37134/emails-show-navys-ufo-patents-went-through-significant-internal-review-resulted-in-a-demo)

Okay great, so what’s the play…

**Long-Raytheon ($RTX)** has the Advanced Targeting Forward Look Infrared Sensor, which can be utilized to track UAP’s. This technology has been out for over a decade. Additionally, Raytheon is the go-to company for research into lasers, targeted radiation, or proton beams (still no word on proton torpedoes). ([UFO Targeting Pod](https://sofrep.com/news/following-pentagon-admission-raytheon-touts-gear-ufo-spotter/))

**Long-Lockheed Martin ($LMT)** a major defense aerospace firm, which developed many prototypes over the years and is famous for the Skunkworks R&D lab. Former Senator Harry Reid believes Lockheed has UAP fragments in their possession ([UAP Fragments](https://deadline.com/2021/04/ufo-fragments-in-possession-lockheed-martin-says-harry-reid-1234748095/)). These fragments are believed to be made of an unknown metal/alloy, and potentially 3D printed at an atomic level.

**Long-Northrup Grumman ($NOC)** is a defense giant which developed the B-2 stealth bomber and is a contractor on multiple space infrastructure missions. They would be vital for advanced composites/metallurgy, advanced avionics, spaceflight, and tracking systems.

Additionally, we have no clear knowledge of where the Chinese and Russians are at with this technology. Maybe this is partly why we founded Space Force? This is a \~2 month play to see if we can get more decisive acknowledgement of the technology whether it is manned or alien, either way it could make for an interesting news summer.",nht2ep,The Alien Trade

Can't believe I'm gonna throw shade on a firm I used to love but they have REALLY gone down hill.  Don't feel like writing a wall of text but want to warn others who are thinking of switching into them so I'm just going to bullet point problems I've had.  If you are with them already and feel so-so about them... there are better options out there.  Moving money is a pain in the ass but it might be worth it.

**Issues I've had with them**

* Margin approval is like pulling teeth.  They want to grill you to death for like half an hour and slowly increase your options approval one step at a time (honestly some of those guys seem like idiots and I'm not sure how they got their certifications).  If they don't like exactly how you answer questions even as an experienced trader that's been doing it for a while, they will delay your application by up to 6 months before you can try again.  That hasn't happened to me fortunately but apparently they do that so I'm always very anxious talking to them.  I have $600k ish with them in all my accounts and my risk per trade is typically capped at $50-60k.  I tend to have extra cash if I need to average down or add something to hedge my position.  Never used margin even though I have it since it's required to do a lot of different trades.

* Frequent outages (especially at market open), error messages, slow to load in the browser portal.  Desktop platform ""StreetSmart"" is terrible IMO but I suppose that is a matter of taste.  They're portal option trading is otherwise aright, I've seen better and worse but nothing to write home about.

* $1k recently mysteriously disappeared in my account.  They were quick to correct it and apparently it's some ""very rare"" programming error but who the fuck knows for sure.  I'm sure a lot of retards out there don't even notice if money is ever missing.

* Finally, something that has always bothered me is that their execution doesn't seem that good.  With options especially +/- a couple pennies (or nickel for larger contracts) can actually make a huge difference on your P&L for a trade.  They are THE LEADER in PFOF revenue.  Fuck them.


When I joined them close to 20 years ago, I worshiped Charles Schwab.  You can google him but he was Good Guy broker when no one cared about retail back in the day.

On the 1H candles, break out over 50ma, resistance at 200ma, rsi peaking at 70, propably will come down to get support from 50ma again before breaking over the 200ma.

The way I see it is there is no way that the price of SPCE will stay the same from today going into Monday. 

One of three options are going to play out.

1. Successful test flight
2. Test flight delayed, again 
3. Unsuccessful test flight

Regardless of the situation, the needle is going to move a LOT. How are you playing this rocket ride? 

I have a few 17p and 16p expiring Monday and a few HUGELY OTM calls expiring next Friday. I’m more expecting a total failure, but on the off chance it’s a huge success those calls are going to print.

What are y’all’s positions?

And to all the people saying you wouldn’t touch SPCE with a 40 foot pole, why? The stock is going to move one way or another and if you’re really that against it, buy puts and put your Twitter fingers to work.

6728,,2021-05-21 17:50:01,t3_nhyj2a,,wallstreetbets," **Before I talk Technical Analysis (TA), it is important to understand the following:**

Technical Analysis is absolute meaningless astrology unless the strategies and indicators used are statistically/quantitatively *proven to be meaningful*. There are a lot of articles being published (and even shared here) about TLRY's TA - ignore them. They have zero weight on Tilray's future. Most of these chart patterns, strategies, theories, ideas, etc. taught in traditional trading education come from early 1900's anecdotal theories, which were nothing more than early, primitive attempts to identify patterns in markets. But, this is a story and an explanation for another time.

**In-Depth MACD Explanation:**

Since it's a popular retail indicator, most of you probably already know what the Moving Average Converence/Divergence (MACD) is. However, it's usually not well understood. The MACD takes in three settings for Moving Averages (MA) and the two lines plotted on the indicator are calculated as so:

MACD Line: Short MA - Long MA

Signal Line: Signal MA of the MACD Line

This is actually an incredibly clever way of measuring momentum and trend-following. By taking the difference between two different MA periods, we get a second-derivative (i.e. acceleration). By default, the MACD is calculated an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and with period settings (12, 26, 9).

**So, onto TLRY's** ***potential*** **momentum shift:**

*Note that I said ""potential,"" because the land of quantitative/algorithmic trading is nothing more than a probability game developed through hypothesis testing.*

Today, TLRY experienced a MACD crossover with MACD settings (SMA, 28, 48, 32). Why these settings? Because I ran a statistical backtest on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and simulated over 140,000 settings in an attempt to find the best practical combination to signal price change over the next few days via MACD crossover (Fun fact: using a Simple Moving Average (SMA) *always* yields better results, no matter what symbol or asset class).

If I were to buy ever MACD (SMA, 28, 48, 32) crossover at the daily closing price and hold for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days, what would my results be? Here's the results for the SPY since 2003:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k8lmq168hi071.png?width=1885&format=png&auto=webp&s=1af5f7ce7e179b59a18a198aaab1447e6177afc8

Positive mean returns and a high win frequency are significant, with the 1st day after buying being the most important. So, now that we've seen it's general significance in large-cap, what are the backtested results for TLRY? Well, it's tough because Tilray hasn't had a publicly traded stock for very long, so the sample size is insufficiently small. But, take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/6d1lvnx9hi071.png?width=1932&format=png&auto=webp&s=24595178d1e6e808074bd46a7e8ad6a8442b3e98

It still holds some significance with the positive means and win frequencies. But obviously with only 9 crossovers happening in TLRY's lifetime, we can't take these numbers and fit them to any model.

**So, using the most statistically effective MACD period settings, TLRY** ***may*** **be getting a shift in momentum here fairly soon!**

I understand that my initial claims for the (28, 48, 32) settings were only tested on the SPY, and Tilray isn't large-cap growth. There is still more testing and solidifying to do. BUT, I figured you apes who are still holding are continually waiting for a confirmation bias, so here you go :)",nhyj2a,Tilray (TLRY) MACD Momentum Shift - Quantitative TA

Edit: nice close at 19$

You probably havent heard about [The Lion Electric Company](https://thelionelectric.com/). Its because its only been 2 weeks since they are officially listed on both [NYSE](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy5d2/nyselev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [TSX](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy67g/tsxlev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). Before that, you could only buy the SPAC's stock Northern Genesis Acquisition. This is when I first bought most of my shares.

Basic infos about the stock:
- currently worth 19 U$D (+30% this week and its the highest ever with ticker LEV)
- Market Cap 3,5 billion USD


What does the Lion do? They do 100% electric trucks and busses.
And yes there is a lot of competition in the EV market, but not that much for trucks. Lion doesnt make cars, only trucks. They also already have orders from Amazon and scholar institution. 


What makes me think LEV is a buy



1. Lion is going to open a manufacturing facility in Illinois worth about $500M. The Illinois government is financing $70M for this. When full operational, the factory will be able to produce 20,000 vehicles per year. It will be the biggest of its kind in the US. Lion says they plan they start production in mid-2022. 



2. Lion is also opening a battery factory in Quebec (Canada). The government is financing 100M CAD (roughly 82M USD) to help them build it. This means that not only Lion will make 100% electric trucks, they will also produce their own batteries which they could potentially sell to other businesses in the future. But most important is that they wont have to buy it from another. 



3. Quebec will no longer allow to sell new gasoline vehicles by 2035 (it doesnt concern used cars). This is in 15 years (only? Lol). But a lot of companies already started their transition to 100% EV. And all the state owned business will buy from a Canadian company, because thats how Canada works most of the time. All the school busses and normal busses have to be replaced, and we know they wont buy from a Chinese company when there is a Quebecker one available. So its probably going to be Lion Electric. You should also note that some private companies like Loblaws are already transitioning to EV, they bought a lot of Tesla trucks recently. However, Lion's trucks are not only local but also expected to be cheaper and good quality. 



4. Lion has clients
Amazon made a contract with Lion to buy 2,500 trucks over 5 years. But theres a downside: Lion is obliged to reserve 500 trucks per year for Amazon, while Amazon isnt obliged to actually buy them. It means that if the trucks quality is deceiptive, its possible Amazon would not buy them. This would of course be horrible for the stock.
But Amazon isnt the only big client: First Student bought 260 busses from Lion. It was announced this week, and I can still feel the +30% impact on my portfolio. Everyday LEV went higher than the previous one. 



5. LEV has a huge potential for long term profit. I personally think the stock could reach 25USD before the end of the year, but it could be even more. And when the Illinois facility will finally open, the stock should go higher than 30. If you look up the Northern Genesis stock history (the SPAC that merged with Lion 3 weeks ago), you will see the stock was at 30+ in January, but it fell with all the EV market. If you dont buy LEV this year, it might be too late. Of course the stock will be way higher in 5 years than now, but the more profit the better, right?



So in my opinion, you will make 100% to 300% within 3-4 years with this stock. But I am not an expert and you dont have to trust me. I trust myself and mostly trust The Lion Electric Company. I am already making small profit from this investment.


Have a good day and may your portfolio be green!",nhyn43,LEV: Lion Electric is the underdog

Now, there are two narratives if you are interested in buying SNDL stock. First is the bullish one that points to the ample cash on its balance sheet. SNDL is becoming like the Berkshire Hathaway of the marijuana industry. The company is investing and lending to several smaller marijuana companies. Also, it could expand into the U.S. adult-use market.


As for TLRY, it looks like a good marijuana company to buy from a business perspective. The company is a marijuana powerhouse with international operations and both medical and adult-use businesses. Also, count on the post-merger synergies and economies of scale to work for the new TLRY.



To sum it up, from a purely business perspective, you will bet on TLRY. However, if you are looking at betting on an investment vehicle that can capitalize on the troubles of some of the smaller marijuana companies, SNDL will fit the bill.",nhzt5b,"SNDL vs TLRY, comment your favorite"

* Industry consolidation is occurring due to shrinking margins and increased regulatory costs
   * Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act to encourage consumer lending

* Pandemic-driven demand sent total home sales to the highest since 2006

# Investment Thesis I: Established Leader in the Marketplace

LendingTree’s competitive advantages in the marketplace differentiate them from other loan or insurance comparison-shopping marketplaces.

* **Speed:** easy-use; apply for loans in minutes and lock-in rates
* **Convenience:** search and apply for quotes 24/7 from anywhere in the world
* **Competitive Rates:** average buyer saves $125-$163 per month for interest
   * LendingTree has saved refinanced borrowers the most in San Francisco, San Diego and Los Angeles with median savings of $80,211, $77,740 and $73,954 respectively
   * Even in cities with  refinancing savings like Detroit present median savings of $23,409

# Investment Thesis II: Insurance Growth

* The insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and the number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Refer to chart ‘Segment Revenue’
   * Insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Expected revenue growth of 30% + compared to 2Q2020
* Acquisitions of QuoteWizard in 4Q2018 and ValuePenguin in 1Q2019 allowed them to enhance their insurance products 
   * QuoteWizard – one of the largest insurance comparison marketplaces in the growing online insurance advertising market
      * This acquisition established LendingTree as a leading player in the online insurance advertising industry while also allowing them to diversify their financial services category
      * Significant portion of their revenue growth in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was driven by their insurance leads business from this acquisition 
   * ValuePenguin – personal finance website that offers consumers objective analysis on variety of financial topics from insurance to credit cards
      * This acquisition provided immense value to insurance carriers and agents through their high-quality content and SEO capability – allowing them further scale in the insurance space
* New Medicare category for insurance growth showed significant promise during their first open-enrollment period in the 4Q2020
   * Presents a significant opportunity for their insurance segment 

# Major Risks 

**Consumer Demand Risk –** a general increase in interest rates may affect the ability of LendingTree’s mortgage Network Partners to close loans which will translate to lower revenues for LendingTree and ultimately affect their financial position

**Interest Rate Risk –** The Federal Reserve is currently printing out more money in order to keep the markets afloat due to COVID-19. In the long-term, this will cause inflation and the decreasing value of the USD. To combat this, the Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates

# Final Thoughts

The positive industry outlook and the prospective insurance segment of LendingTree that has generated high growth YoY strengthen analysts’ recommendations to BUY. Given a stock price forecast projecting a median price target of $320 (60.7% upside) and a low-price target of $200 (0.5% upside), I believe this stock still has a low of room for growth as they continue to diversify its revenue streams and expanding their financial services. Furthermore, I’ve provided a chart of analyst recommendations retrieved from CNN Business that strengthens the recommendation to BUY.

# W-Shape Note:

* We needed to close above 418 for the w-shape to be confirmed. This didn't happen :(
* Maybe next week?

# BULLS v BEARS - Who's in control?

* Essentially been consolidating since 5/11 (even longer if you zoom out - about 4/6 ish range)
* Short term - we've made higher low but not a higher high. We've made a lower high.
* This highlights uncertainty IMO. (iNfLaTiOn AnYoNe?)
* **410 break is still the line in the sand IMO.**
* **415 and above and market favors bulls IMO.**
* **410 and below and marker favors bears IMO.**

# 1D Timeframe

* We've hit heavy resistance at the gap fill - two full days with resistance @ gap fill.
* **IMO. We see 420+ or 405- next week. A higher-high or a lower-low! But let's see!**

They are the first cards in a long time to have almost double the performance/price of its predecessor. Demand has been extreme, they sell out immediately when they're available and cost 3-4x retail in used markets. Even though their cards are the strongest ray tracing cards in the market, their stock price hasn't moved since they released.

In the short term, there is a worldwide silicon shortage. NVidia needs to at least fulfill enough demand to meet earnings expectations this quarter. Since AMD, which is outperformed in ray tracing, killed earnings, NVidia will meet earnings too.

In the long term, NVDA will have the red carpet for huge revenues from RTX 3000 sales as long as a superior line of GPUs doesn't release before the silicon shortage is dealt with. 

If NVDA fulfills the huge GPU demand in the future, then their price is very low right now.",ni8zp2,NVidia is a good buy right now

And people won't like the comment because they'll say but for the squeeze... But lots of them are upside down so of course they will say to keep buying and not diversify. That will help drive the price up for them more than you if they're upside down and you're not.

I hope the squeeze happens, I really do. But people need to be smart about it, not greedy and much less gambling.",,

Low PE long legacy companies with good books will be hit the least hard and start recovering faster if the drop did happen so I’m going to be piling it into those. 

I see things being choppy but holding on this path now until fall, the main concern I have personally is that we’ve exhausted all our options if another catalyst causes it to go down like COVID did. Can’t lower rates again that would not be met well by anyone, can’t stimulate the economy and beef up social welfare programs to get money into business and the market because then we would have major inflation problems. It’s just one thing away from really feeling like 08/09 again where we did too much to prop it up and ran out of things to do when a catalyst came along.

This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let’s go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don’t need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there’s a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

Overall, I’m bullish and have over 30 call contracts expiring this July 🚀🚀🚀",nhdnzi,Bull Cruise $CCL primed to explode 🚀🚀📈🚀

UWMC has had a better post-earnings period not because their top line YOY growth was so good or even indicative of something remotely possible to sustain moving forward, but really just because of the dividend and chest pounding against RKT.

I have a position in both, and before either camp starts screaming about how one is more revolutionary, or has better blah blah blah, realize that the only thing driving price action for either is public sentiment. UWMC declared a regular dividend while RKT only a special.

It might be to their advantage to do so because they are able to profit off of the availability of COMEX -- but at what price?  
In other words, saving COMEX yet again may be becoming just too *expensive* for JPM's bean counters/risk managers.  
Or maybe they simply don't have the available unencumbered silver to do this with any longer.  
JPM and their billion ounce mountain of silver may be a paper tiger. 

&#x200B;

Lets dign in !

**Comex silver warehouse .... another 1,000,000 oz is OUT OF THE VAULT, 43,000,000 oz is gone since the silverbacks arrived. This time it is all HSBC bank. And what did big powerful JP Morgan do? Nothing!! Maybe all their silver eligible is spoken for.** 

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

W-shape with today's price action.

* For the w-shape to hold true we need to push over 418.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418.
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there’s at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don’t have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

Inflation is gonna destroy non-asset holders. I’m a bit worried about discount retail (5 below, DG, Dollar Tree) holding up because the business models are predicated on selling commodities at a certain price point. If commodity prices skyrocket dollar tree especially is gonna have a tough time adjusting since literally everything in their store is a dollar. So I think the better bet is to buy the actual companies that create goods that the poor are capable of buying (since inflation will eradicate much of the middle class.) Vizio products would never be sold in one of these stores but they sell really cheap TVs with internet accessibility. They sell a really good product considering the price point. I check their books and it’s a profitable company that’s been improving margins that last two years. Pretty low market cap so I wouldn’t be shocked if a larger company sought to buy it in the future.

7526,gz0nuyd,2021-05-22 03:08:00,t1_gz0nuyd,t3_ni4vcu,wallstreetbets,">IMO. We see 420+ or 405- next week. A higher-high or a lower-low! But let's see!

Is this your DD? We have already seen $420+ on the 1st week of this month and $405- during the 2nd week. Next week has 5 trading days and considering todays closing price of $515, it's a 1.02% uptrend to cross $420 or 2.41% downtrend. A fluctuation of 1-2.5% in 5 trading days is very normal for SPY and you do not need to eat crayon to say that.

You say W shape? There is no W shape in that chart. If you forcefully try to make a flat line between 14th, 17th and 18th to a point, it doesn't become a point!

>Current support at 60 SMMA   
>  
>Current resistance at 20 SMMA

This is idiotic at best. Do you even understand what a moving average filter is? The resulting value is moving along time. How can a moving point be either support or resistance? 

You say if the SP is above X price it's bullish and if it's below Y price it's bearish. There are bull call support and bear put support bla bla bla. Did you looks at the OI and volume of SPY contracts for the last month? It has always been on the bearish side yet SPY move upward. 

Give it up TA does not work. Do not get confused and make other's confused trying to be smarter. Instead of saying SPY can vary 2.5% in next 5 trading days clearly say what will be the price on Monday at open, at midday and at close. If you can't say that that admit TA doesn't work.",,

While the media picks up on US Legalization, Tilray is slowly trying to take over Europe. 

As we know, on May 3rd, 2021, Tilray & Aphria Announce Closing of Transaction That Creates the [“New”](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210503005294/en/Tilray-Aphria-Announce-Closing-of-Transaction-That-Creates-the-%E2%80%9CNew%E2%80%9D-Tilray-%E2%80%93-a-Global-Cannabis-Leader)Tilray – a Global Cannabis Leader

Rewind a bit..

On January 27th, 2021 the CFO of ~~Aphria~~ Tilray, Carl Merton did an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCannalysts/comments/l2wxoa/aphria_inc_ama_january_27_2021/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) in which he highlights the challenges Aphria/Tilray face in creating desired synergies.

>More importantly and something I think too many people fail to completely comprehend; **we bring a distribution system to Tilray in Europe**. Currently, Tilray pays a third party to distribute their product in Europe. That means they are only recording the sale of cannabis from the producer to the distributor and are incurring a cost to do it. By running the Tilray sale through **CC Pharma**, not only do we remove the distribution expense from Tilray’s operations, but the combined entity will now record the sale from the distributor to the pharmacy, effectively moving up market in our share of wallet with the consumer.

**Who is CC Pharma?**

CC Pharma is based in Densborn, Germany and is one of the leading national distributors of pharmaceutical products to pharmacists in Germany, with over 13,000 pharmacies in its sales network that was [acquired](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aphria-completes-acquisition-of-cc-pharma-leading-german-pharmaceutical-and-medical-cannabis-distributor-300775086.html) by Aphria in 2019. 

On Jan. 26th 2021, CC Pharma [inked a deal](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/amp-german-cannabis-group-and-aphria-s-subsidiary-cc-pharma-gmbh-enter-into-strategic-co-promotion-agreement-for-the-sale-of-medical-cannabis-in-germany-897696119.html) with AMP German Cannabis Group:

>AMP will organize with the support of CC Pharma, ""information events"" in Germany to market Aphria branded products to doctors and pharmacists; Dr. Stefan Feuerstein, Director and President of AMP, commented, ""We are proud to partner with Aphria and CC Pharma GmbH. Our sole focus is to sell medical cannabis in Germany, which makes us an ideal partner to co-promote and sell the Aphria brand.

In Feburary, [Materia Deutschland](https://www.materia.global/press/materia-announces-strategic-portfolio-expansion/) entered into a commercial supply agreement with CC Pharma to distribute its high quality, Aphria-branded flower products across Materia Deutschland’s  pharmacy network throughout Germany. Under the terms of this agreement, CC Pharma will import and batch release the products, with Materia Deutschland taking responsibility for pharmacy sales and fulfillment.

>The addition of Aphria flower and dronabinol will bolster Materia Deutschland’s offering to customers and accelerate its growth potential in the German market. Materia has already commenced sales of dronabinol, while sales of Aphria-branded products to pharmacies will begin in the coming weeks.

**Tilray & France**

The same day Aphria & CC Pharma gobble up market share in Germany, Tilray was selected by French National Agency to Supply GMP-Certified Medical Cannabis Products in [France](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210126005149/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Selected-by-French-National-Agency-to-Supply-GMP-Certified-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-France) 

>it has been selected by the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) to supply Good Manufacturing Processes (GMP) certified medical cannabis products for experimentation in France. Tilray will supply GMP-produced medical cannabis products to serve patients in need for the duration of the French experiment (18-24 months), due to begin in the first quarter of 2021.

The cannabis will be exported to France from Tilray's facility in [Portugal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210201005184/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Receives-the-First-and-Only-Market-Authorization-to-Offer-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-Portugal) 

>In May 2020, Tilray received its third and complete Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certification for Tilray Portugal. The complete GMP-certification allows Tilray to manufacture medical cannabis extracts in-house and export GMP-produced finished medical cannabis products, both dried flower, and oil, from Portugal throughout the European Union and other international markets with authorized national medical cannabis programs.

More recently, on May 13th 2021, Tilray annouced the closing of the Enniskillen medical cannabis facility:

>Tilray said as it merges operations with Leamington-based Aphira Inc., the company is **“making changes to optimize operational efficiencies.”** The company said it will concentrate local cultivation in Leamington, and local manufacturing in its nearby facility in [London](https://blackburnnews.com/sarnia/sarnia-news/2021/05/13/tilray-closing-enniskillen-medical-cannabis-facility/)

It is clear that the ‘new’ Tilray is prepping for aggressive European expansion. The amount of untapped growth potential in Europe is eyeopening & Tilray will be first is line to benefit. I highly recommend doing your own DD and deepdiving the management. Irwin Simon moves quickly and has a great track record. I believe this company is poised for significant growth via European operations.

[Outlook post from last night.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ngglg9/i_spy_519_recap_and_520_outlook/)

[outlook post from last night](https://preview.redd.it/3jqflwh9qc071.png?width=2468&format=png&auto=webp&s=e36443442cb090f0598fe727d8911f80fc3be7d0)

W-shape with today's price action.

* For the w-shape to hold true we need to push over 418.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418.
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

1D RSI

* RSI at 53ish (>50 = bullish)

However I was deep thinking, so I started digging.  We never recovered from the 08 crisis.  They just dropped interest rates and turned on the printer.  

Now in 11-12 I was a security guard for a company that made coins for the us mint/ tiff jewelry.  Gold was crazy 16-1700$ an once.  It’s gone up 150-200$ an oz in the decade where we printed more money than we have since our founding. 

What if the government knew they were fucked and told hedge funds to naked short everything till oblivion. 


Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there’s at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don’t have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.  

Apes look up academic papers from the 08 collapse and what’s going on now naked shorting is on the rise.  

It’s nuts

And that's all to assume if they did release a new stack it'd be competitive. They haven't really been competitive on the GPU scene for a couple of generations. It likely wouldn't change suddenly now.

Thankfully, NVidia is seemingly shoving their had as far up their own ass as they can manage, so maybe the goal is that NVidia fails harder than AMD.",,

a 50-day, 100-day, 200-day, MA act as a support

Open your tool and then open 1 year SPY chart then plot 50-day, 100-day and 200-day MA and tell me what you see. Let me tell you what you will see-

200-day MA is never being touched in last 9 months

 100-day MA was touched twice and it dipped below that line once out of two times which means 50% probability.

50-day MA was touched 7 times and dipped below that line 3 times which means 42.8% times it did not bounced.

Now open the AMZN and do all over again. What you see? It almost never works. Instead of sharing that investopedia link if you could try to understand what a moving average is you would know why SP is above that line in a uptrend or below that line in a downtrend. It's not due to how stock market works, neither it's some TA magic. It's the definition of moving average itself. 

Look at other tickers as well you will see that claim fails miserably most times. Sometimes it might align with your claim but that's not due to some TA magic rather the nature of random number. You know coin flip!

I traded it during the initial big rush. I did not buy and hold. I didn't take it as a personal or emotional thing. I liked that retail traders stuck it to hedge funds. They didn't expect it. 

I did daily swing trades with GME and AMC, exploiting a clear pattern I saw in how it traded. 

Once the pattern didn't work, I sold off and didn't get involved in it again. 

I made a good amount of money thanks to the mania. 

The idea that hedge funds are still in a bad position in these stocks is nonsense. 

They got caught out once, learned and have shifted their approach to siphon off money from retail traders and other institutional traders.

These are MASSIVE institutions with the best and the brightest working for them. They can trade off market. They have computers trading for them.

The idea that they've just been getting hammered because of retail traders is silly. So is the amount of power retail traders think they have. They make up a tiny amount of the market relative to institutions.

Hedge funds own GME stock and they own short positions. They make money when it goes up and make money when it goes down.

Right now, all my positions (with a few exceptions) are based on the stock market crash which I believe 100% is on its way. I just don't know when exactly. Could be Monday, could be two years from now - but it's coming.

I saw the dip coming last week. I saw the one earlier in the year. I made money on both. I hope to make money on the next one.

Given that crypto just tanked today, it's likely the stock market is about to do the same. If you look at the charts for BTC and NDX, they are totally correlated lately.",,

* Filled gap convincely.
* Hit resistance 🎯 but not bullish 🎯s. Reached high of 416.63 or 0.18 from first bullish pt from this mornings read.
* Spiked @ 86 ish on RSI and ended the day @ 52 ish (Bullish). 15 min. timeframe.

W-shape with today's price action.

* For the w-shape to hold true we need to push over 418.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418.
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

However I was deep thinking, so I started digging.  We never recovered from the 08 crisis.  They just dropped interest rates and turned on the printer.  

Now in 11-12 I was a security guard for a company that made coins for the us mint/ tiff jewelry.  Gold was crazy 16-1700$ an once.  It’s gone up 150-200$ an oz in the decade where we printed more money than we have since our founding. 

What if the government knew they were fucked and told hedge funds to naked short everything till oblivion. 


Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there’s at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don’t have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.  

Apes look up academic papers from the 08 collapse and what’s going on now naked shorting is on the rise.  

It’s nuts

From Youtube: ""YouTube’s right to monetize: YouTube has the right to monetize all content on the platform and ads may appear on videos from channels not in the YouTube Partner Program.""

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

TLDR; BIGC good, like SHOP, but undervalued.

Inflation is gonna destroy non-asset holders. I’m a bit worried about discount retail (5 below, DG, Dollar Tree) holding up because the business models are predicated on selling commodities at a certain price point. If commodity prices skyrocket dollar tree especially is gonna have a tough time adjusting since literally everything in their store is a dollar. So I think the better bet is to buy the actual companies that create goods that the poor are capable of buying (since inflation will eradicate much of the middle class.) Vizio products would never be sold in one of these stores but they sell really cheap TVs with internet accessibility. They sell a really good product considering the price point. I check their books and it’s a profitable company that’s been improving margins that last two years. Pretty low market cap so I wouldn’t be shocked if a larger company sought to buy it in the future.

The cost is factored in, private contracts are a factor, and again overbought. Look at Dvita, each year there’s more and more patients for dialysis with an ever growing boomer population, they use outdated machines, have poor support, etc. looks at a pharma company like the opioid one, again, the reason really comes down towards the profit being reinvested into lobbying and not investors. Coinbase went public and crypto crashes twice in the first 30 days, despite all time highs.

I wrote that post on May 8 and CEO sold share on May, May 6, May 4, April 21, April 20, April 19, April 08, April 07, April 06 and continuing...... each time over 600K to 1.3M shares. After I wrote that post he sold only 499 shares on 13th!

On May 8, PLTR was between $18.18-$19.30 and todays closing price was $20.75.

My whole writing was based on heavy selling by CEO which apparently looks like stopped or slowed down significantly.

8698,,2021-05-22 04:16:24,t3_niahr7,,wallstreetbets,"Hello apes! Just read Chapter 8 of The Intelligent Investor which briefly talks about the distinction between ""market timing"" and ""pricing,"" and it was a bit of a holy shit moment.

Graham describes market timing as essentially buying stocks because you think the market is on its way up, and pricing as buying stocks because you think they are undervalued based on your own assessment of what they're actually worth, without any theory of what the market is going to do in the short term.

They're both two sides of the same coin obviously - in both cases you're basically betting on a stock because you think it's going to go up, but the difference between the two is crucial.

When you're timing the market you worry about what other people think about the stock. You create all sorts of narratives about why the market is down and why it's going to go up. If someone is trying to time the market and a stock goes down 30% after they buy it, they think, ""holy shit I made a mistake,"" potentially sell, and all sorts of bad things happen. Graham equates market timing to speculation, with the results of market timers being the same as most speculators (i.e. not good).

When someone is pricing, they don't worry too much about why the market is pricing a stock where it is. They just accept that the market can be irrational and misprice stocks sometimes, and for whatever reason this is one of those times. They also don't care about short term market fluctuations - they don't buy a stock because they think it's going to go up in any specific time frame, just because they think it's undervalued now, and they know that in the long term the market should bring the stock to its true value. If a stock goes down 30% after they buy it they don't panic, and if anything look at it as an opportunity to buy more. As long as you've got time to wait, Graham believes pricing is the fundamentally better approach.

When reading the above, I think we all like to think we're pricers, not market timers. In practice, though, human nature being what it is, we're probably a lot closer to market timers than we'd like to admit.

The core thing about this distinction in my view is that to be successful pricing you not only have to actually be right in your analysis of the true value of a stock, you also need have the conviction to stick by your belief that your value of the stock is right and the market's is wrong, even for long periods and in the face of huge potential losses. Having this conviction is not a question of your brain's computing power, but your temperament/emotional control, almost like the difference between intelligence and wisdom.

It sounds easy on paper, but it's one of those things that's a lot harder to do in practice. The boom and bust history of the stock market for the past 150 years is proof that most people can't or don't do it.

In any event, I have no actual point to this post, I just thought it was a really good insight. Go read his book!",niahr7,Market Timing vs Pricing

However I was deep thinking, so I started digging.  We never recovered from the 08 crisis.  They just dropped interest rates and turned on the printer.  

Now in 11-12 I was a security guard for a company that made coins for the us mint/ tiff jewelry.  Gold was crazy 16-1700$ an once.  It’s gone up 150-200$ an oz in the decade where we printed more money than we have since our founding. 

What if the government knew they were fucked and told hedge funds to naked short everything till oblivion. 


Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there’s at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don’t have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.  

Apes look up academic papers from the 08 collapse and what’s going on now naked shorting is on the rise.  

It’s nuts

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

1- People buy because the hype and not because they like the company and the fundamentals. And when a bad or fake new comes they lose the faith and sell losing money.
2- I know that coordinate buys can be consider market manipulation, but short sellers have been doing it and maybe apes should do it in a way nobody get caught. Until now every ape bought anytime and many times it was not effective at all. Apes need a plan.
3- Apes try to Squeeze too many stocks at the same time. AMC, GME again...and many others. I remember that some apes were throwing shit on clover because they were trying to Squeeze another one. Apes don't have enough money and press power to Squeeze 5 or 10 companies at the same time.
This said...I am a long term investor and I just have clover stocks, not AMC, GME... And I don't have more money to invest. I am invested 100% and clover is just 4% of my portfolio.
But I like WSB movement and want to help with some ideas.
In my opinion, WSB should basically:
1- Find someone who can coordinate the timing and the target.  (Find a Cesar, like in the movie, apes strong together).
2- Coordinate the % of the shares that each ape is going to buy and distribute it on time to be effective on the price and the final profit. For example. Every ape buy now 20% of the total invest under 7 in the next 2 weeks. After this, push the price strategically to 8 or 9 with 30% of every ape investment and hold the like with 10% more. Finally use the other 40% in the final attack when a great new happen to clover (SEC clear the investigation, Biden down to 60 Medicare age...)(clover is just an example, can apply to any other stock trying to be Squeeze).
3- Chose just 1 target per time. When you get the Squeeze, sell every ape 5% a day to avoid some apes got trapped holding the bag. And with all the profits, when you finish one Squeeze start the next one with the extra funds. It will make a snowball effect and every Squeeze will be easier than the last one if you chose well due to bigger money amount to push.
I think with this method you could get to Squeeze any company with more than 30% SI and a market cap under 10B.
I am not going to participate in all this, I just will hold my clover stocks until they got 70 or 80 dollars, but if you like the idea spread it.",,

However I was deep thinking, so I started digging.  We never recovered from the 08 crisis.  They just dropped interest rates and turned on the printer.  

Now in 11-12 I was a security guard for a company that made coins for the us mint/ tiff jewelry.  Gold was crazy 16-1700$ an once.  It’s gone up 150-200$ an oz in the decade where we printed more money than we have since our founding. 

What if the government knew they were fucked and told hedge funds to naked short everything till oblivion. 


Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there’s at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don’t have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.  

Apes look up academic papers from the 08 collapse and what’s going on now naked shorting is on the rise.  

It’s nuts

From Youtube: ""YouTube’s right to monetize: YouTube has the right to monetize all content on the platform and ads may appear on videos from channels not in the YouTube Partner Program.""

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

TLDR; BIGC good, like SHOP, but undervalued.

Inflation is gonna destroy non-asset holders. I’m a bit worried about discount retail (5 below, DG, Dollar Tree) holding up because the business models are predicated on selling commodities at a certain price point. If commodity prices skyrocket dollar tree especially is gonna have a tough time adjusting since literally everything in their store is a dollar. So I think the better bet is to buy the actual companies that create goods that the poor are capable of buying (since inflation will eradicate much of the middle class.) Vizio products would never be sold in one of these stores but they sell really cheap TVs with internet accessibility. They sell a really good product considering the price point. I check their books and it’s a profitable company that’s been improving margins that last two years. Pretty low market cap so I wouldn’t be shocked if a larger company sought to buy it in the future.

9345,,2021-05-21 07:40:32,t3_nhmv7n,,wallstreetbets,"Ford is great value investment considering it will compete with TESLA for EV market - Most of bear case is ford debt and they are 100% wrong. Please read below article.

**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    
**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford’s finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford’s automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford’s $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford’s $160 billion debt load.

From old post:

1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

9347,,2021-05-21 09:36:45,t3_nhoi3w,,wallstreetbets,"Virgin Galactic announced they have a test flight scheduled for tomorrow and the stock moved up by 14% yesterday. I’m overall bearish on this company, as founder Richard Branson and SPAC-backer Chamath Palihapitiya have both sold basically all of their shares. Cathie Woods doesn’t even own it for ARK. 

I want to buy puts in anticipation of a drop Monday, this seems like the most likely outcome to me. Whether the launch is a failure or people just sell the news after a big move, it seems unlikely that it continues to rally Monday. There’s a lot of bag holders who bought at $40-60 a couple months ago that would love to get out if it bounces which would theoretically limit its possible gains Monday. On the chance the test flight greatly exceeds expectations or there is another announcement included along side the test, the stock could fly however. I feel that this is a slim but non-zero possibility. Basically whichever way it moves, it’s going to move hard. June 4th options have an IV of 165% per thinkorswim. 

My question is whether I am better off buying straight puts on $SPCE or if I should buy some sort of call/put spread to hedge my downside in the event the stock continues to fly Monday. My main concern is making the right move and still getting IV crushed. I’m looking at 6/4/21 $20 puts, or a spread at the same strike and expiry. In your opinions, is that a smart move or is there something else I should be considering? I’m still relatively new to trading options. 

Thanks for your input!

However I was deep thinking, so I started digging.  We never recovered from the 08 crisis.  They just dropped interest rates and turned on the printer.  

Now in 11-12 I was a security guard for a company that made coins for the us mint/ tiff jewelry.  Gold was crazy 16-1700$ an once.  It’s gone up 150-200$ an oz in the decade where we printed more money than we have since our founding. 

What if the government knew they were fucked and told hedge funds to naked short everything till oblivion. 


Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there’s at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don’t have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.  

Apes look up academic papers from the 08 collapse and what’s going on now naked shorting is on the rise.  

It’s nuts

It’s pretty late and my windows rolled down, I hear the gate of the courts open behind my car. 

I was shocked frozen, with it being that late, not thinking someone would be there chilling too. But then someone in a creepy ass fucking voice I swear coming from behind like it was super close said “Hey” in this raspy ass creepy voice.

I’m a dumbass for having all my windows rolled the fuck down cuz I’m surprised the fucker didn’t jump in and try something.

I doubt it was some stupid kids trying to mess around, they generally stop hanging around 9/10 PM tops. 

Super sketch and time to only keep blazing at my plan B.) spot going forward👍🏼",,

However I was deep thinking, so I started digging.  We never recovered from the 08 crisis.  They just dropped interest rates and turned on the printer.  

Now in 11-12 I was a security guard for a company that made coins for the us mint/ tiff jewelry.  Gold was crazy 16-1700$ an once.  It’s gone up 150-200$ an oz in the decade where we printed more money than we have since our founding. 

What if the government knew they were fucked and told hedge funds to naked short everything till oblivion. 


Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there’s at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don’t have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.  

Apes look up academic papers from the 08 collapse and what’s going on now naked shorting is on the rise.  

It’s nuts

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

TLDR; BIGC good, like SHOP, but undervalued.

Inflation is gonna destroy non-asset holders. I’m a bit worried about discount retail (5 below, DG, Dollar Tree) holding up because the business models are predicated on selling commodities at a certain price point. If commodity prices skyrocket dollar tree especially is gonna have a tough time adjusting since literally everything in their store is a dollar. So I think the better bet is to buy the actual companies that create goods that the poor are capable of buying (since inflation will eradicate much of the middle class.) Vizio products would never be sold in one of these stores but they sell really cheap TVs with internet accessibility. They sell a really good product considering the price point. I check their books and it’s a profitable company that’s been improving margins that last two years. Pretty low market cap so I wouldn’t be shocked if a larger company sought to buy it in the future.
