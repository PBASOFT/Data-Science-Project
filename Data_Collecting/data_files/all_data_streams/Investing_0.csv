2,2021-05-09 14:48:18,t3_n8fpef,n8fpef,investing,"So I was reading up about how the Fed can attempt to influence credit availability and long term interest rates by controlling what is used to calculate the SLR (as they did last year 1st April).

My understanding that the SLR requirements are put in place to ensure banks have enough capital with respect to their risky assets such that if they lose the assets (eg people defaulting on loans and mortgages as they did in 2007/8), they have sufficient capital to cover those potential losses such that they will not go under.

However, I have trouble understanding **why** certain things are included in the calculation, and some not. My google search has mostly been futile as the same findings are repeated about what is the SLR, what goes into its calculations. I want to understand **why** it is the case.

So to start off, the definition of the SLR =  Tier 1 Capital / Total Leverage Exposure .

1. Tier 1 Capital includes ""Common Equity Tier 1"" and ""Additional Tier 1 Capital"".
2. Total Leverage Exposure refers to ""Both on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet assets exposures"". Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think of it as assets that have a **risk of declining in value** (eg derivatives, loans, etc).

For 1, my main trouble is understanding ""Common Equity Tier 1"", which investopedia says it ""comprises a bank’s **core capital** and includes **common shares**, stock surpluses resulting from the issue of common shares, retained earnings, common shares issued by subsidiaries and held by third parties, and accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI).""

* To me, when I think of a bank's core capital, the first thing that pops into my mind would be the actual amount of cash they have (minus deposits since deposits are not factored in to the SLR anyways). But clearly I'm missing something here because cash is nowhere to be seen. I was thinking that that it is better expressed in the form of retained earnings, because that would have accounted for any expenses and liabilities.
* Another thing is the bank's own common shares being considered core capital. While I understand, if banks need to take losses on assets and continue operations, they can fall back on their retained earnings, which in a way helps buffer the losses since all these earnings are the net income accumulated over the years of operation. But can banks use their own shares for this purpose? Essentially, the question is, how can **banks use their own shares to protect themselves from asset loss**? How do shares play that role? Honestly I think I'm carrying one big misunderstanding somewhere, and hope someone can shed some light into it.

Now, for 2, the Fed introduced a temporary change on 1st April 2020 (and which has since expired) where ""the change would exclude **U.S. Treasury securities** and **deposits at Federal Reserve Banks** from the calculation of the rule "". This effectively lowers the denominator for the banks, increasing their SLR and giving them more leeway to **lend out their capital (cash), providing credit for the economy**, and also allows them to **park more of their (non-productive) cash into US treasury bonds (which give interest), thus lowering bond yields**, helping the Fed control long term interest rates. These two outcomes, as per my understanding, was why the Fed allowed this change in light of the Covid shock to markets and the economy.

* I can understand and accept that US treasury securities, although almost considered to be risk-free, are still debt assets (which are inherently risky), and hence included into the equation in which banks have to hold a certain amount of capital against. What I don't understand is why deposits at the Federal Reserve Banks are included. My understanding is that banks, instead of keeping excess reserves/deposits with themselves, they can deposit them with the Fed and get a small interest on it (better than nothing). But why is this considered into the equation? Will these assets (deposits at the Fed) **have a risk of being lost if the Fed is somehow unable to return them**?? If yes, what situation will it be where the Fed cannot return the deposits? If no, why is it part of the SLR equation, and why is there a need to hold capital against it?
* When the expiry was drawing near, and as banks were lobbying the Fed to extend this SLR change, one of the reasons I saw was that banks would have to ""decrease deposits (pushing savers out of holding deposits)"", essentially meaning turning away people who want to deposit money with the bank. **Why would reverting the change mean that banks have to turn away deposits?**
* After the expiry of the change, the fear that banks would now have to sell treasury bonds to meet SLR requirements (and cause a rise in yields that would hamper economic recovery) did not materialize. Instead, it was reported that banks were raising cash by issuing debt. This would imply that this increases their core capital. Why is this possible when cash is not included in the definition of core capital? After all, this also has a net neutral effect on their balance sheet, since the increase in cash will be offset by an increase in liabilities to their creditors.

As one can see from my myriad of questions, I'm definitely no banker or accountant or whatever, in fact just a barely 20 y/o kid trying to learn more about the financial world. My understanding towards the SLR is probably ridden with misunderstanding and would really appreciate if people, or actual bankers over here, can help me clear it up.",Understanding the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR),,

A bit of context here: I’m a chartered accountant working in senior management at a real estate developer. I have experience in valuations across most asset classes (stocks / real estate / business valuations etc). 

This is the first time I have ever seen every single asset class so substantially inflated: stocks, real estate, crypto currency. Whatever it is, every asset class is at all time highs. We all know the reasons why this is the case: excessive money printing & all time low interest rates have created a yield hungry environment with inflated asset prices. 

I don’t want to waste time talking about why this is the case, but I would like to know, what are you doing to protect yourself against the eventual correction in asset prices? 

Quite honestly, I’m not sure what to do here. You either hold money in cash and risk missing out on further price appreciation, or you are fully invested and exposed to asset price corrections.  Thoughts?",Asset valuations - how are you protecting yourself?,,
4,2021-05-09 16:21:06,t3_n8hkut,n8hkut,investing," Ray Dalio, the master of the LinkedIn essay and co-CIO of a minor hedge fund, is the subject of the next installment of investing styles. Ray’s All-Weather Fund is a risk-parity approach to investing, an approach that aims to diversify equal risk amongst a set of assets that have minimal or negative correlation in the event of rising or falling growth and inflation across the world economy.

The set of assets in Ray’s approach is wider than most individual investors consider: Emerging Market Credit, Corporate Credit, and Commodities, in addition to equities and bonds. Ray’s selection of assets in his risk-parity fund was driven by his belief that there are 2 core environmental drivers of markets - growth and inflation. Different assets in the portfolio perform under the 4 possible combinations of rising or falling growth and rising or falling inflation. Rather than allocating solely to assets that perform well over a falling inflation/falling growth regime, he spread the allocation over assets that perform under each of the four possible regimes. Helpful grid of the assets that perform in each regime here: [https://imgur.com/HnQ3Qp0](https://imgur.com/HnQ3Qp0). Since the market is forward-looking, what matters for classifying the regime is not just the direction of growth and inflation, but whether or not the direction is already expected, and thus priced into the market. You want to have assets that are durable when inflation or growth surprises to the upside/downside. 

Now for the controversial element of risk-parity: leverage. Rather than allocating an equal dollar amount to each of the assets outlined above, the allocation strategy is to employ leverage on lower volatility assets to achieve higher mean return at the cost of higher volatility and of the interest rate of the borrowed dollars used to lever. For example, if you have an asset with a 2% historical mean return and 5% historical volatility then you could achieve a higher expected mean return by leveraging the asset 2x to increase the expected mean return to 4% while expected volatility is now 10%. Additionally, you should expect to pay some interest rate on the margin used to implement the leverage.

The decision of how much to lever is usually set by targeting a total portfolio volatility and then giving each asset in the portfolio an equal volatility budget. If it’s a lower volatility asset, for example TIPS or investment grade corporate bonds, then the leverage ratio is higher. But for a volatile asset like equities there may be no leverage at all since the existing asset volatility already meets the volatility budget.

It isn’t intuitive how in theory applying leverage in this way can actually decrease portfolio volatility over time so it’s helpful to compare a 60/40 equities bond portfolio against the risk-parity allocation to equities and bonds. In the 60/40 portfolio the total portfolio volatility is dominated by the equity component. In the risk-parity portfolio the same mean-return as the 60/40 portfolio could be achieved with lower volatility by allocating less to equities and more to bonds and applying leverage. If you are a nerd and interested in more theory about portfolio allocation strategies under risk parity I recommend this AQR overview: [https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/White-Papers/Understanding-Risk-Parity](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/White-Papers/Understanding-Risk-Parity) 

So how does Ray think the average Joe should invest using this risk-parity theory jumbo? Well, he did an interview with Tony Robbins in 2015 suggesting a 55% allocation to US bonds but every recent interview is about cash being trash, US bonds being dumb and investing in Asia. If you happened to have a couple billion dollars you could directly invest in his hedge fund but for us poors we’re stuck with mutual funds and ETFs. The central idea of risk-parity can be applied in your own portfolio by diversifying among assets that will perform well in different regimes. If your portfolio doesn’t have any assets that perform well under a rising inflation/rising growth regime then consider looking into commodity ETFs and inflation-linked bonds.  


The choice to use leverage as a retail investor is harder to recommend than the ideas around diversification. The theory of leveraging lower volatility assets in order to achieve higher return makes sense but there are downsides. One is that retail investors will pay higher costs to use leverage, either in high-fees for leveraged ETFs or in higher margin fees than institutions. The other, perhaps more relevant, risk for retail is failure to manage the risk of leveraged assets well. There must be rebalancing between assets to maintain the risk budgets of each asset and if the correlations of assets within the portfolio change then the fundamental assumption of assets performing under different regimes can be violated and leverage ratios should be managed accordingly. Another option is to trust a mutual fund or robo-advisor to manage this risk-parity approach for you, but as noted above the implementation matters and the fee drag of expensive risk-parity products should be considered.  


Hopefully you can take some ideas about allocating risk across your portfolio, considering other asset classes, and the performance of your portfolio under different market regimes into your own investing style. Next time, I will cover Christopher Cole’s long term investing style which aims to protect against the tail events that even risk-parity funds do not handle well.

6,2021-05-09 21:04:56,t3_n8nkcd,n8nkcd,investing,"Traditionally, real estate was always seen as one of the best kinds of investment, but imo that's largely because knowledge on stocks was much more rare, and it wasn't as easy back then, since there weren't many investing apps, higher fees, and it wasn't as easy to do. 

While there are of course still challenges and risks, there seems to be countless reasons today why stocks are now much easier and better, and barely any reasons to invest in real estate, given how expensive real estate has become right now, and this is coming from someone who's followed investing for several years now, seen multiple crashes, as well as bull markets as well.  

With stocks 

1. The barrier to entry is much less, you just need an app or computer and can do it on your spare time. 
2. It's cheaper, you can start with as little as $100 to an infinite amount. Where I'm from, studio apartments go in the mid 6-figures, and even in lower costs of living area, you still need several $1000s for a down payment, on top of multiple other costs, and a stable salary to continuously pay your mortgage. 
3. It's more liquid, you can sell at anytime you need, of course probably don't want to during a down market, but at least it's an option. With real estate, you could be stuck holding onto property indefinitely, and the amount of work to sell or rent out is significantly greater. 
4. There is more potential and money to be made, even if playing the lower risk game, and choosing common sense FANMG stocks, many of these stocks have gone up 2-5 folds over the last several years, meanwhile you'd be hard press to ever find real estate that can go up even 2x within 5 years, if even in 10 years. 
5. Much less work, at least compared to real estate, where you have to physically manage, deal with tenants, work on the legal side, and all the other hassles that can happen running a property. 

I could see it being different before this era, when it was much cheaper, but it seems like today, stocks are significantly more accessible, liquid, much less work, and have a higher potential to make even more money from too, so is there really any point investing in real estate today, aside from the actual property you have to live in?",Why would someone invest in real estate today when stocks seem much accessible and better?,,

**The Youth in Existing Gun Markets Support Liberalization**
Something like 60% of youth support gun rights; this is a big indicator that government policy will not do anything to harm the industry to a large extent.



**Firearm Popularity is Rising Worldwide**
Markets like Brazil under Bolsonaro or the Phillipines under Duterte have increased firearm purchased through liberalization or idolization, providing a future for gunmakers outside of the US and Russia. I also see Africa and the rest of SE Asia liberalizing gun laws in the next few decades.



**The rise of hyperpolarization and populism**
Uncertain or polarized political circumstances means more people hostile toward one another. This was at the fore during riots last year and the Capitol Insurrection. Partially as a result, gun sales were at record highs last year. I see this polarization, due to the spread of social media, rising across the globe and thus, long term gun sales.



**Long Term Industry Consolidation is Likely**
As with many other industries, consolidation is very likely in the firearms industry as they inevitably face scaling and uncertain political climates. Investors will benefit most from this consolidation provided you choose a company not going bankrupt.



**There's just a lot of room to grow**
Gunmaker's supply chain is ridiculously overcomplex with lots of simplification that could happen (Glock rates higher in this but they're private :( ). The merchandising chain also leaves lots of profit on the table (suppliers, coordinators, retailers, etc.). Models could also be optimized, tech better integrated, etc. There's just a lot of cash to grow into.





All in all, the gun industry presents an interesting opportunity for growth, beyond their current trading dynamic, something I will be tracking in earnest. Just wish Sig and Glock were public lol.



My Picks:

- Smith & Wesson: Will benefit most off of sales in the US, has enough cash on hand for consolidation opportunities, has ability to streamline, cult base, etc.


- Taurus: If Glock or S&W are the Apple of firearms, Taurus is the Samsung, the mass market firearm corporation that I believe will be immensely popular in developing countries, considering its success in Brazil and Colombia",The Small Arms Industry is Set to Grow Rapidly,,

So I came up with a short-list of they type of stocks I might look for in a period with volatile inflation.

1. Established Brand Name. This gives the company pricing power because clients are going to buy their product because of what they are getting is also associated with the brand and not just the product. Think AAPL, MCD, KO.
2. Commodity selling stocks, industrial sector ([https://etfdb.com/etf/RGI/#holdings](https://etfdb.com/etf/RGI/#holdings)). Think metal mines, lumber, companies that produce commodity byproducts that are used in industry (no discrete product firms, like jewelry makers).
3. Capitalist Europe. If it goes down in the USA, it all goes down - true, but there is a place where it will go down less relative to others. So, I'm looking at European companies that do not have diversity and inclusion in their 10K. These are actually young companies that are thirsty to grow and will do anything and everything to move up. Alternatively, I look at cultures who are still capitalist, think Russia, Poland, Ireland, Estonia.
4. Companies with more fixed-rate debt instead of floating rate debt. If the interest is fixed but there is more money in circulation the lenders are in trouble not the borrowers.
5. Government-backed stocks. Especially those that have defense contracts. I think that bad times create civil unrest with a potential for internal and external escalation. Think Northrop Grumman, Boeing, Lockheed Martin ([https://etfdb.com/etf/DFEN/#holdings](https://etfdb.com/etf/DFEN/#holdings))

11,2021-05-10 13:00:00,t3_n93uwi,n93uwi,investing,"Mental illness is among the most costly medical expenses in the U.S.,  and it has a high cost to employers in lost productivity. In 2019, 51.5  million adults were living with a mental illness in the U.S., and the  number of people suffering and drug costs, already in the tens of  billions of dollars annually, are projected to grow in the years ahead,  with Covid-19 compounding mental health issues globally.

Answering these questions will help to set you up for eventual success and develop your individual asset allocation strategy accordingly.

Let’s get to the facts: actively trading stocks, and timing market entries and exits come with inherent risks. Missing the best 10 days in the market between 2010 and 2020 would mean an overall decline of 33% (see [*Bank of America chart*](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/this-chart-shows-why-investors-should-never-try-to-time-the-stock-market.html) below). Moreover, it is unlikely you sell your assets right before a crash and buy back at the bottom. In most cases, the worst days are followed by the best days which would put you back on square one holding your cash waiting for the crash.

### Strategies to Pick Stocks

Although stock-picking follows a more active approach, long-term investing means being active 1% of the time while leaving your portfolio alone for the other 99%. It is important to keep in mind that less than 10% of all public companies drive 100% of long-term stock-market returns. Therefore your mission is to find the 10% and patiently ride the wave.

Some hands-on advice:

* **Limited diversification**, as you cannot continuously research each company you are invested in on a regular basis. The range of 10-15 stocks is healthy, otherwise, go back to the previous section and consider passive investing.
* **Flexible & innovative companies** can adapt their business model and expand their market potential. The companies with today’s highest market caps all have this trait in common.
* **Don’t ignore what is familiar**, in 1966 Walt Disney was valued at $80 million and they just produced Mary Poppins turning over $30 million alone on that movie. The company was well-known and anyone could have picked up a few shares. $1000 invested back then would average you over $4 million today.
* **Know your strengths** and profit from them. If you are mathematically gifted then focus on the fundamentals. If you work in the industry and know the competitive landscape and product lineup, do that. Find your own style of investing.
* **Google is your friend**, look up the approval rate of the CEO on Glassdoor, read job reviews, check the company’s premises on Google street view and go on the investor relations site of the company. You need to do your own due diligence because nobody physically audits the business you invest in.
* **Leadership and the CEO** are decisive for the long-term success of a company. If the leader of a company is also its founder and owns lots of stock in it, the interests are aligned with the other shareholders and hence money is invested more efficiently.
* **Human** **resource management** such as low employee turnover, revenue per employee, diversity, inclusion, and so forth.
* **Deep dive into the company**: How does it create revenue? What is its market potential? Market growth versus the overall market potential of S&P500? What are the competitive advantages? Cashflow structure? Insider selling? Check on earnings calls, shareholder letters, and sweat the fundamentals a little bit.
* **Impact**: Does this company contribute to a better future?
* **Don’t overpay** because even great companies can be too expensive when too much of their future earnings potential is already priced in. Microsoft’s revenue was 3x higher in 2009 than in 1999 and still, the stock had lost 50% of its value in that timeframe.
* **Avoid** owning a stock you can’t explain or you lack conviction in.
* **Double down** on companies that you are convinced are great investments for the long run even if you already own shares. If the business proves viable and returns are increasing, then it is likely to follow that trajectory in the near future.
* **Hold & wait**: trade as little as possible to avoid taxes and to enjoy the runups. The shorter you hold an asset the greater the chance that you have to close the position at a loss. The magic of compound interest will do the rest for you.
* **“Don’t lose money”** – Warren Buffett & treat every dollar as an investment.

I believe that beating the market is possible if you are patient and willing to invest time. After all, the business world is like a car race. In the last quarter of the race, it becomes more evident who might win, and your odds can be calculated with minimized risk exposure. Then you invest in the top-performing racers and still reap much of the benefits.

Keep in mind that most stocks underperform the market. The outsized gains of a few winners are pushing your portfolio higher and make up for any losses on the way.

## Cash

Oh, sweet cash sitting ducks in my account, what am I going to do with you? At current rates of around 1% (if even) it would take 70 years to double my money. By that time it is more likely that I am buried 6 feet underground. I wouldn't even get to experience my slim gains.

Yet there is some upside to holding a percentage of your overall portfolio in cash. Besides, you can’t pay your expenses off by handing out your stocks. Holding some cash is in both active and passive investing approaches detrimental. I advise holding approximately 5-15% of cash as it allows you to:

* Leave your portfolio in peace
* Remain calm during market volatility
* Jump in when prices are low and be opportunistic in the markets

Buying stocks in times of recession has historically brought about outsized gains for investors. It is worth remembering, the more it hurts holding some cash in market booms the more likely you will profit from a swift down-market. The best time to hold cash is when it really hurts to do so. Holding cash allows you to be prepared, and you don’t have to worry about timing the market.

([https://www.magnachip.com/magnachip-enters-into-definitive-agreement-with-wise-road-capital-in-a-take-private-transaction-valued-at-1-4-billion/](https://www.magnachip.com/magnachip-enters-into-definitive-agreement-with-wise-road-capital-in-a-take-private-transaction-valued-at-1-4-billion/))  


The deal has a definitive agreement and ""The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of shareholder and regulatory approvals"". Also ""The transaction is fully backed by equity commitments and not contingent on any financing conditions. ""  


The way I see it it's a 20% win in less than 6 months (they said second half of the year, so most probably will be sometime September-October-November). The risks are small:

Shareholders might oppose- but this is highly unlikely given the company is 78% own by institutions and the board of directors approves the deal.  
Regulatory things might kick in: this again I think it's low because we are talking about a 1 bil company, not something the size of ARM.

* “I can’t find any period in history where monetary and fiscal policy were this out of step with the economic circumstances, not one,” the chair and CEO of Duquesne Family Office said.
* Though he agreed with the early steps the Fed took during the pandemic, he said the policies have continued for too long.

Federal Reserve policies aimed at keeping markets and the economy afloat during the pandemic could end up threatening the long-term health of the U.S. dollar, investing magnate Stanley Druckenmiller told CNBC on Tuesday.

The chairman and CEO of Duquesne Family Office said the Fed’s insistence on holding interest rates down and buying trillions in bonds even though markets are thriving and the economy is booming is a long-term risk.

“I can’t find any period in history where monetary and fiscal policy were this out of step with the economic circumstances, not one,” Druckenmiller said during a”Squawk Box” interview.

Though he does not take issue with the Fed’s initial actions to combat the pandemic-related threats, Druckenmiller said the central bank has kept its foot on the accelerator too long.

He asserted that the Fed has continued its policies to help underwrite the spending binge in Congress, which has allocated more than $5 trillion in stimulus and is contemplating trillions more in infrastructure-related spending.

Over the long haul, he said, the policies and the heavy debts and deficits they support will threaten the dollar’s standing as the world’s reserve currency. That status means the dollar is accepted for transactions and as a store of wealth anywhere and is widely held by central banks around the world.

“If they want to do all this and risk our reserve currency status, risk an asset bubble blowing up, so be it. But I think we ought to at least have a conversation about it,” Druckenmiller said.

“If we’re going to monetize our debt and we’re going to enable more and more of this spending, that’s why I’m worried now for the first time that within 15 years we lose reserve currency status and of course all the unbelievable benefits that have accrued with it,” he added.

To be sure, others have warned in the past that Fed excesses could threaten the dollar, but the greenback has retained its position in the world.

One reason for that is there have been no other viable alternatives introduced.

Druckemiller has entertained the thought that a challenge could come from the crypto world. He said in the CNBC interview that the ultimate solution could be “some kind of ledger system invented by some kids from MIT or Stanford” though he conceded that “I don’t know what it will be.”

However, he noted that in the early days of the pandemic, other foreign governments already voiced their concerns about the dollar by selling Treasurys, the opposite of what normally would happen in a crisis when ultra-safe U.S. debt is generally seen as a haven.

Indeed, foreign holdings of government bills, notes and bonds actually have decreased, falling by $127 billion or nearly 2% over the past year, according to Treasury Department data. Foreigners hold nearly one-third of the public portion of the $28.2 trillion U.S. debt.

Druckenmiller said central banks have been the root of a lack of confidence in dollar stability.

“The problem has been clearly identified. It’s [Fed Chair[ Jerome Powell and the rest of the world’s central bankers,” he said. “There’s a lack of trust.”

Druckenmiller’s comments came a day after he and Duquesne partner Christian Broda said in an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal that Powell “needs to recognize the likelihood of future political pressures on the Fed and stop enabling financial and market excesses.”

Similarly, former New York Fed President William Dudley wrote in Bloomberg News that markets are underestimating how much the central bank will have to raise interest rates in the years ahead to keep up with the inflation it is trying to foster.

The Fed itself, in its semiannual Financial Stability Report last week, said it worried about risks coming from soaring asset prices.

Druckenmiller told CNBC he has “no doubt whatsoever that we are in a raging mania in all assets.”

&nbsp;

**Quick summary**

-   She has a long history of running funds that fit under ""discovery growth"" or ""global thematic"" styles.

-   Cathie has a **great track record outperforming the S&P 500**, but much of this has been due to outperformance of growth style. Also, this assumes you catch the very early cycles of her outperformance.

-   When compared to category style, almost all of Cathie's major **outperforming** years come during special periods in the market cycle, particularly in the periods following a market crash. With one other period of great performance during the 2017 BTC bubble craze**.**

-   Outside of those special events, Cathie's funds generally **underperform** equivalent style peers on a year-by-year basis.

-   She has a history of **leaving a fund during or** **following a period of underperformance**, then ""rebooting"" in another fund. This includes a short stint in **a hedge fund that lost over 80% of it's AUM**.

&nbsp;

Before getting into the deep dive, a quick note on benchmarks. Cathie's investment style fits into one of two flavors: **US growth** and **global growth**. The S&P 500 is not an appropriate benchmark at all for a growth-oriented or global oriented fund. Instead, for the years available, I will benchmark her to the Russell 1000 Growth and MSCI World Large Cap Index, as these fit her investment universe and demonstrate whether an investor would have been better off with a passive index fund.

Additionally, I'm going to compare her performance to some matching T Rowe Price Funds. Why T Rowe Price? First, their security selection universe is similar to Cathie Woods: they tend to prefer growth-oriented companies (i.e. think Amazon rather than Phillip Morris). Secondary, they have been around for a while and their funds have history dating back earlier than the indices I will be using.

Finally, for another reference point I will benchmark against Yahoo Finance's category averages for years where no index data is easily available. 

&nbsp;

In Summary:

-   To benchmark her ""discovery growth"" funds, I am going to use the **i-shares Russell 1000 Growth Index (IWF)** (subject to years available) as well as **T Rowe Price's New Horizon Fund (PRNHX).**

-   To benchmark her ""global "" fund, I am going to use **Vanguard Total World (VT)** (subject to years available) and **T Rowe Price's Global Stock Fund (PRGSX)**.

-   For years where no index data is easily available, I will instead use Yahoo Finance's category averages (average of of active fund performance, after fees).

&nbsp;

**1980-1998 (Jennison Associates)**

This is the one period for which I could not find any performance data, as there are only a handful of surviving funds from that period. She was apparently a portfolio manager and chief economist. I tried looking up fund history on the SEC website but could not find anywhere she is listed as a manager, even after searching shareholder reports for the period. It's possible whichever funds she worked on are no longer around...so unfortunately we need to skip this period.

&nbsp;

**1998-2001 (Tupelo Capital Services)**

Cathie co-founded this hedge fund in 1998..right as the dotcom bubble was building steam. ARK's company profile boasts that she managed $800 million in assets in 2000. Interesting that they give this figure for the very height of the market bubble. In 2001, as the market bubble crashes, Cathie leaves Tupelo Capital.

Unfortunately there is no accurate performance history for this hedge fund, but I have found AUM filings from the SEC.

In Q4 1999, the fund's AUM reached $1.0 billion.

Source (<https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-00-001292/>)

In Q1 2000, the fund's AUM then reached $1.3 billion.

Source (<https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-00-005389/>)

By Q4 2000, the AUM shrank to ~$800 million: matching Cathie's stated figures.

Source (<https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-01-001535/>)

Finally, by the end of Q1 2001, the AUM shrank to ~$200 million.

Source (<https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-01-502496/>)

In other words**, the fund's AUM shrank roughly 80% over 2000 and 2001**. Note that this would have been due to a combination of asset losses as well as investors pulling out, so it's not possible to know how much of that is due to actual equity losses.

By comparison, T Rowe's Global Equity Fund lost 17% across 2000-2001, roughly in line with the category average. Unfortunately Vanguard's Total World index (VT) did not exist during this timeframe.

&nbsp;

**2001-2013 (Alliance Bernstein)**

After Cathie left Tupelo Capital Services, she joined Alliance Bernstein. During her tenure she managed three funds that I could find:

-   AB Discovery Growth (**CHCIX**): A discovery/growth oriented fund.

-   AB Sustainable Global Thematic Fund (**ALTFX**)

-   AB Strategy Research Portfolio: Note that this is a Separately Managed Account (SMA) not an open mutual fund. I will use the acronym **ABSRP**.

**2014-2020: Ark Years**

For the Ark era, I am going to use ARKK to evaluate her performance. I'm using ARKK because first and foremost it is her flagship fund, and secondly because her specialty funds, while interesting, are nearly impossible to benchmark against. For another comparison, I am also going to add another passive fund to the mix, Vanguard's VGT (Technology Index), in addition to the Russell 1000 Growth.

&nbsp;

**2014: N/A**

There is no full-year history for ARKK in 2014.

&nbsp;

**2015: Cathie UNDERPERFORMS T Rowe, UNDERPERFORMS Passive**

Benchmarks I am using for ARKK are IWF (IShares Russell Growth 2000) and VGT (Vanguard Technology ETF) as a secondary benchmark. It turns out to not make a difference whether a year is a underperform or an outperform. 

-   **ARKK**: 3.76%

-   VGT: 5.02%

-   IWF: 5.50%

-   PRNHX: 4.50%

Summary: This is without a doubt the breakout year for Cathie Wood. How was this done? Can you guess what was the biggest contributor to her outperformance? Hint - it wasn't an equity holding. A position in Bitcoin Investment Trust is by far her top contributor, netting her 635, 748, 655 basis points of compounding outperformance in Q2, Q3, and Q4. Check out their quarterly reports and you'll see it's not even close. Note that the contribution of this is more than simply the compounding of 1.0635 * 1.0748 * 1.065..because this compounding is based upon the base of all assets. In other words..I estimate her actual returns without bitcoin would have been about 57%. Still great, but brings it down a bit more towards earth.

Q1 Return: 19.2%

Q2 Return 20.9% (14.55 without BTC)

Q3 Return 18.3% (10.82 without BTC)

Q4 Estimated Return 9.9% (3.35 without BTC)

**56.3% return without BTC (estimated)**

**87.4% return with BTC included.**

2020 bears no explanation. We all lived through the fun in the market last year. In case it isn't obvious, her biggest contributor for the year was Tesla, however there were many others as well and overall it was a much more balanced return profile versus that of 2017.

&nbsp;

**My take on ARK**

The following comes directly from ARK's own FAQ:\
""ARK's funds are fully invested and do not hold a material amount of cash. ARK generally will not use cash in a tactical manner.""

<https://ark-funds.com/help-center/what-is-the-typical-range-for-the-cash-position>

Let me explain in layman speak what this means. Here the algorithm Cathie follows to buy or sell:

-   When Cathie receives inflows, she buys

-   When Cathie receives outflows, she sells

Sounds a lot like the algorithm for a passive fund. You see, unlike most active funds...Cathie is not tactically using cash nor thinking of limiting inflows..even as she now sits with many billion AUM, and continuing to pump money into existing positions.

Unlike Cathie, **top active shops tend to hold higher cash positions during times of market euphoria and close funds when they are performing** ***too*** **well**. The exception to this are mega-cap blue chip funds, but Cathie is not running a mega-cap blue chip fund. The T Rowe Funds in my benchmarks for example are currently either closed or restricted to new inflows. Fidelity has done the same with very successful small or mid-cap funds. Let me quickly summarize what IMO are some of the best virtues of a good active manager:

-   Keep cash onhand and deploy it only when there is a reasonable risk/reward tradeoff.

-   Sell if the risk/reward tradeoff is no longer to the best interest of your clients, even if this means selling to a cash position.

-   If your cash grows too large or if your fund performs too well..you should consider closing the fund as otherwise it attracts short-minded performance chasers.

-   If there is a great buying opportunity (i.e. a market crash) and your fund is closed, you should open your fund to solicit new inflows.

-   You should try to keep your Assets Under Management (AUM) small if possible. The larger your AUM, the more difficult it is to make a winning bet on a small cap. Let's say for example you wanted to bet 5% of your portfolio on San Jose Water Company (SJW), an infrastructure holding of mine. Well...their total market cap is less then $2 billion. If your AUM was $100 billion, you'd need to buy the entire company outright just to make a small dent in the portfolio.

-   Your marketing to your clients should be reasonable and not overpromise. Telling your clients ""your goal is to beat the S&P 500 on a risk adjusted basis"" is fine as long as you are clear about risks involved.

I do not see Cathie following any of the above. Instead I am seeing a combination of dangerous behaviors:

-   Actively soliciting more inflows even when total AUM across Ark funds exceeded $50 billion. This is forcing more purchases into existing overcrowded positions.

-   Advertising that ARKK should double your investment in 5 years.

-   Regularly putting out videos, promotional materials, interviews, etc. promoting the house holdings with price targets significantly above most industry targets.

I do not believe Cathie is acting in her investors best interests. Intentionally or not, I believe Ark is essentially a pump scheme:

-   Buy companies with a marketable story and small revenue base but large revenue growth.

-   Promote the companies heavily: sell investors on the story.

-   Solicit inflows, use to buy more into those positions...sometimes owning up to 10% of the company. My theory is that this in itself is jacking up the price of those companies...

-   Sit back and **watch the stock's price grow at a faster rate than revenue growth**. This is not sustainable.

-   Until...well until what? You now hold a basket of companies trading at very high P/S ratios. Some of them might become the next Google, but surely they all won't become the next Google. You can try selling them to some greater fool, but good luck doing that with 10s of billions in AUM.

&nbsp;

Edit: lots of posts about how ARK cannot control inflows because it's an ETF. This is true and not Cathie's fault, but nonetheless it's a problem...or at least it's fair to say it's a flaw in the structure of active or concentrated ETFs. ARK is now suffering from the big AUM problem. Too much capital to chase after too few opportunities, victim of its own success.

23,2021-05-12 02:11:36,t3_nadzhy,nadzhy,investing,"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-04/sam-zell-buys-gold-with-inflation-reminiscent-of-the-1970s

Billionaire investor Sam Zell is seeing inflation everywhere, and has bought gold as a hedge -- something he says he used to knock others for doing.

“Obviously one of the natural reactions is to buy gold,” he said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “It feels very funny because I’ve spent my career talking about why would you want to own gold? It has no income, it costs to store. And yet, when you see the debasement of the currency, you say, what am I going to hold on to?”

Zell, 79, said he’s concerned not only about the U.S. dollar but other countries printing money as well, and questioned whether inflation will be transitory, as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated last week.

“Oh boy, we’re seeing it all over the place,” Zell said of inflation. “You read about lumber prices, but we’re seeing it in all of our businesses. The obvious bottlenecks in the supply chain arena are pushing up prices. It’s very reminiscent of the ‘70s.”

While gold is an attractive investment, opportunities in fossil fuels are not, said Zell, who in 2019 agreed to set up a joint venture with Tom Barrack Jr.’s Colony Capital Inc. to invest in oil and gas.

“Right now, oil and gas is not priced to reflect the risk of what’s going on, whether it be in the EV world, a climate changed world,” he said. “As recently as a couple of years ago I thought the risk-reward ratio was appropriate. It’s clearly become very inappropriate as our political situation has changed.”

Zell also said he’s concerned about renewable energy undermining the reliability of power grids, pointing to the recent blackouts in California and Texas.

In real estate, there are plenty of questions about what demand will look like over the next couple years in the office, lodging and retail sectors, Zell also said in the interview.

“Everybody’s worried about going back to work and office-space occupancy. I don’t think that’s really an issue,” he said. “The problem is that, before the pandemic, we were dealing with an oversupply of office space. Obviously the pandemic hasn’t reduced that oversupply and has probably encouraged it accordingly.”

Stores also present challenges, he said, given that the U.S. already had more retail space per person than the rest of the world before Covid-19, and shoppers increased their reliance on e-commerce while stuck at home during the pandemic.

“Street retail today is like a falling knife, and you don’t know how far it goes down,” he said. While that “doesn’t mean the best malls aren’t going to perform,” there’s a “huge amount of real estate that’s going to have to be reprogrammed in one form or another.”

The challenges faced by hotels are more of a temporary problem over the next three to four years, Zell said. “We will see a slow recovery in business travel,” he said. “In the interim period of time, it’s going to be a slow recovery, and hotels are big overhead things and running them at less-than-optimum occupancy is a very expensive scenario.”",Billionaire Sam Zell Buys Gold With Inflation ‘Reminiscent of the ‘70s’,,

There are a lot of seniors who are staying in their homes longer, and along with the many other forces at work, that is having a tightening effect on the supply, driving up prices.  When (if) we get this pandemic under control there will be a lot of older folks moving out of their homes and moving into senior living communities.  

I had been calling around looking for a place for my folks, and I have been getting bombarded with sales people looking to fill vacancies at the senior living facilities.  In talking with them a bit they were saying that they have quite a lot of available capacity.

31,2021-05-12 15:42:34,t3_narr02,narr02,investing,"As the cloud & big data continues to grow, as well as social media & 4k/8k video, data storage is becoming more important than ever.

Large social media sites take in a tremendous amount of data each day. This storage must not only be stored, but stored with redundancy as well as backups(usually to tape). Major sites such as Facebook and YouTube keep content that is over a decade old. Over time, the drives holding this content will fail and need to be replaced, leading to growing recurring demand as the size of the platform grows.

The need for storage has been growing for decades, but innovation in storage density and intense competition has limited profitability in the market in the past. That being said, there is reason to believe that the growth in storage density may stop keeping up with the growth in storage needs.

There is also reason to believe that transient growth in storage demand may drive higher Q2 earnings. A new crypto, Chia, has gobbled up about 3.5 Exabytes worth of storage in the past 3 weeks, growing at a rate of about 0.2 EiB per day(and rising). https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/netspace

For reference, about 288 Exabytes worth of hard drives were shipped in Q1 2021 https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hdd-shipments-in-q1-2021

Chia network size can be considered a lagging indicator for unexpected drive shipments. Generally, it can take a few weeks between when a drive is purchased and when it's actually accounted for on the network, as it takes time for it to be shipped, set up, and plotted. Chia wasn't even listed on exchanges until a week ago, so most of the growth seen is prior to Chia even having a price. At current prices, mining is incredibly profitable, with a $500 14 TB drive estimated to produce about $30 per day, and using very little power. So even if the network grows 10x to 40 Exabytes, it's still producing $3/day at current prices.

I have seen many anecdotes of drive shortages over the past couple weeks. Reviewing sites like Amazon, I have also seen high capacity drives go out of stock or require lead times of a few weeks.

This may be a bit reminiscent of GPU shortages among Nvidia and AMD as miners seek to buy up anything they can.

If we project continued growth at 0.25 Exabytes a day in unexpected demand from proof of storage over the next 48 days, plus the 3.5 Exabytes added since April 20(leaving out first 3 weeks in quarter as they were likely logged last quarter), that's about 15 Exabytes to be added in Q2 that are not part of normal usage, or about an extra 5% of Q1 demand.

What's perhaps most interesting is the impact this could have on margins. Unlike the GPUs used to mine which are consumer devices, the devices used for mining Chia includes enterprise grade hardware. Prices in the drive market are more flexible at the manufacturer level, and currently have much lower margins. If proof of storage currencies cause a drive shortage, it could have a significant impact on margins.

Seagate is also in a position to profit from this, but I'm a bit more worried about them as hard drive shipments have been on a long term decline and they aren't diversified into SSDs/flash like Western Digital is.",Western Digital - The Next Nvidia,,
32,2021-05-12 16:12:27,t3_nash4a,nash4a,investing,"Hi all, 

I was thinking about Ark funds and wasn't sure if I wanted to split it up between all of the individual funds or just keep it simple and go with ARKK. I wanted to know if ARKK was a decent representation of all of the individual funds. Kind of like if it was ""an ETF of all Ark funds"".

So I brought in all of the holdings into excel and conditional formatted for overlapping holdings. I then summed up the weighting from the ARKK fund to see how much of ARKK is comprised of holdings from each fund. Below are the results. 

ARKK shares X% holdings with X fund:

ARKQ: 24.59%

ARKW: 72.20%

ARKG: 30.63%

ARKF: 35.40%

ARKX: 6.53%

PRNT: 3.43%

IZRL: 1.4%

Obviously there's a lot of overlap so these numbers are going to add up to over 100%. 

But I was very surprised to see that ARKK is 72% similar to ARKW. Also surprised to see it's only 6.53% similar to ARKX, but that makes sense given it's the newest one. 

Anyway thought this was a fun exercise and figured I'd share if anyone else were interested.

I'm going to break down the numbers, and tell you why you're worrying your heads off over nothing. Precursor: Things haven't significantly changed, inflation is no more than it was last month.

#The month on month data:

There's a lot of information to take in, so I'll do my best to explain it in the comments, to anyone confused by what I'm saying. A lot of the explanations are very simple but here goes:

- All items less food and energy account for 79.125 weighting on the whole CPI. Digging into the data, the more heavily weighted portions is commodities less food and energy commodities (which carrys 20 weight). Furniture and bedding increased 2.1% (0.94 Weight). Living room, kitchen and dining furniture accounted for most of this (2.8% change), which can be attributed to the increasingly high lumber prices. 

- Transport commodities less motor fuel was helped push this number up quite a bit, seeing a 4.3% change, which is a 7 weighting. These include new and used vehicles, of which used vehicles sales solely drived up, with a change of 10% which can be attributed to the semiconductor shortage.

- Recreation commodities were up 1.2%, with a weighting of 1.9, with video and audio products essentially carrying this number above average with the help of recreational reading material (1.5%), toys (2.7%), information technology commodities (3.6%), and miscellaneous personal goods (2.1%).

As you can see, a lot of these either involved lumber, or semiconductors. These were all the sectors above the average, and a couple below, the rest managed to pull the full percentage of commodities less energy and food commodities down to a 2%.

The next sector we need to look into is Services less energy services (59 weighting).

- No big increases here in heavily weighted areas. Notable changes were a 7.6% change in Lodging away from home (0.9 weighting), a 10.2% change in Airline fares (0.59 weighting), and a 3.4% change in admissions (0.664 weighting) 

As you can see, this CPI didn't give any clear indiction of inflation. Each significant rise that significantly affected the CPI could be explained by the lumber and semiconductor shortage. There is so much fearmongering going around right now, that I felt like I had to put this out there, because clearly people aren't too willing to look deep into this. 

#The Year on Year CPI data:

If you really think this is evidence of inflation, you're not thinking straight. You're measuring from the bottom of the market, just after the pandemic became real, to where we stand now. 

Anyways, throw any questions my way, or you can find the CPI data if you think I've made all these numbers up. 

TLDR: No inflation (Well there is inflation, obviously, but you get what I mean), lumber and semiconductor shortage help to explain everything.",The Latest CPI numbers can be explained by the Lumber and Semiconductor shortage,,

As I understand it, inflation especially hyper inflation isn't a bad thing at all for a stock holder.
If your fiat of choice evaporates you wanna hold real values, like real estate or art, etc.
Why? Because they hold an intrinsic value that's not bound to a currency. And this is also true for stock's. So why fear it? 
I mean if you hold a large chunk of cash you should be scared of inflation and get rid of it.
Selling stocks because of inflation fears looks counter intuitive to me.

The only things I see here are that high inflation means the end of the endless money printing. Okay yeah get that. But at some point this has to stop anyways..

And maby a high inflation might make it more difficult for companies to make profits but that's all I can think of.

https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ltkij3/criteo_crto_why_one_of_the_biggest_adtech_players/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Though to be completely honest, the stock performance in the past 3 months hasn’t been as what I expected - mostly due to overall small cap tech getting crushed from asset rotation to reopening plays - but the company has been holding up pretty well against it’s peers. Criteo is more or less up around 5% in the past 3 months (15% off from recent intraday peak), while most of other small caps adtech players are down 40-60% from 3 months ago (even TTD is down almost 40%). 

I continue to feel Criteo is undervalued as a stock compared to its competitors and remain confident with the way the company executes their turnaround plan. For those of you who are not familiar with Criteo, they are making most of their revenue from Retargeting (80% of revenue) with the rest of 20% comes from higher growth areas. Here are the latest facts:

- Criteo is trading at around 2.5x ex-TAC revenue, while many of its competitors are trading at 10-30x (even after they came down by -40/-60%). 

- Retargeting which had been declared by most investment community actually expanded in Q1’21 (+4% for Criteo), even though travel industry hasn’t picked up and faces significant headwind from privacy regulations. 

- Criteo’s New Solutions (20% revenue) is growing at 60% per year with no signs of slowing down, helped by a shift to ecommerce by major offline retailers (Criteo is working with Target, Home Depot, Carrefour and many others) in which Criteo helped them to monetize their website. 

- Criteo has thousands of repeat brands clients (P&G, Adidas, etc), which could use Criteo’s New Solutions hence expanding its Target Addressable Market (TAM) exponentially to more than $70B.

- Criteo is financially sound - it has $600m cash, generating more than $120m free cash flow per year (which is going to increase if New Solutions continue to grow, cost cutting work is also on the way) and with minimal debt.

I have been watching ABNB price movement for a while, and it has been trending lower since Feb 2021. The price moved from $200ish to $134.  I initially purchased ABNB at $149ish and wanted to add more.  How low do you think ABNB will be?  According to a Motley Fool article, ABNB sold 51,551,723 million class A share at $68, and almost 80% of the shares are held by insiders and can't be sold until after the company reports earnings for the first quarter of 2021 on May 13. Even if we have a positive earning report  today, I tend to think that the lockup expiration could force the price even lower. I plan to buy more share at or around $110, but I feel like it could go even lower than that.  Thank you for sharing your input.

The Chinese population growth slowing is seen as a bad sign indicated by the decline in Alibaba stock price the day this was announced. However, an important thing to note is that the Chinese are not only getting richer but the Chinese middle class seems to continue to grow which is the more important number ([Yahoo!Finance](https://news.yahoo.com/jack-ma-makes-rare-visit-123439015.html), [St. Louis Fed](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2018/january/income-living-standards-china#:~:text=However%2C%20since%20the%20measure%20is%20based%20on%20the,median%20income%20but%20far%20below%20the%20world%20average))*^(Important because this directly impacts the market that the company is in)*

**Risks**

Slower growth metrics and loss of market share from companies such as Pinduoduo and JD.com

Dark clouds of the antitrust regulations and potential future regulatory concerns

Tensions between US and China relationships may serve as risky for Chinese companies/holdings in the United States.

**Note on investing in China**

A common point that I see on Alibaba or any Chinese ADR is that China can nullify any value of what you own at any moment simply because they don't like a company. While there are some elements of truth to this, intuitively speaking, this wouldn't make sense for China to do since they're trying to welcome MORE foreign investment.

In addition, there are many mutual funds, ETFs, and individuals that have exposure to China than before as referenced by the Alipay and Yahoo scandal ([Source](https://news.yahoo.com/news/yahoo-alibaba-softbank-reach-agreement-alipay-160402485.html)) which would be counterproductive to the point above.

To cut the knees of their technology companies even further as they're positioning themselves to be competitive to the United States wouldn't make sense. A recent notable event was the introduction of the digital Yuan for Alipay which indicates Alibaba is aligned with CCP values and will continue to show their willingness to work with them ([Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/10/china-digital-yuan-alibabas-ant-joins-e-cny-currency-trial.html))

**Conclusion**

Alibaba seems to have put the antitrust issues behind them with the Alibaba's growth is slowing as indicated by analyst reported estimates and current earnings. Although this may seem alarming, Alibaba is continuously reinvesting into growth opportunities which can hurt their short term bottom line. The growing Chinese middle class and disposable income per capita points to more good signs than bad for Alibaba. The middle class and income numbers are far more important than overall population numbers. Regulatory concerns aren't over for Alibaba in its entirety but the business is very solid and they've shown a willingness to comply with any new introduction to Chinese regulatory policy.

45,2021-05-13 18:58:24,t3_nbocck,nbocck,investing,"If you are investing covered calls or are interested in them let’s discuss it on this forum. 

I have recently gotten into covered calls because I like the risk reward that they offer. 

Let’s break down what covered calls mean. 

A covered call is when you buy 100 shares of stock and then sell a call contract. 

Covered means that you own the 100 shares so you are not using leverage since you own all shares of the contract. 

Calls are options that allow a buyer to collect profits after the price hits the strike price. 

When you do covered calls you sell these options on the options market. 

When you sell an option you get paid for the option to buy the stock at your strike price. I like setting my strike a few dollars above the current price. 

When the deadline of the option passes this contract expires. If the stock price is below the strike price then you keep all your shares plus the cost of the option. If it expires above the strike price then you give that money back to the person who purchased your option. 

Even if you have to pay someone that purchased your option that is a good thing as it means that you have recieved maximum profit on your trade. 

Worst case scenario the stock price drops. In this scenario you would be better off than the guy that just held 100 shares because you are also holding 100 shares but unlike a normal stock buyer you were able to collect the premium from when you sold the option. 


I love covered calls",Let’s discuss covered calls.,,

So obviously, having an allocation towards bonds helped during times of crisis, especially in the drawdown period, but not so much in the long run.

Surprisingly, even the added value of being able to rebalancing isn't so definitive versus holding. During prolonged downturns, you're rebalancing more into equities which continue to drop further and faster than your bond component. During recoveries, you may be rebalancing away from equity momentum.

Finally, if the bond allocation is only better than 100% equities during downturns, and if the long-run has 100% equities outperforming, isn't trying to have a bond component for the option to rebalance during downturns almost akin to market timing?

Is the only reason for bond allocation at this point volatility dampening effects? if that's the case should we be looking to cash? or even less correlated assets? or more diversification?

If the drawdowns didn't affect your ability to afford your life, i.e. no need to draw on even 20% of the portfolio for the next 10 years, should we just be 100% equities? Presuming the stomach allows it?

I know this might have been a roundabout way going at what we already have a rule of thumb responses for. ""no need for it if young and high enough risk tolerance"" or ""(120 - age)% in equities, rest in bonds"", but I'm having a hard time seeing even the slightest benefit to it. I haven't shown it here, but it's hard to even create a return/volatility optimal portfolio with it given recent data. Correlations are not as low as they need to be. If you really were a 70-year-old retiree, I would even say bonds don't have enough of a return premium relative to their risk over cash.

I would post this on /r/changemyview if it weren't so topic-specific. Why do you / would you include bonds in your portfolio?

Edit: so just to clarify, I’m not making the trivial point that bonds return less than stocks in the long run, or that they reduce volatility to your tolerance level - I’m just asking for the “pros” to owning them. The argument for being able to rebalance was the most compelling one for me (especially because I don’t have an income to dollar cost average), but I’m noting even that benefit isn’t super strong. 

I might look into the retiree case. I imagine another variable is ratio of expenses to portfolio. It would be interesting to see survival rates of different allocations on a 2 way axis against different expense/portfolio ratios and duration of living off portfolio. Maybe I’ll sim it out later. 

As a side note, despite this post, I do have a fixed income allocation. Granted, it’s levered such that the yield on cash is about 5% (it used to be as high as 12% on investment grade corporates).",The role of bonds in a portfolio,,

There are a number of other suggestions in the comments of similarly ill-fated IPOs which I could not add for brevity's sake.

11 of the biggest COVID tech IPOs in 7 different categories (cloud, crypto, gig economy, app economy, e-commerce, fintech, and real estate), all crashed following stellar public offerings. Prices rounded to the nearest digit.

* SNOW went down from $430 ATH in Dec to 314 in Feb to 232 on Apr 30 and 185 today.
* COIN sunk from ATH of 429 to 250 after narrowly missing earnings expectations today. At one point on the day of its IPO, retail traders were lapping up COIN for as much as $**429**. I will note though that BTC crashed yday for those unaware. As if ARKK bagholders weren't hurting enough!
* DASH crashed from ATH of $256 in late Feb to $110 yday before reporting a bigger-than-expected loss today. They're up 8% in after-hours.
* BMBL halved from $85 ATH to $39 after beating expectations yday.
* WISH crashed from ATH of 33 to 8 after earnings yday.
* CPNG is down from ATH of 69 to 31 after reporting a higher than expected adjusted loss yday.
* Qualtrics (XM) crashed from ATH of $57 to 29 today.
* SPAC merger OPEN crashed from $39 in Feb to its all-time low of 11 today after Tuesday earnings.
* ABNB crashed from $220 on Apr 28 to $133 after-hours today, down from its ATH of $217 on Feb 11 and up from its ATL of $125. The company announced today that their net loss tripled.
* AFRM is down from ATH of $147 in Feb to 47 today.
* Deliveroo (LON: ROO) crashed from ATH of £3.9 on IPO day to £2.3 on Apr 26 and trades at £2.4 today.

The one newly public tech company that seems to have weathered the storm is Roblox, which reported great earnings on Monday.

But it's not just tech companies that IPOd in 2020-2021. Hot 2019 IPOs Lyft, Uber, Pinterest, and Snap - which - except for Lyft, all reached their ATHs during COVID - saw significant gains during the pandemic, have also crashed since the end of April.

* LYFT tanked from $63 on Apr 28 to 46 today. Previously, Lyft dipped below $23 (ATH is close to $80) three times during COVID, most recently in Oct.
* In the same time period, UBER crashed from $58 to $44.
* PINS is down from 78 to 55 since Apr 27.
* SNAP dipped below $50 from 70 from Feb 23 to Mar 29 and is trading at 50 again today.

These companies aren't just sliding in after-hours or on the day after reporting earnings, we're looking at a prolonged downward trend over weeks either preceding or following earnings.","A reckoning for tech: 2020-21 IPOs Coinbase, DoorDash, Bumble, Wish, and Coupang record all-time low stock prices this week",,
48,2021-05-14 07:03:54,t3_nc2i7c,nc2i7c,investing,"Wondering what everyone's thoughts are on the upcoming Exxon annual vote that's being contested by a group called Engine No 1? They are seeking to break up the current board and vote in 4 of their own candidates in order to push the company into a greener direction. To grab a quote off their [website](https://reenergizexom.com/), ""ExxonMobil lacks a plan to create shareholder value in a world that seeks to decarbonize"".

I'm not really a seasoned investor, but I generally agree that Exxon stock has been underperforming for years partly because of increased demand and feasibility of cleaner energy, and the end of the petroleum energy's dominance is encroaching (we're inevitably going to run out of the stuff). The only ""green"" move by Exxon has been to invest heavily in carbon capture and storage; which is fine, but I'd like to see Exxon soon put together a solid plan to gradually transition out of strictly petroleum and get more involved in wind, solar, and other renewables - I'm most likely being really naive here.

In theory I like Engine No 1's objective but I guess my main concern is how effective or sincere they would be in their push for green and cleaner energy? Maybe they're just some investment firm using all this as an opportunity to place their own members on Exxon's board who'll just cash in and ultimately won't fulfill their stated objectives? I honestly don't know, and Engine No 1 probably won't get the votes they're looking for anyway. I'm anticipating that at some point I'm going to eventually divest from Exxon while putting more of my money into clean energy ETFs or something.

tldr, I'm having a crisis of confidence in buy-and-hold index investing strategy

**Backstory:**

I'm 38 and live in the USA. I'm employed, and I make the median national income. I want to accrue wealth over the long term. I don't know that I have an accurate understanding of my risk tolerance. I think generally I am very cautious. Before yesterday I was about 70% equities, 15 bonds, 15 cash. I just sold off a lot of my stock. I'm waiting for the account to settle to see my new allocation, but I'm certainly under 50% stocks at this time. I have no debts.

I have been a buy & hold index fund investor for the 20 years of my adult life. It always sort of bothered me that I didn't understand the underlying mechanisms of the markets I was investing in. At some point in the last decade I learned about the Schiller p/e index and thought ""hmm, this doesn't seem good..."" I read *Random Walk,* and I think I understood most of it.

**The Bug Out:**

Recently, I heard a Grantham interview and read some Hussman, and their gloomy prognostication really struck a chord with my natural inclination towards pessimism. They say current prices are unthethered from the underlying assets and and that this is true across all sectors of the market. My friends and the forums are full people  throwing money at speculative investments (crypto, SPAC, etc). My elders are telling me to blindly invest in an index fund and forget about it, because 'historic returns, don't miss the market's big days, it worked for them, etc.'

My armchair diagnosis is that there are a lot of people like me that are blindly investing in broad index funds that could care less about the underlying value of the assets as long as the price keeps going up. I suspect at some time in the future we'll look back and see that index funds were a craze like any other and laugh at the certainly we currently feel that these assets will return 6-8% on average until the end of time. Looking at you Vanguard (who recently told me that a 'normal asset allocation' was 90-95% stocks...hmm). I also think we'll look back and see that the last trick the boomers played on us was propping up their asset valuations with Fed policy and leaving us to hold the bag.

Worst of all, it doesn't seem like anyone I speak these concerns to (friends, family, investment advisors) is really taking them seriously or even hearing them. Am I turning into a flat-earther? Is the king wearing any clothes?

**What Now?**

I've been told you shouldn't try to time the market, and I've read the explainers about how I'm likely to mistime by selling below the peak, buying before the trough, and missing out on gains while out of the market. Frankly, I'm at a point where I don't believe in the market at all. Is not believing in the market at all the same as timing it?

I've heard that market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. I've also read that by definition there is never greater certainty in the market than the day before the bubble pops.

I'm not sure I can just put all of my money in an index fund and sleep at night.  I have the following questions. Have some of you had a bug-out like I'm having now and that led you to value investing? Do you still believe in index funds in this current market? The knowledge requirements to be a value investor seem much higher than for an index-fund investor. It's crazy intimidating. Do I just start reading your investment bibles and leave my money on the sidelines until I understand how make investment decisions in individual companies?

tldr2; I am questioning the fundamentals of my buy-and-hold index fund approach to investing. What the hell do I do?

Retail sales were flat on the month, falling short of expectations of a 1% gain. However, the monthly gain for March was revised up by a full percentage point to 10.7%., leaving aggregate spending roughly where economists expected it to be over the two months.

Core retail sales fell 0.8% on the month, rather than rising 0.7% as expected. Here too, the March figure was revised upward to a gain of 9.0% from an initial estimate of 8.4%.

James Knightley. chief international economist with ING, said via Twitter that the staged reopening of the economy also meant that spending was draining away from goods to services. 
""Re-opening means increased options for spending money, meaning a movement away from “things” to “experiences” that aren’t measured within retail sales,"" Knightley said.

The figures once again testified to idiosyncracies in consumer spending patterns as the economy emerges slowly and unevenly from the Covid-19 pandemic: sales at auto dealerships rose 3.1% on the month, corroborating the robust demand for cars that had also been evident in the sharp rise in prices for vehicles in April's inflation report earlier in the week.

By contrast, sales of apparel fell 5.1% and sales at hobby and sporting stores fell 3.6% on the month, having surged in March. 

March's data had been skewed by the effect of stimulus checks arriving at households across the country which, coupled with the start of economic reopening, had resulted in an explosion in overall spending.
""It was inevitable that there would be some declines in spending in April given that the vast majority of the $1,400 checks had already been paid out the previous month, but the details show sales in most categories reversing only part of their earlier surge,"" said Andrew Hunter, senior U.S. economist with Capital Economics in a note to clients.""

Hunter noted that spending on food and drink services rose 3% on the month, after surging 13.5% in March as bars and restaurants across the country reopened in growing numbers. It's now only 2% below its pre-pandemic peak, he argued.","Retail Sales Stagnate in April, But Offset by Upward Revision to March Data",,

Say what you want about Seeking Alpha, but this writer is generally considered the most analytical author there and in no way limits her team's work to Seeking Alpha. I notice some people don't like the website, which is fine, but this woman could write for Forbes or academic journals etc. if she wanted to do so, in my opinion.

The article looks at inflation, money supply, international responses to inflation, and its effects on different classes of people. It also touches on how different asset classes may play out under different conditions.

Of note is her conclusion that people who scream hyperinflation are farcically wrong, but she also notes when short term heavy inflation rears its head it stays on and doesn't dissipate. Say, if 5% inflation happens one year, it remains, even if it doesn't feature heavier inflation going further. Like many things in investing, the likely outcome is the middle road.

She also points out how the macro economy may be trending more towards labor over capital. Overall I think such effects would balance out, as better wages and cheaper equities seem great to me personally, although she doesn't delve very far into the thought.

My portfolio is equity REIT heavy so I especially liked her explanation of how real estate does okay with both higher inflation and higher interest rates, contrary to popular belief. Entry point is key--fixed rate debt is of course the best to have in an inflationary environment. 

""Interest rates: When interest rates rise, it puts downward pressure on most asset prices, as we saw in the inflationary decade of the 1970s. When interest rates remain low, then monetary inflation remains a decent environment for asset prices, as we saw in the inflationary decade of the 1940s from the market bottom in 1942.""

""Pendulum swings: Whenever the balance of power favors the wealthy, due to some combination of offshoring, automation, and the political environment, then monetary inflation is more likely to translate into asset price inflation. Whenever the balance of power shifts towards labor, due to labor onshoring, labor organization, and/or populist politics gaining a foothold, then monetary inflation is more likely to translate into consumer price inflation. This is largely correlated to wage increases or lack thereof, as well as being correlated to the size and scope of government transfer payments and tax policy.""

""Inflation: During periods of moderate to high inflation, gold and commodities tend to do extremely well. Equities outperform bonds more often than not, but it depends on the type of equities and their starting valuations, and therefore have a huge variance. Real estate does well, mainly because leverage attached to it gets melted away from inflation. Bonds do poorly in inflationary environments.""

""Deflationary shock: If temporary deflation is caused by a deflationary shock, such as a recession or depression, bonds are the place to be, and outperform everything else. Gold also generally does fine compared to other assets. Stocks and commodities usually perform very poorly.""

""Productive deflation or disinflation: Bonds and stocks do well in goldilocks periods of strong real growth, with low inflation and high productivity gains. Between the two, stocks can do better. Commodities and gold are prone to poor performance in this type of environment.
My base case going forward continues to be that with the combination of sizable broad money supply growth, along with public opinion pushing the pendulum back away from globalization, consumer price inflation is likely to be higher in the 2020s decade than in the 2010s decade.""

These points may be common knowledge to some, but I found it informative. Consumer price inflation is pretty identical to what we think of as ""inflation,"" so it seems fair to submit inflation will be higher than we are used to but not catastrophic or anything. So, for me, I like to think my REITs, most of which have pretty strong rent escalators linked to CPI (up to 3% annually with base increase no matter what), will do fine over a multi-year period. 

I hate precious metals since I don't really think of them as hard assets--it's just a series of price quotes to most people who hold it--there is some correlation to real estate. Consider how the ticker LAND had pretty extreme outperformance compared to its own asset class during 2020 which is still ongoing since that REIT focuses on owning specialty crop farmland with water rights. It outperformed gold swiftly, yet probably appeals to the same kind of buyer and pays cash dividends. 

I'd also like to remind people many REITs invest in free-standing properties on a triple net basis and that retail stores are still opening up en masse, largely among discount retailers which easily co-exist with internet commerce in poorer areas (think Dollar General, which works with companies like Instacart). Even with covid there was no retail apocalypse among corporate discount retailers. Most of these lease to REITs and pay a good deal of rent.

It may also be worthwhile to consider that with higher than usual inflation comes a risk of higher than usual interest rates being implemented, again, not to a catastrophic scare mongering level. Financials that focus on offering floating rate loans may do well over the coming years. Burry recently invested a good deal of money in a multi-cycle weathered business development company, Ares Capital, which would organically benefit from even minor rate hikes.

I think the best thing I pulled from the article is: don't worry so much. Inflation will happen, but it won't be insane. Perhaps focus less on long duration equities, ie. very high multiple tech corporations, and at least consider adding assets that are more down to Earth.",Lyn Schwartzer on Inflation Trends,,

Fundamentals on Google are sound: strong recurring revenue base, monopolistic tendencies, value add to customer, network effects, cross selling across revenue streams etc.  I find it hard to argue that Google is going anywhere anytime soon.

Valuation wise, many think that FAANG is overpriced.  Some of it is.  Google trades at a whopping 37x earnings! But only 24x forward.  And only 15x fwd EV/EBITDA.  That is the metric I will focus on for now as I tend to use DCF models with EV/EBITDA terminal values.  The average EV/EBITDA multiple over the last 10 years is about 16x.  The lowest was 10x and 10x is the lowest it ever traded since IPO.  Using a DCF model and using ultra bear scenario of the following assumptions: 2022-2025 revenue growth of 0% annually (yes, correct),  gross margins of 55% (below the 10 year average of 60%), operating margin of about 23% (10 year average 25%), D&A constant at 8% of revenue, Capex in line with Bloomberg estimates approx 16-17% of revenue, and change in NWC of about -3% (consistent with last 4 years).  WACC is 9.5% and used a 10x exit multiple.  This estimates an intrinsic value of $2068, about -9% from current values.  And that is the bear case with ultra bearish assumptions.

The base case then with revenue growth of 10%, same margins, higher depreciation based on consensus estimates, and an exit multiple of the 10 year average of 16x yields a price of $4831, upside of 112%.

Of course, I never truly depend on a DCF model to provide an exact price because there are so many assumptions that will never play out as expected, but it is a great tool to identify what factors impact price and some worst case scenarios.  It is further evidence to me that Google is one of the most undervalued large caps with a wide moat around its largest product, expanding its range and interconnectivity of its products constantly, and generating a significant amount of cash in the meantime.

Let me know your thoughts.

Edit: Cant disagree more with the Mod post below.  EV/EBITDA is a widely accepted method of DCF analysis especially when comparing firms with varying amounts of leverage.  EV/EBITDA is a terminal multiple used to estimate a value for the company at the end of the forecasting period.  The forecasting period still uses FCFF.

The outperformance of PSLDX is pretty clear. I am not very familiar with its methodology, but I did some reading and encountered the opinion its outperformance may not last due to a potential rise of interest rates. So I looked at a couple of other metrics--please keep in mind I don't know much about the bond market overall and would be happy to learn I have examined things incorrectly. 

I chose 2016 because it captured when the Federal Fund Rate started to meaningfully rise (they also started to rise in 2015, but I chose a nice 5 year slice). They increased steadily into 2019, then plateaued a bit, then of course were struck down by covid.

[https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart](https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart)

Next I looked into the daily treasury yield curve rates from this period. The 10 Year rate fluctuated steadily all throughout 2016 but ultimately ended the year higher. It fluctuated similarly through 2017, ending very slightly lower. It increased during most of 2018, then only ended slightly higher by the end of the year. It lowered through the end of 2019.  It ended much lower by 2020. And through today it is higher than in 2020, but still much lower than it has been in years. 

[https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/TextView.aspx?data=yieldYear&year=2016](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/TextView.aspx?data=yieldYear&year=2016)

Below is a plot of the dividends paid from PSLDX, where all the gains are to be had.

[https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSLDX/dividends/history](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSLDX/dividends/history)

You'll notice the higher dividend payouts tend to correspond to where the higher interest rates are plotted. Granted, the fund holds the S&P, so its outperformance can in part be explained by the general rise of the S&P 500 equities since 2016. But, I did not find where higher interest rates pose a risk to its performance. I also noticed its highest-ever dividend payout was in 2013, where the federal funds rate was miniscule and the 10 Year increased from 1.86 to 3.04 by the end of the year. And even when interest rates are very low, say from 2020-2021, the fund still outperforms the S&P ETF listed, much less our favorite REIT. O, I can forgive, since I believe in its long term success. 

[https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio#analysisResults](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio#analysisResults)

It appears the fund generates a great deal of alpha the higher interest rates become. It also generates alpha when interest rates are low. Drawdowns can indeed be high, so if one were to invest in the fund, it is likely best to put money into it after it has experienced a drawdown, or simply do what investors should do and put money into it that you don't plan on using for many years. 

The share price is low--this is common with many mutual funds. Someone recently mentioned that as a drawback to it... yes, it is lower than the 10 dollar price in 2007... but I think if you understand this is a particular sort of fund and not some silly low budget penny stock, the difference is clear. It is a volatile fund, yet appears to have an overall stability over time, with extreme dividend payouts. While I think broad market ETFs are great for capturing the mood of the overall corporate economy, the more I read about this particular fund, the more I find it to be a good choice for outperformance over a multi-year period. People worry about so many things: expense ratios, volatility, weird methodology. Yet, total returns tend to present their own strong argument for an investment. 

It appears to benefit from higher interest rates, and also does fine with lower interest rates. That is what I find to be especially interesting (ha). It's not a 3x leveraged daily fund subject to decay or anything like that, to my knowledge. It may even be simpler than your average PIMCO CEF.  

I plan on trying to learn more about the fund before I actually put money into it, since I want a firmer grasp of its mechanics and especially want to determine if it can maintain its performance over more time. In the meantime, I think it's overlooked by everyone but niche investors. Plenty of garbage tickers are passed around on Reddit (hello bizarre mortgage REITs that obviously destroy value over time and fraudulent SPACs) but there is little popular information on this fund which is still kicking out solid performance since the Great Recession when derivatives really were the devil. 

Anyway when I post on Reddit, I do so to learn. I very recently posted about the fund here--this was before I looked at interest rates and how they may correlate with it. I am becoming more convinced it is a good investment and would like to know arguments against it beyond the fact it's more complex than a simple passive ETF.","S&P 500, Realty Income, and S&P 500 Long Duration",,

That company is AT&T (T) and we’ll break-down some opportunities & challenges this cash-generating machine faces in the mid-to-long term.

**The Overview**

AT&T has three business segments: Communications, Warner Media, and Latin America. AT&T’s communications segment contributes \~79% of operating revenues and \~80% of profits. AT&T’s recent acquisition of Warner Media adds to AT&T’s development, production, and distribution capabilities. The Warner Media acquisition has been broadly successful, comprising 17% of AT&T’s revenues and 22% of profits. Warner Bros. is one of the largest TV and film studios globally, remains a media powerhouse with a profound content library that reaches audiences across many platforms.

In this day and age huge “value” is seen in the amount of users or customers a company has reached. A quick glance at Zoom and we can see that a large portion of their value comes from the 300 million users they leverage. Coming back to AT&T they have over 170 million customers across numerous products to go along with a broad array of content rights.

**HBO Max**

One of AT&T’s biggest risks over the next 5 years comes from their acquisition of HBO Max. Main concerns are over whether or not they can retain or grow the service’s subscriber base and ultimately increase earnings. Management has recently **increased expectations** of the HBO Max subscription base to reach between 120 to 150 million subscribers by 2025, which is up from their relatively conservative estimate of 75-90 million in 2019. Here’s a look from their recent earnings presentation  

AT&T is progressing in its postpaid wireless, and HBO Max segments, which saw \~800k lines and an additional **\~3.5M subscribers added in their previous two quarters**. Consumers are willing to spend more on high-quality internet service as work from home continues.

**Final Thoughts**

When we look at AT&T’s share price over the last 10 years and we see the stock is up roughly 10% during that time-period it doesn’t necessarily instill confidence as a profitable investment. Some might argue why purchasing shares of AT&T would be a better investment than a “more secure” bond play. However, it is our opinion that AT&T is at a turning point and we may now be able to see the best of both worlds, a high yield dividend return, as well as steady growth in revenues.

A 5% return per annum, paired with its high dividend yield of \~6-7%, allows AT&T to remain more attractive than treasury bonds even with the associated risk of holding shares. Despite increased debt levels and decreased credit ratings, AT&T has a strong strategy to reduce its debt burden. AT&T should continue to have a dividend payout ratio at roughly 50% of FCF, acting as a bond proxy in an investor’s portfolio.

There is [no shortage](https://bioinformant.com/biotech-investing-stem-cell-stocks/) of individual stocks in this area (also take a look at Humacyte).

Given that widespread adoption (and development) of the technology is still years off, and that there is tons of competition in the space, the probability that any single stock I were to choose listed in the link above is going to be a winner is likely quite low. 

I'm thinking that investing in an ETF focused on these technologies specifically might help lessen the risk a bit. In my searches so far, the only close match I could find that puts a lot of emphasis on stem cells and regenerative tech is [ARKG](https://ark-funds.com/arkg), but it has a much broader focus than stems cells/regenerative medicine alone (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). The major hesitance that I have about that fund is that it puts so much weight in Teledoc health (TDOC), which appears to be one of the major contributors the ARKG's decline over the past 6 months. I'm not entirely convinced that telehealth is the way of the future (but I'm biased because I prefer in-person visits, so feel free to convince me otherwise).

Perhaps this suggests some of these media assets will push into cord-cutting and streaming, further suggesting the end of linear TV.

The deal is likely an attempt for HBO Max and Discovery + to form a giant conglomeration that can take on Disney + and Netflix. AT&T owns HBO, CNN, Cartoon Network, TBS, TNT, and Warner Bros. Studios. Discovery owns Food Network, HGTV, TLC, and Animal Planet.

*The Trade Desk Inc is a global technology company that markets a software platform used by digital ad buyers to purchase data-driven digital advertising campaigns across various ad formats and devices.*


**What I learned from Q1 call** 

**Three Big Drivers for the future** 

* CTV 
* UID 2.0 
* Solimar Platform 

**So why do they matter?** 

**CTV** 
- CTV is an umbrella term, compromises of both Internet T.V and smart T.Vs.
- More consumers switching from Cable to CTV 
- Major content owners moving more premium content online 
- T.V providers continue to fight for consumer attention 

**Current Problem**
- Advertisers currently are paying premium prices to publishers (Websites like ESPN) without getting the value of said premium price. 
- The Trade Desk would allow them to not only receive that value but advertisers would now have the ability to be more deliberate about what CTV ads they buy and how to apply data driven decisioning in T.V at an increased scale.


**UID 2.0** 
- This in TTD's eyes is the future of the internet in a world without cookies. This would essentially replace them. 
- I will do my best to explain said function, but to understand why does this need to be a thing and what is it solving? 

**Current Problem** 
- What the TTD is trying to accomplish is to create a free and open internet, an internet that can move past the walled gardens of Google, Facebook, Apple Ect. In fact the CEO Jeff Green uses the following sentence. ""Is the internet going to be controlled by large tech companies or will power be distributed. Will choice sit with consumers and each content owner?""

- We've heard of google and apple ending third party cookies in an attempt to ""protect"" their customers, which is true to an extent. 

**What UID 2.0 going to do to change the internet** 
- UID 2.0 is Open Source meanings you are able to build on it, and it is about a better internet allowing consumers to have control.
 
**How it Works** 

**1)** Consumers sign in once with an email (this email is your *common ID*)
**2)**  You will opt in site by site, app channel only once
**3)** When you log in once, you will receive an email authentication providing consumers with the explanation of the value exchange of the internet. The idea is to make it clear and consistent. 
**4)** This common ID will be used by advertisers and publishers 
**5)** Consumers are then able to use privacy settings to change or opt out directly from the services they know. 
**6)** The consumer controls their data, it's not controlled by Big Tech. 

**But its Big Tech, how can they penetrate those ""Walled Gardens""?** 

- *Double Encryption Publishers (DEP)*
- This allows publishers to encrypt UID 2 and allows them to unencrypt it for certain advertisers or publishers. DEP prevents others from taking data and insight from publishers. (Yes even Big Tech) 

**Solimar** 

- Solimar is the TTD's biggest platform upgrade in their history (Well that's what Jeff said)
- It is bringing together current existing features TTD offers and is making it easy to use for marketers 
- **Koa AI** for example is a current feature the is being upgraded and integrated into Solimar 

**Koa AI** 
- Koa AI is well... AI. It analyzes data from across the internet to help make sure you’re reaching the right audience at the right price. As Koa learns, it optimizes your campaigns automatically.

- ""Solimar helps advertisers want to understand how their campaigns are driving in-store sales. Building that off-site data into Solimar, whether it's retail stores or auto dealerships or ticket sales or any other form of business performance data, so the advertising campaign can seamlessly optimize for those business goals."" - Jeff Green

- He explains it better than I could
 
- Solimar helps solve the problem of media marketers who have big plates to fill and who are running massive campaigns. 
- Solimar liberates the media trader to focus on campaign performance rather than having to turn the dials on every aspect of campaign management

**Why TKC?**

So I have been researching about Turkcell, a Turkish company that is traded in BIST (Istanbul stock exchange) and NYSE. It had my attention because its been under performing compared to both global stocks and Turkish stocks (even though it's been performing really well financially compared to other companies traded in BIST). Before dipping to $4.67 USD due to pandemic in late march - early april, it was traded for $5.77 USD (early march 2020) and it was around 10-11 USD during 2018. As of today, it's traded for only $4.56 USD. Biggest reason for that freefall of the stock price is downfall of the Turkish economy and the devaluation of the Turkish lira but other Turkish stocks doesn't seem to care as much as TKC does. For comparison, march 2020 dip of XU100 (adjusted by the USD exchange rate of that time) index was 114 (857/7,5), now it is 171 (1441/8.4). There has been a Turkish stock exchange rally even in USD terms as well, which TKC missed. Not to mention that Turkish banks performed terribly and they have around 17% [weight in the XU100.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EqbtfSZXUAEnwu0?format=png&name=small)

**About the company**

So the company is primarily a telecommunication company (like Vodafone). Even though it offers value added services like BiP (mainly whatsapp alternative), Fizy (spotify alternative, TV+, Paycell (fintech), Pasaj (e-commerce mostly selling tech products), Lifebox (cloud service), Yaani (search engine), Dergilik (digital publishing platform) it's primary source of income is telecommunication and internet for home via Superonline (Turkcell company). The company operates in Turkey, Ukraine (lifecell), Belarus, Azerbaijan, Cyprus, Netherlands and Germany (though their operations in the last 2 are not directly profit seeking afaik). Main competitors in Turkey (main market) are Vodafone and Turk Telekom. Vodafone and Turk Telekom offers cheaper prices but Turkcell offers better service and as of today it has the highest share of the market with 42%. Turkcell also invests more than the combination of the competition, [you can check their mobile data segment investments here](https://hwp.com.tr/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Mobile-yatirim.jpg). One last fundamental thing about company's operations is that it is part of the [TOGG project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOGG) (electric car company founded recently and according to their CEO, they will start the mass production is 2022) and owns 19% of the TOGG as well. The taxes for foreign made cars in Turkey are extremely high and the rumor is that the government is thinking about subsidizing this project to decrease country's account deficit by both not depending on foreign made cars and oil (which Turkey doesn't have).

**Financials**

I don't want to rewrite what is already written in detail so I will provide some sources instead.

[1st Q 2021 presentation (1.1B TL net income)](https://s.turkcell.com.tr/hakkimizda/en/yatirimciiliskileri/InvestorReportLibrary/Presentation-Q121-ENG.pdf)

[Annual report of 2020 (4.24B TL net income)](https://s.turkcell.com.tr/hakkimizda/en/yatirimciiliskileri/InvestorReportLibrary/Turkell-IAR-2020-ENG.pdf)

Their net income kept growing for a while, you can check more about their financials [in their website here.](https://www.turkcell.com.tr/en/aboutus/investor-relations) Check [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yIDdTqig4k) as well.

**Possible things that may drive the value up.**

I already talked about the TOGG project above, but the investors seem to didn't care about it. I think they have their doubts about the project (which is understandable due to fragile Turkish economy). But I believe if the mass production starts in 2022 it will have a really good impact on the stock.

Another thing is possible IPOs. In february this year, CEO stated that they are considering the IPO of their home internet company, Superonline. According to bloomberg, they started talking with the investment banks about it in April. You can read more about it [here.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-06/turkcell-is-said-to-approach-banks-on-ipo-plan-for-internet-unit) Also, they were considering the [IPO of Global Tower in 2016](https://www.reuters.com/article/turkcell-globaltower-idUSL8N1CU4JX) but they didn't do it calling the market unsuitable for a new IPO. Considering the IPO madness happening in Turkish market, they may also consider it. I also want to remind you that vodafone did a similar IPO last year and they had a pretty good valuation.

Lastly, the stock had management issues before. The company couldn't share dividends and it had decision making issues as well. But as of June 2020, this problem is solved because Turkish Wealth Fund bought the stocks from Telia and Karamehmets. Now the company gives dividends quarterly (0.39 TRY per quarter and the stock is valued 15.20 TRY atm in Turkey, not sure about it in NYSE). I believe investing in TKC just because of the dividend is an enough reason.

**One important thing that caught my eye**

Last month one of the foreign institutions sent the [mandatory notification](https://www.kap.org.tr/en/Bildirim/932236) that their shares passed the 5% barrier. I was watching their aggressive purchases and they keep buying. [This is the buyers-sellers chart for the last one and a half month](https://imgur.com/a/juARwKD). Gedik investment made the 77% of the purchases. Gedik then transferred it to Deutsche bank. During that period amount of shares which are **held by the foreigners increased by 30 million stocks.**

**Why you should NOT buy/why is it undervalued?**

As I mentioned above, TRY is not performing well. Lately, Turkish Lira lost good portion of it's value. This is the main risk for this stock in my opinion. But the thing is, **82% percent of the float is held by the foreigners**, and even though the foreigner's interest in Turkish stock exchange kept decreasing, their shares in Turkcell kept increasing. It seems they think that it is a good buy despite the risk of Turkish Lira. I also believe that it is a buy for sure long term, but it is risky for the short term. Also, even if the TRY performs well, there is a possibility that with the possible interest rates increase, **DXY may start it's bull run which will negatively affect the stock.**

Another thing is, in October, Letterone will have the ability to sell some of their shares in the stock exchange. It is not clear whether they will or not, but it is risky since it will increase the shares traded. Last year, they sold some of it on the market for 15.5 liras per share (15.20 is the current price of the stock).

&#x200B;

**Summary**

I believe that this stock is a good buy because of their financials, dividend, investments (mainly the electric car project TOGG), incoming IPO and accumulation of the stocks by certain investment group. But there are 2 main risks as well, fragile Turkish economy and the stocks held by Letterone. But even with those risks, I dont think it will devaluate more at this point.","Turkcell Communication Services ($TKC), why you should/shouldn't invest in it. Fundamentals of an undervalued stock.",,

BASIC COMPANY INFORMATION

Lockheed Martin is aerospace and defence company which provides very high-end military equipment. Aircraft is where they particularly shine with the F-35 accounting for about 30% of the company's revenue.

The lion's share of the company's revenue comes the united states government. Most of all aircraft used by the air force comes from this one company.

CEO INFORMATION

Lockheed recently announced in 2020 a new CEO to run the company. His name is Jim Taiclet .While having several years of experience with Lockheed, his previous experience as CEO was not with another defense company.

Most of his career was spent running the successful REIT known as American Tower (AMT). The company has been very successful both during and after his tenure. (Which is another great dividend growth company I might add).

DIVIDEND HISTORY/SAHRE BUYBACKS

Quarterly Payout (At A Glance)
2020 - $2.60
2019 - $2.40
2018 - $2.20
2017 - $2.00
2016 - $1.82
2015 - $1.65

Dividend Yield = 2.68%

Payout Ratio = ~40% (Very Safe)

Let me start be saying that this company is EXTREMELY  profitable. The company is currently on an 18 year consecutive dividend streak. Not to mention the company buys back BILLIONS of its own stock year in and year out. I fully expect this company to be a dividend aristocrat in a few years.

The dividend yield is about double that of the S&P as of today and only has a Payout Ratio of about 40%. This means that not only does this company has a good yield while buying back stock, but this company can EASILY afford to maintain and RAISE the dividend over time dramatically.

The company has a long history of M&A activity and the most recent example of this Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD). This is yet another example of the company using its financial fortress of a balance sheet and exemplary cash flows to acquire other businesses.

AJRD is a space and aeronautics company which could potentially extend more deals with NASA and the U.S. government. This was recently announced about six months ago in December 2020 and is likely to finalize in 2021.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION

The company has incredible financials. The balance sheet is a financial fortress. The debt load is very controllable. Cash flows continue to pour in record numbers year after year and 2021 guidance issued by the company expects record revenue and record EPS for the year. 

The Biden administration just issued an increase in defense spending of about ~1% earlier this year. All the more reason for this company's financials to continue to stay healthy. Financials linked below....

GROWTH STORY MOVING FORWARD

LMT is expected to grow top-line revenue numbers 4.50% in 2021 and 3.70% in 2022. Earnings per share for  the company in 2020 finished at $24.58. This is expected to grow to $26.68 in 2021 and $27.90 in 2022.

Contracts are usually signed many years in advance. Revenues can be easily forcasted for the next several years due to the timelines of the contracts. Furthermore, innovation is not only encouraged, but expected by shareholders AND the united states military is order for our nation to maintain relevant in terms of weaponry.

New age military equipment is usually pretty ""hush-hush"" on what is in the works but Lockheed Martin does disclose some of these new products including technologies such as new highly intelligent drones, missile systems, and even targeted lasers.

One thing is for sure, the military will continue come out with bigger and badder weapons. Who will likely be selling it to them? Probably good ole LMT.

Newer acquisitions such as the recent AJRD deal allows Lockheed to also focus on other products in the space category and is another wildcard with some potential.

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE/ BARRIER TO ENTRY

If you were given 10 million dollars, and your goal was to create a globally recognized soda brand, could you get it done? Maybe. What about 10 million to create a social media platform? Also a maybe. But could you start a aeronautics and/or defence company with 10 million budget? Absolutely not.

The regulations are incredibly strict. The demand for capital is VERY HIGH with projects frequently running into the billions of dollars. Switching from one business to another poses risks for the government and our military and are usually avoided.

This makes the U.S. government very loyal and sticky to LMT business and this is very likely to continue. While there are competitors in the space....Lockheed continues to dominate this market.

VALUATION (WHY IT'S A GREAT BUY IMO)

As mentioned earlier, the company is expected to produce $27.90 in EPS in 2022. Based of of today's price of $390, this gives this company a forward PE ratio of ~13.9. This is an EXTREMELY low forward PE ratio for a company putting up record numbers and dominating the market that it operates in. 

This is even more impressive considering it's still off a fair amount from it's previous all time highs. I am very bullish and this is one of my largest positions. I am not remotely interested in selling. I am buying at these prices or really anything even close to these levels. I wouldn't sell a share if this company were to go to $800 a share tomorrow morning.

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LMT/analysis?p=LMT

RISK FACTORS TO CONSIDER

Almost all revenue comes from one customer (the government). It is steady and consistent but if the government were to fall out of love with Lockheed then this company would be negatively impacted.

There aren't many who could take down LMTs throne but their main competitor is Boeing. Boeing has the capital and leverage to compete with Lockheed Martin long term.

This company is susceptible to a number of different geopolitical risks. Conflicts with other countries could be both a Negative AND a positive for Lockheed.

The current political climate is leaning harder and harder towards a more relaxed defence budget.

There have been fears of inflation lately that have been sending markets down over the last few weeks. My question is, what will happen if/when inflation really does come and the fed has to deal with it? 

To me it seems similar to stocks going down after reporting amazing earnings, which were already priced into the stock and when the earnings were revealed, people took profits. Could this be a similar thing where when inflation comes, a lot of the pain has already been had because the market priced it in already?

The following are pretty big points of pointing you out as Hype Trader or as i like to personally call them, BRO traders:

1. You started trading/investing after the pandemic (~March 2020 or later)

2. You tend to overly idolize Elon Musk and his tweets about where certain conditions in the market are

3. You bought Dogecoin AFTER $0.02 cents

4. You are losing most of your investment value as of present because all you bought was PLTR and NIO or similar stocks of that nature

5. You have since moved on from Stocks and are now more focused on Cryptos

6. You tend to ""buy the dips"" with no real analysis of why you should keep buying apart from gambling or other people telling you to do it

I've read that equities usually take a hit because it becomes more expensive for companies to borrow (so they borrow and invest less and are therefore estimated to have earnings decrease relative to some previous amount/projection, or they borrow the same but have to earn more of it to pay it back, which is harder for them to do or siphons profits from dividends/re-investment et cetera).

I've also read bond values in general take a hit because people don't want to hold a 10 year bond at 1.5% when they can hold a 10 year bond at 2% so they sell the lower-yield bond and there are fewer buyers so the price goes down and all that. Different bond durations react differently, but they all decline, at least temporarily.

If these two understandings are generally true, which usually gets hit worse from an interest rate increase, stocks or bonds? Or do they both get hit the same? Is there a duration element to the decline in value that each experiences, or is that the same as well? Basically, all else being equal, simply from a growth point of view, which is better to hold when interest rates go up? Or are there just too many variables to consider (how much interest rates go up, how quickly, and for how long they're expected to stay at that level)?","When interest rates go up, do stocks and bonds get hit the same?",,

I know that not everyone has a precise method to do DDs and research about a company or a stock, but maybe someone does.I'm  from Europe, i'm pretty new in this world and i'm trying to be as more informed and smart as i can.

So, there are some things you have to do if you want to become a successful investor / trader, one of the most important is certainly to research and understand the company you're investing in and the financial instrument you're about to use.

When it comes to do some DD about a stock, i understand there are multiple things to look at.What are the most important in your opinion ? What instruments do you use and why ?

Heres what i'm doing for now:

I usually start reading about the company, its core business and the news about it, then i try to understand what is the financial / economic condition of the company and then i do some technical analysis on the chart, focusing on the price and the value i think the stock could have, and also using MA, EMA, MACd, RSI indicators.

I use mostly Yahoo Finance and [Investing.com](https://Investing.com) for the economical and financial part, and mostly WeBull for the charts.

Coinbase also expects to grant the initial purchasers of the notes a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $187.5 million principal amount of notes solely to cover over-allotments.

The live TV streaming provider posted blowout financial results after Tuesday's market close. The stock had hit a six-month low earlier in the trading day. 

Coming through with its third consecutive quarter of accelerating year-over-year top-line growth since going public late last year, fuboTV was full of positive surprises. A historic sequential increase in subscribers during a seasonally sleepy quarter. A big boost to its full-year guidance. FuboTV had [a lot to prove](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/05/11/fubotv-stock-has-a-lot-to-prove-this-week/) heading into this critical financial update, and it delivered. 

Playing to win 

There's a lot of skeptic silencing in fuboTV's first-quarter performance. Revenue soared 135% to $119.7 million, well ahead of the 98% to 102% that it was [forecasting in early March](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/03/good-luck-betting-against-fubotv-stock/). This is the second time in a row that fuboTV has put up lowball guidance that it beat with ease. It's a trend that bears noting -- and respecting. 

There's still plenty of red ink here, but with operating expenses only up 80% relative to the 135% top-line burst we're seeing net loss and adjusted EBITDA margins improving. FuboTV's average revenue per user is rising, and against that welcome trend the live TV platform is clocking in with a sequential improvement in subscriber acquisition costs. 

We're seeing tailwinds riding tailwinds here. FuboTV now has 590,430 subs on its books, 105% more than it had a year earlier. Revenue is growing even faster on the heels of a 131% surge in subscription revenue and ad revenue more than tripling. Another neat tidbit on its subscriber count is that it's also 43,000 higher than it was in December. This is the first time that it actually posted a sequential increase in accounts during the first three months of the calendar year. 

FuboTV now sees 830,000 to 850,000 subscribers by year-end, up from the 760,000 to 770,000 it was targeting just two months ago. This is old hat for investors as fuboTV jacked up its 2020 subscriber goal in October, November, and January last time out. This should also be a reminder that any likely revision in a couple of months will probably be higher yet again.

With average revenue per user approaching $70 a month between subscriptions and ads, can things get even better? Well, fuboTV is still on track to roll out a free-to-play interactive gaming app that will enhance the live sports it streams through more than three dozen channels. The stakes will be raised in the fourth quarter when Fubo Sportsbook launches in markets where it can clear legal hurdles. Fantasy sports and then actual wagering will make fuboTV even more money than they are right now, but more importantly, they're going to improve engagement. 

FuboTV has been one of the wildest stocks since its [IPO](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/ipo-stocks/) seven months ago. It was a six-bagger at one point, only to shed more than three-quarters of its value by Tuesday's market open. A blowout quarter is the perfect cure to market indifference.

Younger folks that are sharp jump ship frequently, often completely resetting there knowledge base within the industry as the technical knowledge on specific subjects is hard to transfer. Many people that can, leave for tech if possible. Competent people that stay often get swooped into management. 

There is virtually no allocated budget for knowledge transfer and the above effects have created an intense pessimism among the older senior engineers. Everything must be “off overhead”.  Director level and above often have no technical understanding of there products beyond a surface level and focus on decision making based on performance metrics for cost and schedule that are too simple to gather a real understanding of what’s happening.

147,2021-05-17 21:53:45,t3_net1s9,net1s9,investing,"I was wondering what the investing hivemind might think about the situation I'm in. I had posted this in personalfinance as well to get their opinion.

Have a house where I am currently refinancing to a 2.75 30y fixed rate (including 4500 in lender credits)

Appraisal just came in and it is, somewhat predictably, a high value. 

I was thinking to do a cash-out refi instead of a rate-and-term, take out ~100k in cash to bring up the mortgage to 80 percent of the new value.  I could afford this with my monthly budget but it would be tighter, around half my net pay after taking out all taxes/401k/hsa/roth contributions.  Would still be <30 percent of my gross pay (including PITI). The rate would stay the same but I'd have to pay 1k in points instead of receiving a 4500 lender credit.  (or I could get a 2.875 rate with a 2k lender credit).

My thinking was that, because the loan interest rate is so low, it makes more sense to grab the cash and then invest it (index fund, rental property, etc) rather than keep it in the house piggy bank.  Inflation is high these days, so I wasn't looking to keep much in cash - but I did want to increase my emergency fund slightly before investing the rest.

Do people think this is a good idea or is it better to keep the LTV lower and stick to a rate and term refinance?

Thank you!",Cash out refinance to invest in lieu of rate-and-term?,,

I’d agree also that functioning social democracies are capitalistic and have property rights, but they have also nationalized industries and put controls on the market in certain areas, so are these socialistic policies? I don’t agree with the blanket assessment that putting power in the hands of the government is necessarily a bad thing, provided that the government is genuinely representative of the people.

237,2021-05-09 14:48:18,t3_n8fpef,n8fpef,investing,"So I was reading up about how the Fed can attempt to influence credit availability and long term interest rates by controlling what is used to calculate the SLR (as they did last year 1st April).

My understanding that the SLR requirements are put in place to ensure banks have enough capital with respect to their risky assets such that if they lose the assets (eg people defaulting on loans and mortgages as they did in 2007/8), they have sufficient capital to cover those potential losses such that they will not go under.

However, I have trouble understanding **why** certain things are included in the calculation, and some not. My google search has mostly been futile as the same findings are repeated about what is the SLR, what goes into its calculations. I want to understand **why** it is the case.

So to start off, the definition of the SLR =  Tier 1 Capital / Total Leverage Exposure .

1. Tier 1 Capital includes ""Common Equity Tier 1"" and ""Additional Tier 1 Capital"".
2. Total Leverage Exposure refers to ""Both on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet assets exposures"". Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think of it as assets that have a **risk of declining in value** (eg derivatives, loans, etc).

For 1, my main trouble is understanding ""Common Equity Tier 1"", which investopedia says it ""comprises a bank’s **core capital** and includes **common shares**, stock surpluses resulting from the issue of common shares, retained earnings, common shares issued by subsidiaries and held by third parties, and accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI).""

* To me, when I think of a bank's core capital, the first thing that pops into my mind would be the actual amount of cash they have (minus deposits since deposits are not factored in to the SLR anyways). But clearly I'm missing something here because cash is nowhere to be seen. I was thinking that that it is better expressed in the form of retained earnings, because that would have accounted for any expenses and liabilities.
* Another thing is the bank's own common shares being considered core capital. While I understand, if banks need to take losses on assets and continue operations, they can fall back on their retained earnings, which in a way helps buffer the losses since all these earnings are the net income accumulated over the years of operation. But can banks use their own shares for this purpose? Essentially, the question is, how can **banks use their own shares to protect themselves from asset loss**? How do shares play that role? Honestly I think I'm carrying one big misunderstanding somewhere, and hope someone can shed some light into it.

Now, for 2, the Fed introduced a temporary change on 1st April 2020 (and which has since expired) where ""the change would exclude **U.S. Treasury securities** and **deposits at Federal Reserve Banks** from the calculation of the rule "". This effectively lowers the denominator for the banks, increasing their SLR and giving them more leeway to **lend out their capital (cash), providing credit for the economy**, and also allows them to **park more of their (non-productive) cash into US treasury bonds (which give interest), thus lowering bond yields**, helping the Fed control long term interest rates. These two outcomes, as per my understanding, was why the Fed allowed this change in light of the Covid shock to markets and the economy.

* I can understand and accept that US treasury securities, although almost considered to be risk-free, are still debt assets (which are inherently risky), and hence included into the equation in which banks have to hold a certain amount of capital against. What I don't understand is why deposits at the Federal Reserve Banks are included. My understanding is that banks, instead of keeping excess reserves/deposits with themselves, they can deposit them with the Fed and get a small interest on it (better than nothing). But why is this considered into the equation? Will these assets (deposits at the Fed) **have a risk of being lost if the Fed is somehow unable to return them**?? If yes, what situation will it be where the Fed cannot return the deposits? If no, why is it part of the SLR equation, and why is there a need to hold capital against it?
* When the expiry was drawing near, and as banks were lobbying the Fed to extend this SLR change, one of the reasons I saw was that banks would have to ""decrease deposits (pushing savers out of holding deposits)"", essentially meaning turning away people who want to deposit money with the bank. **Why would reverting the change mean that banks have to turn away deposits?**
* After the expiry of the change, the fear that banks would now have to sell treasury bonds to meet SLR requirements (and cause a rise in yields that would hamper economic recovery) did not materialize. Instead, it was reported that banks were raising cash by issuing debt. This would imply that this increases their core capital. Why is this possible when cash is not included in the definition of core capital? After all, this also has a net neutral effect on their balance sheet, since the increase in cash will be offset by an increase in liabilities to their creditors.

As one can see from my myriad of questions, I'm definitely no banker or accountant or whatever, in fact just a barely 20 y/o kid trying to learn more about the financial world. My understanding towards the SLR is probably ridden with misunderstanding and would really appreciate if people, or actual bankers over here, can help me clear it up.",Understanding the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR),,

This is the first time I have ever seen every single asset class so substantially inflated: stocks, real estate, crypto currency. Whatever it is, every asset class is at all time highs. We all know the reasons why this is the case: excessive money printing & all time low interest rates have created a yield hungry environment with inflated asset prices. 

I don’t want to waste time talking about why this is the case, but I would like to know, what are you doing to protect yourself against the eventual correction in asset prices?

239,2021-05-09 16:21:06,t3_n8hkut,n8hkut,investing," Ray Dalio, the master of the LinkedIn essay and co-CIO of a minor hedge fund, is the subject of the next installment of investing styles. Ray’s All-Weather Fund is a risk-parity approach to investing, an approach that aims to diversify equal risk amongst a set of assets that have minimal or negative correlation in the event of rising or falling growth and inflation across the world economy.

The set of assets in Ray’s approach is wider than most individual investors consider: Emerging Market Credit, Corporate Credit, and Commodities, in addition to equities and bonds. Ray’s selection of assets in his risk-parity fund was driven by his belief that there are 2 core environmental drivers of markets - growth and inflation. Different assets in the portfolio perform under the 4 possible combinations of rising or falling growth and rising or falling inflation. Rather than allocating solely to assets that perform well over a falling inflation/falling growth regime, he spread the allocation over assets that perform under each of the four possible regimes. Helpful grid of the assets that perform in each regime here: [https://imgur.com/HnQ3Qp0](https://imgur.com/HnQ3Qp0). Since the market is forward-looking, what matters for classifying the regime is not just the direction of growth and inflation, but whether or not the direction is already expected, and thus priced into the market. You want to have assets that are durable when inflation or growth surprises to the upside/downside. 

Now for the controversial element of risk-parity: leverage. Rather than allocating an equal dollar amount to each of the assets outlined above, the allocation strategy is to employ leverage on lower volatility assets to achieve higher mean return at the cost of higher volatility and of the interest rate of the borrowed dollars used to lever. For example, if you have an asset with a 2% historical mean return and 5% historical volatility then you could achieve a higher expected mean return by leveraging the asset 2x to increase the expected mean return to 4% while expected volatility is now 10%. Additionally, you should expect to pay some interest rate on the margin used to implement the leverage.

The decision of how much to lever is usually set by targeting a total portfolio volatility and then giving each asset in the portfolio an equal volatility budget. If it’s a lower volatility asset, for example TIPS or investment grade corporate bonds, then the leverage ratio is higher. But for a volatile asset like equities there may be no leverage at all since the existing asset volatility already meets the volatility budget.

It isn’t intuitive how in theory applying leverage in this way can actually decrease portfolio volatility over time so it’s helpful to compare a 60/40 equities bond portfolio against the risk-parity allocation to equities and bonds. In the 60/40 portfolio the total portfolio volatility is dominated by the equity component. In the risk-parity portfolio the same mean-return as the 60/40 portfolio could be achieved with lower volatility by allocating less to equities and more to bonds and applying leverage. If you are a nerd and interested in more theory about portfolio allocation strategies under risk parity I recommend this AQR overview: [https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/White-Papers/Understanding-Risk-Parity](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/White-Papers/Understanding-Risk-Parity) 

So how does Ray think the average Joe should invest using this risk-parity theory jumbo? Well, he did an interview with Tony Robbins in 2015 suggesting a 55% allocation to US bonds but every recent interview is about cash being trash, US bonds being dumb and investing in Asia. If you happened to have a couple billion dollars you could directly invest in his hedge fund but for us poors we’re stuck with mutual funds and ETFs. The central idea of risk-parity can be applied in your own portfolio by diversifying among assets that will perform well in different regimes. If your portfolio doesn’t have any assets that perform well under a rising inflation/rising growth regime then consider looking into commodity ETFs and inflation-linked bonds.  


The choice to use leverage as a retail investor is harder to recommend than the ideas around diversification. The theory of leveraging lower volatility assets in order to achieve higher return makes sense but there are downsides. One is that retail investors will pay higher costs to use leverage, either in high-fees for leveraged ETFs or in higher margin fees than institutions. The other, perhaps more relevant, risk for retail is failure to manage the risk of leveraged assets well. There must be rebalancing between assets to maintain the risk budgets of each asset and if the correlations of assets within the portfolio change then the fundamental assumption of assets performing under different regimes can be violated and leverage ratios should be managed accordingly. Another option is to trust a mutual fund or robo-advisor to manage this risk-parity approach for you, but as noted above the implementation matters and the fee drag of expensive risk-parity products should be considered.  


Hopefully you can take some ideas about allocating risk across your portfolio, considering other asset classes, and the performance of your portfolio under different market regimes into your own investing style. Next time, I will cover Christopher Cole’s long term investing style which aims to protect against the tail events that even risk-parity funds do not handle well.

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/uHzGByl.png) is the latest screenshot of the portfolio performance. The more astute among you may notice the straddle is shorter term than I intended. I will fix this Monday at the open.

Overall the portfolio was up 3.27%. Most of this was due to Commodity Trend and Gold, but equities and treasuries produced positive returns as well. It seems the reflation narrative is still humming along. Comparatively, the SPY was up 0.6% and TLT was up 0.3%. Another week of beating the 60/40 portfolio.

241,2021-05-09 21:04:56,t3_n8nkcd,n8nkcd,investing,"Traditionally, real estate was always seen as one of the best kinds of investment, but imo that's largely because knowledge on stocks was much more rare, and it wasn't as easy back then, since there weren't many investing apps, higher fees, and it wasn't as easy to do. 

While there are of course still challenges and risks, there seems to be countless reasons today why stocks are now much easier and better, and barely any reasons to invest in real estate, given how expensive real estate has become right now, and this is coming from someone who's followed investing for several years now, seen multiple crashes, as well as bull markets as well.  

With stocks 

1. The barrier to entry is much less, you just need an app or computer and can do it on your spare time. 
2. It's cheaper, you can start with as little as $100 to an infinite amount. Where I'm from, studio apartments go in the mid 6-figures, and even in lower costs of living area, you still need several $1000s for a down payment, on top of multiple other costs, and a stable salary to continuously pay your mortgage. 
3. It's more liquid, you can sell at anytime you need, of course probably don't want to during a down market, but at least it's an option. With real estate, you could be stuck holding onto property indefinitely, and the amount of work to sell or rent out is significantly greater. 
4. There is more potential and money to be made, even if playing the lower risk game, and choosing common sense FANMG stocks, many of these stocks have gone up 2-5 folds over the last several years, meanwhile you'd be hard press to ever find real estate that can go up even 2x within 5 years, if even in 10 years. 
5. Much less work, at least compared to real estate, where you have to physically manage, deal with tenants, work on the legal side, and all the other hassles that can happen running a property. 

I could see it being different before this era, when it was much cheaper, but it seems like today, stocks are significantly more accessible, liquid, much less work, and have a higher potential to make even more money from too, so is there really any point investing in real estate today, aside from the actual property you have to live in?",Why would someone invest in real estate today when stocks seem much accessible and better?,,

**The Youth in Existing Gun Markets Support Liberalization**
Something like 60% of youth support gun rights; this is a big indicator that government policy will not do anything to harm the industry to a large extent.



**Firearm Popularity is Rising Worldwide**
Markets like Brazil under Bolsonaro or the Phillipines under Duterte have increased firearm purchased through liberalization or idolization, providing a future for gunmakers outside of the US and Russia. I also see Africa and the rest of SE Asia liberalizing gun laws in the next few decades.



**The rise of hyperpolarization and populism**
Uncertain or polarized political circumstances means more people hostile toward one another. This was at the fore during riots last year and the Capitol Insurrection. Partially as a result, gun sales were at record highs last year. I see this polarization, due to the spread of social media, rising across the globe and thus, long term gun sales.



**Long Term Industry Consolidation is Likely**
As with many other industries, consolidation is very likely in the firearms industry as they inevitably face scaling and uncertain political climates. Investors will benefit most from this consolidation provided you choose a company not going bankrupt.



**There's just a lot of room to grow**
Gunmaker's supply chain is ridiculously overcomplex with lots of simplification that could happen (Glock rates higher in this but they're private :( ). The merchandising chain also leaves lots of profit on the table (suppliers, coordinators, retailers, etc.). Models could also be optimized, tech better integrated, etc. There's just a lot of cash to grow into.





All in all, the gun industry presents an interesting opportunity for growth, beyond their current trading dynamic, something I will be tracking in earnest. Just wish Sig and Glock were public lol.



My Picks:

- Smith & Wesson: Will benefit most off of sales in the US, has enough cash on hand for consolidation opportunities, has ability to streamline, cult base, etc.


- Taurus: If Glock or S&W are the Apple of firearms, Taurus is the Samsung, the mass market firearm corporation that I believe will be immensely popular in developing countries, considering its success in Brazil and Colombia",The Small Arms Industry is Set to Grow Rapidly,,

So I came up with a short-list of they type of stocks I might look for in a period with volatile inflation.

1. Established Brand Name. This gives the company pricing power because clients are going to buy their product because of what they are getting is also associated with the brand and not just the product. Think AAPL, MCD, KO.
2. Commodity selling stocks, industrial sector ([https://etfdb.com/etf/RGI/#holdings](https://etfdb.com/etf/RGI/#holdings)). Think metal mines, lumber, companies that produce commodity byproducts that are used in industry (no discrete product firms, like jewelry makers).
3. Capitalist Europe. If it goes down in the USA, it all goes down - true, but there is a place where it will go down less relative to others. So, I'm looking at European companies that do not have diversity and inclusion in their 10K. These are actually young companies that are thirsty to grow and will do anything and everything to move up. Alternatively, I look at cultures who are still capitalist, think Russia, Poland, Ireland, Estonia.
4. Companies with more fixed-rate debt instead of floating rate debt. If the interest is fixed but there is more money in circulation the lenders are in trouble not the borrowers.
5. Government-backed stocks. Especially those that have defense contracts. I think that bad times create civil unrest with a potential for internal and external escalation. Think Northrop Grumman, Boeing, Lockheed Martin ([https://etfdb.com/etf/DFEN/#holdings](https://etfdb.com/etf/DFEN/#holdings))

246,2021-05-10 13:00:00,t3_n93uwi,n93uwi,investing,"Mental illness is among the most costly medical expenses in the U.S.,  and it has a high cost to employers in lost productivity. In 2019, 51.5  million adults were living with a mental illness in the U.S., and the  number of people suffering and drug costs, already in the tens of  billions of dollars annually, are projected to grow in the years ahead,  with Covid-19 compounding mental health issues globally.

&#x200B;

Drugs long stigmatized, such as psilocybin and MDMA, are rising in  profile as mental illness treatment options. Just last week, results  from a phase 3 trial of MDMA combined with talk therapy for  post-traumatic stress disorder showed results that were impressive.

“This  is a pivotal event,” said Elemer Piros, a biotech analyst at Roth  Capital Partners who covers the emerging alternative mental health  treatment space. “It may not seem humongous, but it is one of the best  and most rigorously executed trials in the space. And the results  corroborate what we have seen time and time again from smaller studies  over the past two decades,” he said, referencing remission rates double  that of a placebo. “The magical experiences kept showing up, but no one  had the courage to take it through to regulators.”

247,2021-05-10 13:22:19,t3_n94bfc,n94bfc,investing,"Before we get into the juicy details, think for yourself: What are you shooting for? What is your financial goal? How risk-sensitive are you? Answering these questions will help to set you up for eventual success and develop your individual asset allocation strategy accordingly.

Let’s get to the facts: actively trading stocks, and timing market entries and exits come with inherent risks. Missing the best 10 days in the market between 2010 and 2020 would mean an overall decline of 33% (see [*Bank of America chart*](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/this-chart-shows-why-investors-should-never-try-to-time-the-stock-market.html) below). Moreover, it is unlikely you sell your assets right before a crash and buy back at the bottom. In most cases, the worst days are followed by the best days which would put you back on square one holding your cash waiting for the crash.

### Strategies to Pick Stocks

Although stock-picking follows a more active approach, long-term investing means being active 1% of the time while leaving your portfolio alone for the other 99%. It is important to keep in mind that less than 10% of all public companies drive 100% of long-term stock-market returns. Therefore your mission is to find the 10% and patiently ride the wave.

Some hands-on advice:

* **Limited diversification**, as you cannot continuously research each company you are invested in on a regular basis. The range of 10-15 stocks is healthy, otherwise, go back to the previous section and consider passive investing.
* **Flexible & innovative companies** can adapt their business model and expand their market potential. The companies with today’s highest market caps all have this trait in common.
* **Don’t ignore what is familiar**, in 1966 Walt Disney was valued at $80 million and they just produced Mary Poppins turning over $30 million alone on that movie. The company was well-known and anyone could have picked up a few shares. $1000 invested back then would average you over $4 million today.
* **Know your strengths** and profit from them. If you are mathematically gifted then focus on the fundamentals. If you work in the industry and know the competitive landscape and product lineup, do that. Find your own style of investing.
* **Google is your friend**, look up the approval rate of the CEO on Glassdoor, read job reviews, check the company’s premises on Google street view and go on the investor relations site of the company. You need to do your own due diligence because nobody physically audits the business you invest in.
* **Leadership and the CEO** are decisive for the long-term success of a company. If the leader of a company is also its founder and owns lots of stock in it, the interests are aligned with the other shareholders and hence money is invested more efficiently.
* **Human** **resource management** such as low employee turnover, revenue per employee, diversity, inclusion, and so forth.
* **Deep dive into the company**: How does it create revenue? What is its market potential? Market growth versus the overall market potential of S&P500? What are the competitive advantages? Cashflow structure? Insider selling? Check on earnings calls, shareholder letters, and sweat the fundamentals a little bit.
* **Impact**: Does this company contribute to a better future?
* **Don’t overpay** because even great companies can be too expensive when too much of their future earnings potential is already priced in. Microsoft’s revenue was 3x higher in 2009 than in 1999 and still, the stock had lost 50% of its value in that timeframe.
* **Avoid** owning a stock you can’t explain or you lack conviction in.
* **Double down** on companies that you are convinced are great investments for the long run even if you already own shares. If the business proves viable and returns are increasing, then it is likely to follow that trajectory in the near future.
* **Hold & wait**: trade as little as possible to avoid taxes and to enjoy the runups. The shorter you hold an asset the greater the chance that you have to close the position at a loss. The magic of compound interest will do the rest for you.
* **“Don’t lose money”** – Warren Buffett & treat every dollar as an investment.

I believe that beating the market is possible if you are patient and willing to invest time. After all, the business world is like a car race. In the last quarter of the race, it becomes more evident who might win, and your odds can be calculated with minimized risk exposure. Then you invest in the top-performing racers and still reap much of the benefits.

Keep in mind that most stocks underperform the market. The outsized gains of a few winners are pushing your portfolio higher and make up for any losses on the way.

## Cash

Oh, sweet cash sitting ducks in my account, what am I going to do with you? At current rates of around 1% (if even) it would take 70 years to double my money. By that time it is more likely that I am buried 6 feet underground. I wouldn't even get to experience my slim gains.

Yet there is some upside to holding a percentage of your overall portfolio in cash. Besides, you can’t pay your expenses off by handing out your stocks. Holding some cash is in both active and passive investing approaches detrimental. I advise holding approximately 5-15% of cash as it allows you to:

* Leave your portfolio in peace
* Remain calm during market volatility
* Jump in when prices are low and be opportunistic in the markets

Buying stocks in times of recession has historically brought about outsized gains for investors. It is worth remembering, the more it hurts holding some cash in market booms the more likely you will profit from a swift down-market. The best time to hold cash is when it really hurts to do so. Holding cash allows you to be prepared, and you don’t have to worry about timing the market.

I've been a lurker and got some nice ideas form here, so thanks for that. Now it's the time for me to give something back. 

I discovered in the weekend that Magnachip is being bought up in a 29$ per share deal while the price of the stock is just 24$ per share.

The deal has a definitive agreement and ""The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of shareholder and regulatory approvals"". Also ""The transaction is fully backed by equity commitments and not contingent on any financing conditions. ""  


The way I see it it's a 20% win in less than 6 months (they said second half of the year, so most probably will be sometime September-October-November). The risks are small:

Shareholders might oppose- but this is highly unlikely given the company is 78% own by institutions and the board of directors approves the deal.  
Regulatory things might kick in: this again I think it's low because we are talking about a 1 bil company, not something the size of ARM.

* “I can’t find any period in history where monetary and fiscal policy were this out of step with the economic circumstances, not one,” the chair and CEO of Duquesne Family Office said.
* Though he agreed with the early steps the Fed took during the pandemic, he said the policies have continued for too long.

Federal Reserve policies aimed at keeping markets and the economy afloat during the pandemic could end up threatening the long-term health of the U.S. dollar, investing magnate Stanley Druckenmiller told CNBC on Tuesday.

The chairman and CEO of Duquesne Family Office said the Fed’s insistence on holding interest rates down and buying trillions in bonds even though markets are thriving and the economy is booming is a long-term risk.

“I can’t find any period in history where monetary and fiscal policy were this out of step with the economic circumstances, not one,” Druckenmiller said during a”Squawk Box” interview.

Though he does not take issue with the Fed’s initial actions to combat the pandemic-related threats, Druckenmiller said the central bank has kept its foot on the accelerator too long.

He asserted that the Fed has continued its policies to help underwrite the spending binge in Congress, which has allocated more than $5 trillion in stimulus and is contemplating trillions more in infrastructure-related spending.

Over the long haul, he said, the policies and the heavy debts and deficits they support will threaten the dollar’s standing as the world’s reserve currency. That status means the dollar is accepted for transactions and as a store of wealth anywhere and is widely held by central banks around the world.

“If they want to do all this and risk our reserve currency status, risk an asset bubble blowing up, so be it. But I think we ought to at least have a conversation about it,” Druckenmiller said.

“If we’re going to monetize our debt and we’re going to enable more and more of this spending, that’s why I’m worried now for the first time that within 15 years we lose reserve currency status and of course all the unbelievable benefits that have accrued with it,” he added.

To be sure, others have warned in the past that Fed excesses could threaten the dollar, but the greenback has retained its position in the world.

One reason for that is there have been no other viable alternatives introduced.

Druckemiller has entertained the thought that a challenge could come from the crypto world. He said in the CNBC interview that the ultimate solution could be “some kind of ledger system invented by some kids from MIT or Stanford” though he conceded that “I don’t know what it will be.”

However, he noted that in the early days of the pandemic, other foreign governments already voiced their concerns about the dollar by selling Treasurys, the opposite of what normally would happen in a crisis when ultra-safe U.S. debt is generally seen as a haven.

Indeed, foreign holdings of government bills, notes and bonds actually have decreased, falling by $127 billion or nearly 2% over the past year, according to Treasury Department data. Foreigners hold nearly one-third of the public portion of the $28.2 trillion U.S. debt.

Druckenmiller said central banks have been the root of a lack of confidence in dollar stability.

“The problem has been clearly identified. It’s [Fed Chair[ Jerome Powell and the rest of the world’s central bankers,” he said. “There’s a lack of trust.”

Druckenmiller’s comments came a day after he and Duquesne partner Christian Broda said in an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal that Powell “needs to recognize the likelihood of future political pressures on the Fed and stop enabling financial and market excesses.”

Similarly, former New York Fed President William Dudley wrote in Bloomberg News that markets are underestimating how much the central bank will have to raise interest rates in the years ahead to keep up with the inflation it is trying to foster.

The Fed itself, in its semiannual Financial Stability Report last week, said it worried about risks coming from soaring asset prices.

Druckenmiller told CNBC he has “no doubt whatsoever that we are in a raging mania in all assets.”

What was she doing before Ark? I have been able to dig into her past performance and the results of which are below.

&nbsp;

**Quick summary**

-   She has a long history of running funds that fit under ""discovery growth"" or ""global thematic"" styles.

-   Cathie has a **great track record outperforming the S&P 500**, but much of this has been due to outperformance of growth style. Also, this assumes you catch the very early cycles of her outperformance.

-   When compared to category style, almost all of Cathie's major **outperforming** years come during special periods in the market cycle, particularly in the periods following a market crash. With one other period of great performance during the 2017 BTC bubble craze**.**

-   Outside of those special events, Cathie's funds generally **underperform** equivalent style peers on a year-by-year basis.

-   She has a history of **leaving a fund during or** **following a period of underperformance**, then ""rebooting"" in another fund. This includes a short stint in **a hedge fund that lost over 80% of it's AUM**.

&nbsp;

Before getting into the deep dive, a quick note on benchmarks. Cathie's investment style fits into one of two flavors: **US growth** and **global growth**. The S&P 500 is not an appropriate benchmark at all for a growth-oriented or global oriented fund. Instead, for the years available, I will benchmark her to the Russell 1000 Growth and MSCI World Large Cap Index, as these fit her investment universe and demonstrate whether an investor would have been better off with a passive index fund.

Additionally, I'm going to compare her performance to some matching T Rowe Price Funds. Why T Rowe Price? First, their security selection universe is similar to Cathie Woods: they tend to prefer growth-oriented companies (i.e. think Amazon rather than Phillip Morris). Secondary, they have been around for a while and their funds have history dating back earlier than the indices I will be using.

Finally, for another reference point I will benchmark against Yahoo Finance's category averages for years where no index data is easily available. 

&nbsp;

In Summary:

-   To benchmark her ""discovery growth"" funds, I am going to use the **i-shares Russell 1000 Growth Index (IWF)** (subject to years available) as well as **T Rowe Price's New Horizon Fund (PRNHX).**

-   To benchmark her ""global "" fund, I am going to use **Vanguard Total World (VT)** (subject to years available) and **T Rowe Price's Global Stock Fund (PRGSX)**.

-   For years where no index data is easily available, I will instead use Yahoo Finance's category averages (average of of active fund performance, after fees).

&nbsp;

**1980-1998 (Jennison Associates)**

This is the one period for which I could not find any performance data, as there are only a handful of surviving funds from that period. She was apparently a portfolio manager and chief economist. I tried looking up fund history on the SEC website but could not find anywhere she is listed as a manager, even after searching shareholder reports for the period. It's possible whichever funds she worked on are no longer around...so unfortunately we need to skip this period.

&nbsp;

**1998-2001 (Tupelo Capital Services)**

Cathie co-founded this hedge fund in 1998..right as the dotcom bubble was building steam. ARK's company profile boasts that she managed $800 million in assets in 2000. Interesting that they give this figure for the very height of the market bubble. In 2001, as the market bubble crashes, Cathie leaves Tupelo Capital.

Unfortunately there is no accurate performance history for this hedge fund, but I have found AUM filings from the SEC.

In Q4 1999, the fund's AUM reached $1.0 billion.

Source (<https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-00-001292/>)

In Q1 2000, the fund's AUM then reached $1.3 billion.

Source (<https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-00-005389/>)

By Q4 2000, the AUM shrank to ~$800 million: matching Cathie's stated figures.

Source (<https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-01-001535/>)

Finally, by the end of Q1 2001, the AUM shrank to ~$200 million.

Source (<https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-01-502496/>)

In other words**, the fund's AUM shrank roughly 80% over 2000 and 2001**. Note that this would have been due to a combination of asset losses as well as investors pulling out, so it's not possible to know how much of that is due to actual equity losses.

By comparison, T Rowe's Global Equity Fund lost 17% across 2000-2001, roughly in line with the category average. Unfortunately Vanguard's Total World index (VT) did not exist during this timeframe.

&nbsp;

**2001-2013 (Alliance Bernstein)**

After Cathie left Tupelo Capital Services, she joined Alliance Bernstein. During her tenure she managed three funds that I could find:

-   AB Discovery Growth (**CHCIX**): A discovery/growth oriented fund.

-   AB Sustainable Global Thematic Fund (**ALTFX**)

-   AB Strategy Research Portfolio: Note that this is a Separately Managed Account (SMA) not an open mutual fund. I will use the acronym **ABSRP**.

All further sources will be at the bottom.

ABSRP beats it's category as the 2001 recession unfolds, but loses to PRNHX. Note that Cathie joined some time in 2001, so it's uknown how much of a contributing factor she was during this period.

**2014-2020: Ark Years**

For the Ark era, I am going to use ARKK to evaluate her performance. I'm using ARKK because first and foremost it is her flagship fund, and secondly because her specialty funds, while interesting, are nearly impossible to benchmark against. For another comparison, I am also going to add another passive fund to the mix, Vanguard's VGT (Technology Index), in addition to the Russell 1000 Growth.

&nbsp;

**2014: N/A**

There is no full-year history for ARKK in 2014.

&nbsp;

**2015: Cathie UNDERPERFORMS T Rowe, UNDERPERFORMS Passive**

Benchmarks I am using for ARKK are IWF (IShares Russell Growth 2000) and VGT (Vanguard Technology ETF) as a secondary benchmark. It turns out to not make a difference whether a year is a underperform or an outperform. 

-   **ARKK**: 3.76%

-   VGT: 5.02%

-   IWF: 5.50%

-   PRNHX: 4.50%

&nbsp;

**2016: Cathie UNDERPERFORMS T Rowe, UNDERPERFORMS Passive**

-   **ARKK**: -1.96%

-   VGT: 13.73%

-   IWF: 7.01%

-   PRNHX: 7.79%

&nbsp;

**2017: Cathie OUTPERFORMS T Rowe, OUTPERFORMS Passive**

-   **ARKK**: 87.38%

-   VGT: 37.07%

-   IWF: 29.96%

-   PRNHX: 31.49%

Summary: This is without a doubt the breakout year for Cathie Wood. How was this done? Can you guess what was the biggest contributor to her outperformance? Hint - it wasn't an equity holding. A position in Bitcoin Investment Trust is by far her top contributor, netting her 635, 748, 655 basis points of compounding outperformance in Q2, Q3, and Q4. Check out their quarterly reports and you'll see it's not even close. Note that the contribution of this is more than simply the compounding of 1.0635 * 1.0748 * 1.065..because this compounding is based upon the base of all assets. In other words..I estimate her actual returns without bitcoin would have been about 57%. Still great, but brings it down a bit more towards earth.

Q1 Return: 19.2%

Q2 Return 20.9% (14.55 without BTC)

Q3 Return 18.3% (10.82 without BTC)

Q4 Estimated Return 9.9% (3.35 without BTC)

**56.3% return without BTC (estimated)**

**87.4% return with BTC included.**

2020 bears no explanation. We all lived through the fun in the market last year. In case it isn't obvious, her biggest contributor for the year was Tesla, however there were many others as well and overall it was a much more balanced return profile versus that of 2017.

&nbsp;

**My take on ARK**

The following comes directly from ARK's own FAQ:\
""ARK's funds are fully invested and do not hold a material amount of cash. ARK generally will not use cash in a tactical manner.""

<https://ark-funds.com/help-center/what-is-the-typical-range-for-the-cash-position>

Let me explain in layman speak what this means. Here the algorithm Cathie follows to buy or sell:

-   When Cathie receives inflows, she buys

-   When Cathie receives outflows, she sells

Sounds a lot like the algorithm for a passive fund. You see, unlike most active funds...Cathie is not tactically using cash nor thinking of limiting inflows..even as she now sits with many billion AUM, and continuing to pump money into existing positions.

Unlike Cathie, **top active shops tend to hold higher cash positions during times of market euphoria and close funds when they are performing** ***too*** **well**. The exception to this are mega-cap blue chip funds, but Cathie is not running a mega-cap blue chip fund. The T Rowe Funds in my benchmarks for example are currently either closed or restricted to new inflows. Fidelity has done the same with very successful small or mid-cap funds. Let me quickly summarize what IMO are some of the best virtues of a good active manager:

-   Keep cash onhand and deploy it only when there is a reasonable risk/reward tradeoff.

-   Sell if the risk/reward tradeoff is no longer to the best interest of your clients, even if this means selling to a cash position.

-   If your cash grows too large or if your fund performs too well..you should consider closing the fund as otherwise it attracts short-minded performance chasers.

-   If there is a great buying opportunity (i.e. a market crash) and your fund is closed, you should open your fund to solicit new inflows.

-   You should try to keep your Assets Under Management (AUM) small if possible. The larger your AUM, the more difficult it is to make a winning bet on a small cap. Let's say for example you wanted to bet 5% of your portfolio on San Jose Water Company (SJW), an infrastructure holding of mine. Well...their total market cap is less then $2 billion. If your AUM was $100 billion, you'd need to buy the entire company outright just to make a small dent in the portfolio.

-   Your marketing to your clients should be reasonable and not overpromise. Telling your clients ""your goal is to beat the S&P 500 on a risk adjusted basis"" is fine as long as you are clear about risks involved.

I do not see Cathie following any of the above. Instead I am seeing a combination of dangerous behaviors:

-   Actively soliciting more inflows even when total AUM across Ark funds exceeded $50 billion. This is forcing more purchases into existing overcrowded positions.

-   Advertising that ARKK should double your investment in 5 years.

-   Regularly putting out videos, promotional materials, interviews, etc. promoting the house holdings with price targets significantly above most industry targets.

I do not believe Cathie is acting in her investors best interests. Intentionally or not, I believe Ark is essentially a pump scheme:

-   Buy companies with a marketable story and small revenue base but large revenue growth.

-   Promote the companies heavily: sell investors on the story.

-   Solicit inflows, use to buy more into those positions...sometimes owning up to 10% of the company. My theory is that this in itself is jacking up the price of those companies...

-   Sit back and **watch the stock's price grow at a faster rate than revenue growth**. This is not sustainable.

-   Until...well until what? You now hold a basket of companies trading at very high P/S ratios. Some of them might become the next Google, but surely they all won't become the next Google. You can try selling them to some greater fool, but good luck doing that with 10s of billions in AUM.

&nbsp;

Edit: lots of posts about how ARK cannot control inflows because it's an ETF. This is true and not Cathie's fault, but nonetheless it's a problem...or at least it's fair to say it's a flaw in the structure of active or concentrated ETFs. ARK is now suffering from the big AUM problem. Too much capital to chase after too few opportunities, victim of its own success.

Billionaire investor Sam Zell is seeing inflation everywhere, and has bought gold as a hedge -- something he says he used to knock others for doing.

“Obviously one of the natural reactions is to buy gold,” he said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “It feels very funny because I’ve spent my career talking about why would you want to own gold? It has no income, it costs to store. And yet, when you see the debasement of the currency, you say, what am I going to hold on to?”

Zell, 79, said he’s concerned not only about the U.S. dollar but other countries printing money as well, and questioned whether inflation will be transitory, as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated last week.

“Oh boy, we’re seeing it all over the place,” Zell said of inflation. “You read about lumber prices, but we’re seeing it in all of our businesses. The obvious bottlenecks in the supply chain arena are pushing up prices. It’s very reminiscent of the ‘70s.”

While gold is an attractive investment, opportunities in fossil fuels are not, said Zell, who in 2019 agreed to set up a joint venture with Tom Barrack Jr.’s Colony Capital Inc. to invest in oil and gas.

“Right now, oil and gas is not priced to reflect the risk of what’s going on, whether it be in the EV world, a climate changed world,” he said. “As recently as a couple of years ago I thought the risk-reward ratio was appropriate. It’s clearly become very inappropriate as our political situation has changed.”

Zell also said he’s concerned about renewable energy undermining the reliability of power grids, pointing to the recent blackouts in California and Texas.

In real estate, there are plenty of questions about what demand will look like over the next couple years in the office, lodging and retail sectors, Zell also said in the interview.

“Everybody’s worried about going back to work and office-space occupancy. I don’t think that’s really an issue,” he said. “The problem is that, before the pandemic, we were dealing with an oversupply of office space. Obviously the pandemic hasn’t reduced that oversupply and has probably encouraged it accordingly.”

Stores also present challenges, he said, given that the U.S. already had more retail space per person than the rest of the world before Covid-19, and shoppers increased their reliance on e-commerce while stuck at home during the pandemic.

“Street retail today is like a falling knife, and you don’t know how far it goes down,” he said. While that “doesn’t mean the best malls aren’t going to perform,” there’s a “huge amount of real estate that’s going to have to be reprogrammed in one form or another.”

The challenges faced by hotels are more of a temporary problem over the next three to four years, Zell said. “We will see a slow recovery in business travel,” he said. “In the interim period of time, it’s going to be a slow recovery, and hotels are big overhead things and running them at less-than-optimum occupancy is a very expensive scenario.”",Billionaire Sam Zell Buys Gold With Inflation ‘Reminiscent of the ‘70s’,,

When (if) we get this pandemic under control there will be a lot of older folks moving out of their homes and moving into senior living communities.  

I had been calling around looking for a place for my folks, and I have been getting bombarded with sales people looking to fill vacancies at the senior living facilities.  In talking with them a bit they were saying that they have quite a lot of available capacity.

So if a lot of seniors put their houses on the market, will it just be some price relief, or will it be a bubble bursting?",How bubble like is todays real-estate market?,,
266,2021-05-12 15:42:34,t3_narr02,narr02,investing,"As the cloud & big data continues to grow, as well as social media & 4k/8k video, data storage is becoming more important than ever.

Large social media sites take in a tremendous amount of data each day. This storage must not only be stored, but stored with redundancy as well as backups(usually to tape). Major sites such as Facebook and YouTube keep content that is over a decade old. Over time, the drives holding this content will fail and need to be replaced, leading to growing recurring demand as the size of the platform grows.

The need for storage has been growing for decades, but innovation in storage density and intense competition has limited profitability in the market in the past. That being said, there is reason to believe that the growth in storage density may stop keeping up with the growth in storage needs.

There is also reason to believe that transient growth in storage demand may drive higher Q2 earnings. A new crypto, Chia, has gobbled up about 3.5 Exabytes worth of storage in the past 3 weeks, growing at a rate of about 0.2 EiB per day(and rising). https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/netspace

For reference, about 288 Exabytes worth of hard drives were shipped in Q1 2021 https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hdd-shipments-in-q1-2021

Chia network size can be considered a lagging indicator for unexpected drive shipments. Generally, it can take a few weeks between when a drive is purchased and when it's actually accounted for on the network, as it takes time for it to be shipped, set up, and plotted. Chia wasn't even listed on exchanges until a week ago, so most of the growth seen is prior to Chia even having a price. At current prices, mining is incredibly profitable, with a $500 14 TB drive estimated to produce about $30 per day, and using very little power. So even if the network grows 10x to 40 Exabytes, it's still producing $3/day at current prices.

I have seen many anecdotes of drive shortages over the past couple weeks. Reviewing sites like Amazon, I have also seen high capacity drives go out of stock or require lead times of a few weeks.

This may be a bit reminiscent of GPU shortages among Nvidia and AMD as miners seek to buy up anything they can.

If we project continued growth at 0.25 Exabytes a day in unexpected demand from proof of storage over the next 48 days, plus the 3.5 Exabytes added since April 20(leaving out first 3 weeks in quarter as they were likely logged last quarter), that's about 15 Exabytes to be added in Q2 that are not part of normal usage, or about an extra 5% of Q1 demand.

What's perhaps most interesting is the impact this could have on margins. Unlike the GPUs used to mine which are consumer devices, the devices used for mining Chia includes enterprise grade hardware. Prices in the drive market are more flexible at the manufacturer level, and currently have much lower margins. If proof of storage currencies cause a drive shortage, it could have a significant impact on margins.

Seagate is also in a position to profit from this, but I'm a bit more worried about them as hard drive shipments have been on a long term decline and they aren't diversified into SSDs/flash like Western Digital is.",Western Digital - The Next Nvidia,,
267,2021-05-12 16:12:27,t3_nash4a,nash4a,investing,"Hi all, 

I was thinking about Ark funds and wasn't sure if I wanted to split it up between all of the individual funds or just keep it simple and go with ARKK. I wanted to know if ARKK was a decent representation of all of the individual funds. Kind of like if it was ""an ETF of all Ark funds"".

So I brought in all of the holdings into excel and conditional formatted for overlapping holdings. I then summed up the weighting from the ARKK fund to see how much of ARKK is comprised of holdings from each fund. Below are the results. 

ARKK shares X% holdings with X fund:

ARKQ: 24.59%

ARKW: 72.20%

ARKG: 30.63%

ARKF: 35.40%

ARKX: 6.53%

PRNT: 3.43%

IZRL: 1.4%

Obviously there's a lot of overlap so these numbers are going to add up to over 100%. 

But I was very surprised to see that ARKK is 72% similar to ARKW. Also surprised to see it's only 6.53% similar to ARKX, but that makes sense given it's the newest one. 

Anyway thought this was a fun exercise and figured I'd share if anyone else were interested.

I'm going to break down the numbers, and tell you why you're worrying your heads off over nothing. Precursor: Things haven't significantly changed, inflation is no more than it was last month.

#The month on month data:

There's a lot of information to take in, so I'll do my best to explain it in the comments, to anyone confused by what I'm saying. A lot of the explanations are very simple but here goes:

- All items less food and energy account for 79.125 weighting on the whole CPI. Digging into the data, the more heavily weighted portions is commodities less food and energy commodities (which carrys 20 weight). Furniture and bedding increased 2.1% (0.94 Weight). Living room, kitchen and dining furniture accounted for most of this (2.8% change), which can be attributed to the increasingly high lumber prices. 

- Transport commodities less motor fuel was helped push this number up quite a bit, seeing a 4.3% change, which is a 7 weighting. These include new and used vehicles, of which used vehicles sales solely drived up, with a change of 10% which can be attributed to the semiconductor shortage.

- Recreation commodities were up 1.2%, with a weighting of 1.9, with video and audio products essentially carrying this number above average with the help of recreational reading material (1.5%), toys (2.7%), information technology commodities (3.6%), and miscellaneous personal goods (2.1%).

As you can see, a lot of these either involved lumber, or semiconductors. These were all the sectors above the average, and a couple below, the rest managed to pull the full percentage of commodities less energy and food commodities down to a 2%.

The next sector we need to look into is Services less energy services (59 weighting).

- No big increases here in heavily weighted areas. Notable changes were a 7.6% change in Lodging away from home (0.9 weighting), a 10.2% change in Airline fares (0.59 weighting), and a 3.4% change in admissions (0.664 weighting) 

As you can see, this CPI didn't give any clear indiction of inflation. Each significant rise that significantly affected the CPI could be explained by the lumber and semiconductor shortage. There is so much fearmongering going around right now, that I felt like I had to put this out there, because clearly people aren't too willing to look deep into this. 

#The Year on Year CPI data:

If you really think this is evidence of inflation, you're not thinking straight. You're measuring from the bottom of the market, just after the pandemic became real, to where we stand now. 

Anyways, throw any questions my way, or you can find the CPI data if you think I've made all these numbers up. 

TLDR: No inflation (Well there is inflation, obviously, but you get what I mean), lumber and semiconductor shortage help to explain everything.",The Latest CPI numbers can be explained by the Lumber and Semiconductor shortage,,

Right now I'm overweight in USD as that's where I have most of my non-short-term savings. I'm wondering, however, if it wouldn't make sense to exchange some of these dollars for euros and hold those instead.

Why?  Inflation is eating at USD right now, and I think the ECB (plus EU fiscal policy) will be less aggressive than the Fed and the US government, thus keeping EUR inflation comparatively low.  Thus, inflation will eat at USD but not at EUR.  Any thoughts on my analysis here?

As I understand it, inflation especially hyper inflation isn't a bad thing at all for a stock holder.
If your fiat of choice evaporates you wanna hold real values, like real estate or art, etc.
Why? Because they hold an intrinsic value that's not bound to a currency. And this is also true for stock's. So why fear it? 
I mean if you hold a large chunk of cash you should be scared of inflation and get rid of it.
Selling stocks because of inflation fears looks counter intuitive to me.

The only things I see here are that high inflation means the end of the endless money printing. Okay yeah get that. But at some point this has to stop anyways..

And maby a high inflation might make it more difficult for companies to make profits but that's all I can think of.

https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ltkij3/criteo_crto_why_one_of_the_biggest_adtech_players/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Though to be completely honest, the stock performance in the past 3 months hasn’t been as what I expected - mostly due to overall small cap tech getting crushed from asset rotation to reopening plays - but the company has been holding up pretty well against it’s peers. Criteo is more or less up around 5% in the past 3 months (15% off from recent intraday peak), while most of other small caps adtech players are down 40-60% from 3 months ago (even TTD is down almost 40%). 

I continue to feel Criteo is undervalued as a stock compared to its competitors and remain confident with the way the company executes their turnaround plan. For those of you who are not familiar with Criteo, they are making most of their revenue from Retargeting (80% of revenue) with the rest of 20% comes from higher growth areas. Here are the latest facts:

- Criteo is trading at around 2.5x ex-TAC revenue, while many of its competitors are trading at 10-30x (even after they came down by -40/-60%). 

- Retargeting which had been declared by most investment community actually expanded in Q1’21 (+4% for Criteo), even though travel industry hasn’t picked up and faces significant headwind from privacy regulations. 

- Criteo’s New Solutions (20% revenue) is growing at 60% per year with no signs of slowing down, helped by a shift to ecommerce by major offline retailers (Criteo is working with Target, Home Depot, Carrefour and many others) in which Criteo helped them to monetize their website. 

- Criteo has thousands of repeat brands clients (P&G, Adidas, etc), which could use Criteo’s New Solutions hence expanding its Target Addressable Market (TAM) exponentially to more than $70B. 

- Google/Apple privacy updates will benefit those adtech companies that already owns 1st Party data, in this case Criteo is very well positioned. Criteo’s ecommerce reach is around $2B/day and enjoys exclusive access to major retailers/publishers. 

- Criteo is financially sound - it has $600m cash, generating more than $120m free cash flow per year (which is going to increase if New Solutions continue to grow, cost cutting work is also on the way) and with minimal debt. The company is having a buyback program of up to $100m this year, which has been used by $5m in Q1. 

Because of the above reasons, I believe Criteo provides good risk/reward as an investment.",Criteo Earnings Update - Progressing in the right direction,,

The Chinese population growth slowing is seen as a bad sign indicated by the decline in Alibaba stock price the day this was announced. However, an important thing to note is that the Chinese are not only getting richer but the Chinese middle class seems to continue to grow which is the more important number ([Yahoo!Finance](https://news.yahoo.com/jack-ma-makes-rare-visit-123439015.html), [St. Louis Fed](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2018/january/income-living-standards-china#:~:text=However%2C%20since%20the%20measure%20is%20based%20on%20the,median%20income%20but%20far%20below%20the%20world%20average))*^(Important because this directly impacts the market that the company is in)*

**Risks**

Slower growth metrics and loss of market share from companies such as Pinduoduo and JD.com

Dark clouds of the antitrust regulations and potential future regulatory concerns

Tensions between US and China relationships may serve as risky for Chinese companies/holdings in the United States.

**Note on investing in China**

A common point that I see on Alibaba or any Chinese ADR is that China can nullify any value of what you own at any moment simply because they don't like a company. While there are some elements of truth to this, intuitively speaking, this wouldn't make sense for China to do since they're trying to welcome MORE foreign investment.

In addition, there are many mutual funds, ETFs, and individuals that have exposure to China than before as referenced by the Alipay and Yahoo scandal ([Source](https://news.yahoo.com/news/yahoo-alibaba-softbank-reach-agreement-alipay-160402485.html)) which would be counterproductive to the point above.

To cut the knees of their technology companies even further as they're positioning themselves to be competitive to the United States wouldn't make sense. A recent notable event was the introduction of the digital Yuan for Alipay which indicates Alibaba is aligned with CCP values and will continue to show their willingness to work with them ([Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/10/china-digital-yuan-alibabas-ant-joins-e-cny-currency-trial.html))

**Conclusion**

Alibaba seems to have put the antitrust issues behind them with the Alibaba's growth is slowing as indicated by analyst reported estimates and current earnings. Although this may seem alarming, Alibaba is continuously reinvesting into growth opportunities which can hurt their short term bottom line. The growing Chinese middle class and disposable income per capita points to more good signs than bad for Alibaba. The middle class and income numbers are far more important than overall population numbers. Regulatory concerns aren't over for Alibaba in its entirety but the business is very solid and they've shown a willingness to comply with any new introduction to Chinese regulatory policy.

I have recently gotten into covered calls because I like the risk reward that they offer. 

Let’s break down what covered calls mean. 

A covered call is when you buy 100 shares of stock and then sell a call contract. 

Covered means that you own the 100 shares so you are not using leverage since you own all shares of the contract. 

Calls are options that allow a buyer to collect profits after the price hits the strike price. 

When you do covered calls you sell these options on the options market. 

When you sell an option you get paid for the option to buy the stock at your strike price. I like setting my strike a few dollars above the current price. 

When the deadline of the option passes this contract expires. If the stock price is below the strike price then you keep all your shares plus the cost of the option. If it expires above the strike price then you give that money back to the person who purchased your option. 

Even if you have to pay someone that purchased your option that is a good thing as it means that you have recieved maximum profit on your trade. 

Worst case scenario the stock price drops. In this scenario you would be better off than the guy that just held 100 shares because you are also holding 100 shares but unlike a normal stock buyer you were able to collect the premium from when you sold the option. 


I love covered calls",Let’s discuss covered calls.,,

Either to dampen volatility, provide something to rebalance against during the equity dips, improve risk-adjusted returns due to low correlations to lever an optimal portfolio...

This is everything I've heard, but I'm just believing it less and less.

I did a quick test here just on [google sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t7xOheId6-4rdjC6HHa-hemlfH7u6SZGT9d6i8cXVYU/edit?usp=sharing). In short here is the performance of $100,000 (dates are rough, not the definitive start and end dates of the period in the titles)

So obviously, having an allocation towards bonds helped during times of crisis, especially in the drawdown period, but not so much in the long run.

Surprisingly, even the added value of being able to rebalancing isn't so definitive versus holding. During prolonged downturns, you're rebalancing more into equities which continue to drop further and faster than your bond component. During recoveries, you may be rebalancing away from equity momentum.

Finally, if the bond allocation is only better than 100% equities during downturns, and if the long-run has 100% equities outperforming, isn't trying to have a bond component for the option to rebalance during downturns almost akin to market timing?

Is the only reason for bond allocation at this point volatility dampening effects? if that's the case should we be looking to cash? or even less correlated assets? or more diversification?

If the drawdowns didn't affect your ability to afford your life, i.e. no need to draw on even 20% of the portfolio for the next 10 years, should we just be 100% equities? Presuming the stomach allows it?

I know this might have been a roundabout way going at what we already have a rule of thumb responses for. ""no need for it if young and high enough risk tolerance"" or ""(120 - age)% in equities, rest in bonds"", but I'm having a hard time seeing even the slightest benefit to it. I haven't shown it here, but it's hard to even create a return/volatility optimal portfolio with it given recent data. Correlations are not as low as they need to be. If you really were a 70-year-old retiree, I would even say bonds don't have enough of a return premium relative to their risk over cash.

I would post this on /r/changemyview if it weren't so topic-specific. Why do you / would you include bonds in your portfolio?

Edit: so just to clarify, I’m not making the trivial point that bonds return less than stocks in the long run, or that they reduce volatility to your tolerance level - I’m just asking for the “pros” to owning them. The argument for being able to rebalance was the most compelling one for me (especially because I don’t have an income to dollar cost average), but I’m noting even that benefit isn’t super strong. 

I might look into the retiree case. I imagine another variable is ratio of expenses to portfolio. It would be interesting to see survival rates of different allocations on a 2 way axis against different expense/portfolio ratios and duration of living off portfolio. Maybe I’ll sim it out later. 

As a side note, despite this post, I do have a fixed income allocation. Granted, it’s levered such that the yield on cash is about 5% (it used to be as high as 12% on investment grade corporates).",The role of bonds in a portfolio,,

There are a number of other suggestions in the comments of similarly ill-fated IPOs which I could not add for brevity's sake.

11 of the biggest COVID tech IPOs in 7 different categories (cloud, crypto, gig economy, app economy, e-commerce, fintech, and real estate), all crashed following stellar public offerings. Prices rounded to the nearest digit.

* SNOW went down from $430 ATH in Dec to 314 in Feb to 232 on Apr 30 and 185 today.
* COIN sunk from ATH of 429 to 250 after narrowly missing earnings expectations today. At one point on the day of its IPO, retail traders were lapping up COIN for as much as $**429**. I will note though that BTC crashed yday for those unaware. As if ARKK bagholders weren't hurting enough!
* DASH crashed from ATH of $256 in late Feb to $110 yday before reporting a bigger-than-expected loss today. They're up 8% in after-hours.
* BMBL halved from $85 ATH to $39 after beating expectations yday.
* WISH crashed from ATH of 33 to 8 after earnings yday.
* CPNG is down from ATH of 69 to 31 after reporting a higher than expected adjusted loss yday.
* Qualtrics (XM) crashed from ATH of $57 to 29 today.
* SPAC merger OPEN crashed from $39 in Feb to its all-time low of 11 today after Tuesday earnings.
* ABNB crashed from $220 on Apr 28 to $133 after-hours today, down from its ATH of $217 on Feb 11 and up from its ATL of $125. The company announced today that their net loss tripled.
* AFRM is down from ATH of $147 in Feb to 47 today.
* Deliveroo (LON: ROO) crashed from ATH of £3.9 on IPO day to £2.3 on Apr 26 and trades at £2.4 today.

The one newly public tech company that seems to have weathered the storm is Roblox, which reported great earnings on Monday.

But it's not just tech companies that IPOd in 2020-2021. Hot 2019 IPOs Lyft, Uber, Pinterest, and Snap - which - except for Lyft, all reached their ATHs during COVID - saw significant gains during the pandemic, have also crashed since the end of April.

* LYFT tanked from $63 on Apr 28 to 46 today. Previously, Lyft dipped below $23 (ATH is close to $80) three times during COVID, most recently in Oct.
* In the same time period, UBER crashed from $58 to $44.
* PINS is down from 78 to 55 since Apr 27.
* SNAP dipped below $50 from 70 from Feb 23 to Mar 29 and is trading at 50 again today.

These companies aren't just sliding in after-hours or on the day after reporting earnings, we're looking at a prolonged downward trend over weeks either preceding or following earnings.","A reckoning for tech: 2020-21 IPOs Coinbase, DoorDash, Bumble, Wish, and Coupang record all-time low stock prices this week",,
283,2021-05-14 07:03:54,t3_nc2i7c,nc2i7c,investing,"Wondering what everyone's thoughts are on the upcoming Exxon annual vote that's being contested by a group called Engine No 1? They are seeking to break up the current board and vote in 4 of their own candidates in order to push the company into a greener direction. To grab a quote off their [website](https://reenergizexom.com/), ""ExxonMobil lacks a plan to create shareholder value in a world that seeks to decarbonize"".

I'm not really a seasoned investor, but I generally agree that Exxon stock has been underperforming for years partly because of increased demand and feasibility of cleaner energy, and the end of the petroleum energy's dominance is encroaching (we're inevitably going to run out of the stuff). The only ""green"" move by Exxon has been to invest heavily in carbon capture and storage; which is fine, but I'd like to see Exxon soon put together a solid plan to gradually transition out of strictly petroleum and get more involved in wind, solar, and other renewables - I'm most likely being really naive here.

In theory I like Engine No 1's objective but I guess my main concern is how effective or sincere they would be in their push for green and cleaner energy? Maybe they're just some investment firm using all this as an opportunity to place their own members on Exxon's board who'll just cash in and ultimately won't fulfill their stated objectives? I honestly don't know, and Engine No 1 probably won't get the votes they're looking for anyway. I'm anticipating that at some point I'm going to eventually divest from Exxon while putting more of my money into clean energy ETFs or something.

Anyone want to share their opinions or insights on any of this?

tldr, I'm having a crisis of confidence in buy-and-hold index investing strategy

**Backstory:**

I'm 38 and live in the USA. I'm employed, and I make the median national income. I want to accrue wealth over the long term. I don't know that I have an accurate understanding of my risk tolerance. I think generally I am very cautious. Before yesterday I was about 70% equities, 15 bonds, 15 cash. I just sold off a lot of my stock. I'm waiting for the account to settle to see my new allocation, but I'm certainly under 50% stocks at this time. I have no debts.

I have been a buy & hold index fund investor for the 20 years of my adult life. It always sort of bothered me that I didn't understand the underlying mechanisms of the markets I was investing in. At some point in the last decade I learned about the Schiller p/e index and thought ""hmm, this doesn't seem good..."" I read *Random Walk,* and I think I understood most of it.

**The Bug Out:**

Recently, I heard a Grantham interview and read some Hussman, and their gloomy prognostication really struck a chord with my natural inclination towards pessimism. They say current prices are unthethered from the underlying assets and and that this is true across all sectors of the market. My friends and the forums are full people  throwing money at speculative investments (crypto, SPAC, etc). My elders are telling me to blindly invest in an index fund and forget about it, because 'historic returns, don't miss the market's big days, it worked for them, etc.'

My armchair diagnosis is that there are a lot of people like me that are blindly investing in broad index funds that could care less about the underlying value of the assets as long as the price keeps going up. I suspect at some time in the future we'll look back and see that index funds were a craze like any other and laugh at the certainly we currently feel that these assets will return 6-8% on average until the end of time. Looking at you Vanguard (who recently told me that a 'normal asset allocation' was 90-95% stocks...hmm). I also think we'll look back and see that the last trick the boomers played on us was propping up their asset valuations with Fed policy and leaving us to hold the bag.

Worst of all, it doesn't seem like anyone I speak these concerns to (friends, family, investment advisors) is really taking them seriously or even hearing them. Am I turning into a flat-earther? Is the king wearing any clothes?

**What Now?**

I've been told you shouldn't try to time the market, and I've read the explainers about how I'm likely to mistime by selling below the peak, buying before the trough, and missing out on gains while out of the market. Frankly, I'm at a point where I don't believe in the market at all. Is not believing in the market at all the same as timing it?

I've heard that market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. I've also read that by definition there is never greater certainty in the market than the day before the bubble pops.

I'm not sure I can just put all of my money in an index fund and sleep at night.  I have the following questions. Have some of you had a bug-out like I'm having now and that led you to value investing? Do you still believe in index funds in this current market? The knowledge requirements to be a value investor seem much higher than for an index-fund investor. It's crazy intimidating. Do I just start reading your investment bibles and leave my money on the sidelines until I understand how make investment decisions in individual companies?

tldr2; I am questioning the fundamentals of my buy-and-hold index fund approach to investing. What the hell do I do?

288,2021-05-14 19:11:10,t3_ncgfqa,ncgfqa,investing,"Fears of the U.S. economy running hot receded on Friday after new data showed a slowdown in consumer spending in April.

Retail sales were flat on the month, falling short of expectations of a 1% gain. However, the monthly gain for March was revised up by a full percentage point to 10.7%., leaving aggregate spending roughly where economists expected it to be over the two months.

Core retail sales fell 0.8% on the month, rather than rising 0.7% as expected. Here too, the March figure was revised upward to a gain of 9.0% from an initial estimate of 8.4%.

James Knightley. chief international economist with ING, said via Twitter that the staged reopening of the economy also meant that spending was draining away from goods to services. 
""Re-opening means increased options for spending money, meaning a movement away from “things” to “experiences” that aren’t measured within retail sales,"" Knightley said.

The figures once again testified to idiosyncracies in consumer spending patterns as the economy emerges slowly and unevenly from the Covid-19 pandemic: sales at auto dealerships rose 3.1% on the month, corroborating the robust demand for cars that had also been evident in the sharp rise in prices for vehicles in April's inflation report earlier in the week.

By contrast, sales of apparel fell 5.1% and sales at hobby and sporting stores fell 3.6% on the month, having surged in March. 

March's data had been skewed by the effect of stimulus checks arriving at households across the country which, coupled with the start of economic reopening, had resulted in an explosion in overall spending.
""It was inevitable that there would be some declines in spending in April given that the vast majority of the $1,400 checks had already been paid out the previous month, but the details show sales in most categories reversing only part of their earlier surge,"" said Andrew Hunter, senior U.S. economist with Capital Economics in a note to clients.""

Hunter noted that spending on food and drink services rose 3% on the month, after surging 13.5% in March as bars and restaurants across the country reopened in growing numbers. It's now only 2% below its pre-pandemic peak, he argued.","Retail Sales Stagnate in April, But Offset by Upward Revision to March Data",,
289,2021-05-15 02:51:02,t3_ncp9na,ncp9na,investing,"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4426754-investing-with-inflation-150-years-data

Say what you want about Seeking Alpha, but this writer is generally considered the most analytical author there and in no way limits her team's work to Seeking Alpha. I notice some people don't like the website, which is fine, but this woman could write for Forbes or academic journals etc. if she wanted to do so, in my opinion.

The article looks at inflation, money supply, international responses to inflation, and its effects on different classes of people. It also touches on how different asset classes may play out under different conditions.

Of note is her conclusion that people who scream hyperinflation are farcically wrong, but she also notes when short term heavy inflation rears its head it stays on and doesn't dissipate. Say, if 5% inflation happens one year, it remains, even if it doesn't feature heavier inflation going further. Like many things in investing, the likely outcome is the middle road.

She also points out how the macro economy may be trending more towards labor over capital. Overall I think such effects would balance out, as better wages and cheaper equities seem great to me personally, although she doesn't delve very far into the thought.

My portfolio is equity REIT heavy so I especially liked her explanation of how real estate does okay with both higher inflation and higher interest rates, contrary to popular belief. Entry point is key--fixed rate debt is of course the best to have in an inflationary environment. 

""Interest rates: When interest rates rise, it puts downward pressure on most asset prices, as we saw in the inflationary decade of the 1970s. When interest rates remain low, then monetary inflation remains a decent environment for asset prices, as we saw in the inflationary decade of the 1940s from the market bottom in 1942.""

""Pendulum swings: Whenever the balance of power favors the wealthy, due to some combination of offshoring, automation, and the political environment, then monetary inflation is more likely to translate into asset price inflation. Whenever the balance of power shifts towards labor, due to labor onshoring, labor organization, and/or populist politics gaining a foothold, then monetary inflation is more likely to translate into consumer price inflation. This is largely correlated to wage increases or lack thereof, as well as being correlated to the size and scope of government transfer payments and tax policy.""

""Inflation: During periods of moderate to high inflation, gold and commodities tend to do extremely well. Equities outperform bonds more often than not, but it depends on the type of equities and their starting valuations, and therefore have a huge variance. Real estate does well, mainly because leverage attached to it gets melted away from inflation. Bonds do poorly in inflationary environments.""

""Deflationary shock: If temporary deflation is caused by a deflationary shock, such as a recession or depression, bonds are the place to be, and outperform everything else. Gold also generally does fine compared to other assets. Stocks and commodities usually perform very poorly.""

""Productive deflation or disinflation: Bonds and stocks do well in goldilocks periods of strong real growth, with low inflation and high productivity gains. Between the two, stocks can do better. Commodities and gold are prone to poor performance in this type of environment.
My base case going forward continues to be that with the combination of sizable broad money supply growth, along with public opinion pushing the pendulum back away from globalization, consumer price inflation is likely to be higher in the 2020s decade than in the 2010s decade.""

These points may be common knowledge to some, but I found it informative. Consumer price inflation is pretty identical to what we think of as ""inflation,"" so it seems fair to submit inflation will be higher than we are used to but not catastrophic or anything. So, for me, I like to think my REITs, most of which have pretty strong rent escalators linked to CPI (up to 3% annually with base increase no matter what), will do fine over a multi-year period. 

I hate precious metals since I don't really think of them as hard assets--it's just a series of price quotes to most people who hold it--there is some correlation to real estate. Consider how the ticker LAND had pretty extreme outperformance compared to its own asset class during 2020 which is still ongoing since that REIT focuses on owning specialty crop farmland with water rights. It outperformed gold swiftly, yet probably appeals to the same kind of buyer and pays cash dividends. 

I'd also like to remind people many REITs invest in free-standing properties on a triple net basis and that retail stores are still opening up en masse, largely among discount retailers which easily co-exist with internet commerce in poorer areas (think Dollar General, which works with companies like Instacart). Even with covid there was no retail apocalypse among corporate discount retailers. Most of these lease to REITs and pay a good deal of rent.

It may also be worthwhile to consider that with higher than usual inflation comes a risk of higher than usual interest rates being implemented, again, not to a catastrophic scare mongering level. Financials that focus on offering floating rate loans may do well over the coming years. Burry recently invested a good deal of money in a multi-cycle weathered business development company, Ares Capital, which would organically benefit from even minor rate hikes.

I think the best thing I pulled from the article is: don't worry so much. Inflation will happen, but it won't be insane. Perhaps focus less on long duration equities, ie. very high multiple tech corporations, and at least consider adding assets that are more down to Earth.",Lyn Schwartzer on Inflation Trends,,

Fundamentals on Google are sound: strong recurring revenue base, monopolistic tendencies, value add to customer, network effects, cross selling across revenue streams etc.  I find it hard to argue that Google is going anywhere anytime soon.

Valuation wise, many think that FAANG is overpriced.  Some of it is.  Google trades at a whopping 37x earnings! But only 24x forward.  And only 15x fwd EV/EBITDA.  That is the metric I will focus on for now as I tend to use DCF models with EV/EBITDA terminal values.  The average EV/EBITDA multiple over the last 10 years is about 16x.  The lowest was 10x and 10x is the lowest it ever traded since IPO.  Using a DCF model and using ultra bear scenario of the following assumptions: 2022-2025 revenue growth of 0% annually (yes, correct),  gross margins of 55% (below the 10 year average of 60%), operating margin of about 23% (10 year average 25%), D&A constant at 8% of revenue, Capex in line with Bloomberg estimates approx 16-17% of revenue, and change in NWC of about -3% (consistent with last 4 years).  WACC is 9.5% and used a 10x exit multiple.  This estimates an intrinsic value of $2068, about -9% from current values.  And that is the bear case with ultra bearish assumptions.

The base case then with revenue growth of 10%, same margins, higher depreciation based on consensus estimates, and an exit multiple of the 10 year average of 16x yields a price of $4831, upside of 112%.

Of course, I never truly depend on a DCF model to provide an exact price because there are so many assumptions that will never play out as expected, but it is a great tool to identify what factors impact price and some worst case scenarios.  It is further evidence to me that Google is one of the most undervalued large caps with a wide moat around its largest product, expanding its range and interconnectivity of its products constantly, and generating a significant amount of cash in the meantime.

Let me know your thoughts.

Edit: Cant disagree more with the Mod post below.  EV/EBITDA is a widely accepted method of DCF analysis especially when comparing firms with varying amounts of leverage.  EV/EBITDA is a terminal multiple used to estimate a value for the company at the end of the forecasting period.  The forecasting period still uses FCFF.  I find it weird that these mods can just post their OPINION on these threads and state it as if it is a FACT.  All of my thesis and modeling is clearly opinion and open to discussion, where the Mod is not for whatever reason.",GOOGL - What am I missing?,,

The outperformance of PSLDX is pretty clear. I am not very familiar with its methodology, but I did some reading and encountered the opinion its outperformance may not last due to a potential rise of interest rates. So I looked at a couple of other metrics--please keep in mind I don't know much about the bond market overall and would be happy to learn I have examined things incorrectly. 

I chose 2016 because it captured when the Federal Fund Rate started to meaningfully rise (they also started to rise in 2015, but I chose a nice 5 year slice). They increased steadily into 2019, then plateaued a bit, then of course were struck down by covid.

[https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart](https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart)

Next I looked into the daily treasury yield curve rates from this period. The 10 Year rate fluctuated steadily all throughout 2016 but ultimately ended the year higher. It fluctuated similarly through 2017, ending very slightly lower. It increased during most of 2018, then only ended slightly higher by the end of the year. It lowered through the end of 2019.  It ended much lower by 2020. And through today it is higher than in 2020, but still much lower than it has been in years. 

[https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/TextView.aspx?data=yieldYear&year=2016](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/TextView.aspx?data=yieldYear&year=2016)

Below is a plot of the dividends paid from PSLDX, where all the gains are to be had.

[https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSLDX/dividends/history](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSLDX/dividends/history)

You'll notice the higher dividend payouts tend to correspond to where the higher interest rates are plotted. Granted, the fund holds the S&P, so its outperformance can in part be explained by the general rise of the S&P 500 equities since 2016. But, I did not find where higher interest rates pose a risk to its performance. I also noticed its highest-ever dividend payout was in 2013, where the federal funds rate was miniscule and the 10 Year increased from 1.86 to 3.04 by the end of the year. And even when interest rates are very low, say from 2020-2021, the fund still outperforms the S&P ETF listed, much less our favorite REIT. O, I can forgive, since I believe in its long term success. 

[https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio#analysisResults](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio#analysisResults)

It appears the fund generates a great deal of alpha the higher interest rates become. It also generates alpha when interest rates are low. Drawdowns can indeed be high, so if one were to invest in the fund, it is likely best to put money into it after it has experienced a drawdown, or simply do what investors should do and put money into it that you don't plan on using for many years. 

The share price is low--this is common with many mutual funds. Someone recently mentioned that as a drawback to it... yes, it is lower than the 10 dollar price in 2007... but I think if you understand this is a particular sort of fund and not some silly low budget penny stock, the difference is clear. It is a volatile fund, yet appears to have an overall stability over time, with extreme dividend payouts. While I think broad market ETFs are great for capturing the mood of the overall corporate economy, the more I read about this particular fund, the more I find it to be a good choice for outperformance over a multi-year period. People worry about so many things: expense ratios, volatility, weird methodology. Yet, total returns tend to present their own strong argument for an investment. 

It appears to benefit from higher interest rates, and also does fine with lower interest rates. That is what I find to be especially interesting (ha). It's not a 3x leveraged daily fund subject to decay or anything like that, to my knowledge. It may even be simpler than your average PIMCO CEF.  

I plan on trying to learn more about the fund before I actually put money into it, since I want a firmer grasp of its mechanics and especially want to determine if it can maintain its performance over more time. In the meantime, I think it's overlooked by everyone but niche investors. Plenty of garbage tickers are passed around on Reddit (hello bizarre mortgage REITs that obviously destroy value over time and fraudulent SPACs) but there is little popular information on this fund which is still kicking out solid performance since the Great Recession when derivatives really were the devil. 

Anyway when I post on Reddit, I do so to learn. I very recently posted about the fund here--this was before I looked at interest rates and how they may correlate with it. I am becoming more convinced it is a good investment and would like to know arguments against it beyond the fact it's more complex than a simple passive ETF.","S&P 500, Realty Income, and S&P 500 Long Duration",,

That company is AT&T (T) and we’ll break-down some opportunities & challenges this cash-generating machine faces in the mid-to-long term.

**The Overview**

AT&T has three business segments: Communications, Warner Media, and Latin America. AT&T’s communications segment contributes \~79% of operating revenues and \~80% of profits. AT&T’s recent acquisition of Warner Media adds to AT&T’s development, production, and distribution capabilities. The Warner Media acquisition has been broadly successful, comprising 17% of AT&T’s revenues and 22% of profits. Warner Bros. is one of the largest TV and film studios globally, remains a media powerhouse with a profound content library that reaches audiences across many platforms.

In this day and age huge “value” is seen in the amount of users or customers a company has reached. A quick glance at Zoom and we can see that a large portion of their value comes from the 300 million users they leverage. Coming back to AT&T they have over 170 million customers across numerous products to go along with a broad array of content rights.

**HBO Max**

One of AT&T’s biggest risks over the next 5 years comes from their acquisition of HBO Max. Main concerns are over whether or not they can retain or grow the service’s subscriber base and ultimately increase earnings. Management has recently **increased expectations** of the HBO Max subscription base to reach between 120 to 150 million subscribers by 2025, which is up from their relatively conservative estimate of 75-90 million in 2019. Here’s a look from their recent earnings presentation  

AT&T is progressing in its postpaid wireless, and HBO Max segments, which saw \~800k lines and an additional **\~3.5M subscribers added in their previous two quarters**. Consumers are willing to spend more on high-quality internet service as work from home continues.

**Final Thoughts**

When we look at AT&T’s share price over the last 10 years and we see the stock is up roughly 10% during that time-period it doesn’t necessarily instill confidence as a profitable investment. Some might argue why purchasing shares of AT&T would be a better investment than a “more secure” bond play. However, it is our opinion that AT&T is at a turning point and we may now be able to see the best of both worlds, a high yield dividend return, as well as steady growth in revenues.

A 5% return per annum, paired with its high dividend yield of \~6-7%, allows AT&T to remain more attractive than treasury bonds even with the associated risk of holding shares. Despite increased debt levels and decreased credit ratings, AT&T has a strong strategy to reduce its debt burden. AT&T should continue to have a dividend payout ratio at roughly 50% of FCF, acting as a bond proxy in an investor’s portfolio.

**What I learned from Q1 call** 

**Three Big Drivers for the future** 

* CTV 
* UID 2.0 
* Solimar Platform 

**So why do they matter?** 

**CTV** 
- CTV is an umbrella term, compromises of both Internet T.V and smart T.Vs.
- More consumers switching from Cable to CTV 
- Major content owners moving more premium content online 
- T.V providers continue to fight for consumer attention 

**Current Problem**
- Advertisers currently are paying premium prices to publishers (Websites like ESPN) without getting the value of said premium price. 
- The Trade Desk would allow them to not only receive that value but advertisers would now have the ability to be more deliberate about what CTV ads they buy and how to apply data driven decisioning in T.V at an increased scale.


**UID 2.0** 
- This in TTD's eyes is the future of the internet in a world without cookies. This would essentially replace them. 
- I will do my best to explain said function, but to understand why does this need to be a thing and what is it solving? 

**Current Problem** 
- What the TTD is trying to accomplish is to create a free and open internet, an internet that can move past the walled gardens of Google, Facebook, Apple Ect. In fact the CEO Jeff Green uses the following sentence. ""Is the internet going to be controlled by large tech companies or will power be distributed. Will choice sit with consumers and each content owner?""

- We've heard of google and apple ending third party cookies in an attempt to ""protect"" their customers, which is true to an extent. 

**What UID 2.0 going to do to change the internet** 
- UID 2.0 is Open Source meanings you are able to build on it, and it is about a better internet allowing consumers to have control.
 
**How it Works** 

**1)** Consumers sign in once with an email (this email is your *common ID*)
**2)**  You will opt in site by site, app channel only once
**3)** When you log in once, you will receive an email authentication providing consumers with the explanation of the value exchange of the internet. The idea is to make it clear and consistent. 
**4)** This common ID will be used by advertisers and publishers 
**5)** Consumers are then able to use privacy settings to change or opt out directly from the services they know. 
**6)** The consumer controls their data, it's not controlled by Big Tech. 

**But its Big Tech, how can they penetrate those ""Walled Gardens""?** 

- *Double Encryption Publishers (DEP)*
- This allows publishers to encrypt UID 2 and allows them to unencrypt it for certain advertisers or publishers. DEP prevents others from taking data and insight from publishers. (Yes even Big Tech) 

**Solimar** 

- Solimar is the TTD's biggest platform upgrade in their history (Well that's what Jeff said)
- It is bringing together current existing features TTD offers and is making it easy to use for marketers 
- **Koa AI** for example is a current feature the is being upgraded and integrated into Solimar 

**Koa AI** 
- Koa AI is well... AI. It analyzes data from across the internet to help make sure you’re reaching the right audience at the right price. As Koa learns, it optimizes your campaigns automatically.

- ""Solimar helps advertisers want to understand how their campaigns are driving in-store sales.

Would love to hear opinions about TTD, discussing what the future looks like right now.

310,2021-05-16 18:36:30,t3_ndupku,ndupku,investing,"Hi everyone! This is gonna be a long wall of text, I will write a tl;dr as well so please check the bottom if it scares you.

**Why TKC?**

So I have been researching about Turkcell, a Turkish company that is traded in BIST (Istanbul stock exchange) and NYSE. It had my attention because its been under performing compared to both global stocks and Turkish stocks (even though it's been performing really well financially compared to other companies traded in BIST). Before dipping to $4.67 USD due to pandemic in late march - early april, it was traded for $5.77 USD (early march 2020) and it was around 10-11 USD during 2018. As of today, it's traded for only $4.56 USD. Biggest reason for that freefall of the stock price is downfall of the Turkish economy and the devaluation of the Turkish lira but other Turkish stocks doesn't seem to care as much as TKC does. For comparison, march 2020 dip of XU100 (adjusted by the USD exchange rate of that time) index was 114 (857/7,5), now it is 171 (1441/8.4). There has been a Turkish stock exchange rally even in USD terms as well, which TKC missed. Not to mention that Turkish banks performed terribly and they have around 17% [weight in the XU100.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EqbtfSZXUAEnwu0?format=png&name=small)

**About the company**

So the company is primarily a telecommunication company (like Vodafone). Even though it offers value added services like BiP (mainly whatsapp alternative), Fizy (spotify alternative, TV+, Paycell (fintech), Pasaj (e-commerce mostly selling tech products), Lifebox (cloud service), Yaani (search engine), Dergilik (digital publishing platform) it's primary source of income is telecommunication and internet for home via Superonline (Turkcell company). The company operates in Turkey, Ukraine (lifecell), Belarus, Azerbaijan, Cyprus, Netherlands and Germany (though their operations in the last 2 are not directly profit seeking afaik). Main competitors in Turkey (main market) are Vodafone and Turk Telekom. Vodafone and Turk Telekom offers cheaper prices but Turkcell offers better service and as of today it has the highest share of the market with 42%. Turkcell also invests more than the combination of the competition, [you can check their mobile data segment investments here](https://hwp.com.tr/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Mobile-yatirim.jpg). One last fundamental thing about company's operations is that it is part of the [TOGG project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOGG) (electric car company founded recently and according to their CEO, they will start the mass production is 2022) and owns 19% of the TOGG as well. The taxes for foreign made cars in Turkey are extremely high and the rumor is that the government is thinking about subsidizing this project to decrease country's account deficit by both not depending on foreign made cars and oil (which Turkey doesn't have).

**Financials**

I don't want to rewrite what is already written in detail so I will provide some sources instead.

[1st Q 2021 presentation (1.1B TL net income)](https://s.turkcell.com.tr/hakkimizda/en/yatirimciiliskileri/InvestorReportLibrary/Presentation-Q121-ENG.pdf)

[Annual report of 2020 (4.24B TL net income)](https://s.turkcell.com.tr/hakkimizda/en/yatirimciiliskileri/InvestorReportLibrary/Turkell-IAR-2020-ENG.pdf)

Their net income kept growing for a while, you can check more about their financials [in their website here.](https://www.turkcell.com.tr/en/aboutus/investor-relations) Check [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yIDdTqig4k) as well.

**Possible things that may drive the value up.**

I already talked about the TOGG project above, but the investors seem to didn't care about it. I think they have their doubts about the project (which is understandable due to fragile Turkish economy). But I believe if the mass production starts in 2022 it will have a really good impact on the stock.

Another thing is possible IPOs. In february this year, CEO stated that they are considering the IPO of their home internet company, Superonline. According to bloomberg, they started talking with the investment banks about it in April. You can read more about it [here.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-06/turkcell-is-said-to-approach-banks-on-ipo-plan-for-internet-unit) Also, they were considering the [IPO of Global Tower in 2016](https://www.reuters.com/article/turkcell-globaltower-idUSL8N1CU4JX) but they didn't do it calling the market unsuitable for a new IPO. Considering the IPO madness happening in Turkish market, they may also consider it. I also want to remind you that vodafone did a similar IPO last year and they had a pretty good valuation.

Lastly, the stock had management issues before. The company couldn't share dividends and it had decision making issues as well. But as of June 2020, this problem is solved because Turkish Wealth Fund bought the stocks from Telia and Karamehmets. Now the company gives dividends quarterly (0.39 TRY per quarter and the stock is valued 15.20 TRY atm in Turkey, not sure about it in NYSE). I believe investing in TKC just because of the dividend is an enough reason.

**One important thing that caught my eye**

Last month one of the foreign institutions sent the [mandatory notification](https://www.kap.org.tr/en/Bildirim/932236) that their shares passed the 5% barrier. I was watching their aggressive purchases and they keep buying. [This is the buyers-sellers chart for the last one and a half month](https://imgur.com/a/juARwKD). Gedik investment made the 77% of the purchases. Gedik then transferred it to Deutsche bank. During that period amount of shares which are **held by the foreigners increased by 30 million stocks.**

**Why you should NOT buy/why is it undervalued?**

As I mentioned above, TRY is not performing well. Lately, Turkish Lira lost good portion of it's value. This is the main risk for this stock in my opinion. But the thing is, **82% percent of the float is held by the foreigners**, and even though the foreigner's interest in Turkish stock exchange kept decreasing, their shares in Turkcell kept increasing. It seems they think that it is a good buy despite the risk of Turkish Lira. I also believe that it is a buy for sure long term, but it is risky for the short term. Also, even if the TRY performs well, there is a possibility that with the possible interest rates increase, **DXY may start it's bull run which will negatively affect the stock.**

Another thing is, in October, Letterone will have the ability to sell some of their shares in the stock exchange. It is not clear whether they will or not, but it is risky since it will increase the shares traded. Last year, they sold some of it on the market for 15.5 liras per share (15.20 is the current price of the stock).

&#x200B;

**Summary**

I believe that this stock is a good buy because of their financials, dividend, investments (mainly the electric car project TOGG), incoming IPO and accumulation of the stocks by certain investment group. But there are 2 main risks as well, fragile Turkish economy and the stocks held by Letterone. But even with those risks, I dont think it will devaluate more at this point.","Turkcell Communication Services ($TKC), why you should/shouldn't invest in it. Fundamentals of an undervalued stock.",,

BASIC COMPANY INFORMATION

Lockheed Martin is aerospace and defence company which provides very high-end military equipment. Aircraft is where they particularly shine with the F-35 accounting for about 30% of the company's revenue.

The lion's share of the company's revenue comes the united states government. Most of all aircraft used by the air force comes from this one company.

CEO INFORMATION

Lockheed recently announced in 2020 a new CEO to run the company. His name is Jim Taiclet .While having several years of experience with Lockheed, his previous experience as CEO was not with another defense company.

Most of his career was spent running the successful REIT known as American Tower (AMT). The company has been very successful both during and after his tenure. (Which is another great dividend growth company I might add).

DIVIDEND HISTORY/SAHRE BUYBACKS

Quarterly Payout (At A Glance)
2020 - $2.60
2019 - $2.40
2018 - $2.20
2017 - $2.00
2016 - $1.82
2015 - $1.65

Dividend Yield = 2.68%

Payout Ratio = ~40% (Very Safe)

Let me start be saying that this company is EXTREMELY  profitable. The company is currently on an 18 year consecutive dividend streak. Not to mention the company buys back BILLIONS of its own stock year in and year out. I fully expect this company to be a dividend aristocrat in a few years.

The dividend yield is about double that of the S&P as of today and only has a Payout Ratio of about 40%. This means that not only does this company has a good yield while buying back stock, but this company can EASILY afford to maintain and RAISE the dividend over time dramatically.

MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS

The company has a long history of M&A activity and the most recent example of this Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD). This is yet another example of the company using its financial fortress of a balance sheet and exemplary cash flows to acquire other businesses.

AJRD is a space and aeronautics company which could potentially extend more deals with NASA and the U.S. government. This was recently announced about six months ago in December 2020 and is likely to finalize in 2021.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION

The company has incredible financials. The balance sheet is a financial fortress. The debt load is very controllable. Cash flows continue to pour in record numbers year after year and 2021 guidance issued by the company expects record revenue and record EPS for the year. 

The Biden administration just issued an increase in defense spending of about ~1% earlier this year. All the more reason for this company's financials to continue to stay healthy. Financials linked below....

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LMT/balance-sheet/

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LMT/cash-flow?p=LMT

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LMT/financials?p=LMT

GROWTH STORY MOVING FORWARD

LMT is expected to grow top-line revenue numbers 4.50% in 2021 and 3.70% in 2022. Earnings per share for  the company in 2020 finished at $24.58. This is expected to grow to $26.68 in 2021 and $27.90 in 2022.

Contracts are usually signed many years in advance. Revenues can be easily forcasted for the next several years due to the timelines of the contracts. Furthermore, innovation is not only encouraged, but expected by shareholders AND the united states military is order for our nation to maintain relevant in terms of weaponry.

New age military equipment is usually pretty ""hush-hush"" on what is in the works but Lockheed Martin does disclose some of these new products including technologies such as new highly intelligent drones, missile systems, and even targeted lasers.

One thing is for sure, the military will continue come out with bigger and badder weapons. Who will likely be selling it to them? Probably good ole LMT.

Newer acquisitions such as the recent AJRD deal allows Lockheed to also focus on other products in the space category and is another wildcard with some potential.

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LMT/analysis?p=LMT

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE/ BARRIER TO ENTRY

If you were given 10 million dollars, and your goal was to create a globally recognized soda brand, could you get it done? Maybe. What about 10 million to create a social media platform? Also a maybe. But could you start a aeronautics and/or defence company with 10 million budget? Absolutely not.

The regulations are incredibly strict. The demand for capital is VERY HIGH with projects frequently running into the billions of dollars. Switching from one business to another poses risks for the government and our military and are usually avoided.

This makes the U.S. government very loyal and sticky to LMT business and this is very likely to continue. While there are competitors in the space....Lockheed continues to dominate this market.

VALUATION (WHY IT'S A GREAT BUY IMO)

As mentioned earlier, the company is expected to produce $27.90 in EPS in 2022. Based of of today's price of $390, this gives this company a forward PE ratio of ~13.9. This is an EXTREMELY low forward PE ratio for a company putting up record numbers and dominating the market that it operates in. 

This is even more impressive considering it's still off a fair amount from it's previous all time highs. I am very bullish and this is one of my largest positions. I am not remotely interested in selling. I am buying at these prices or really anything even close to these levels. I wouldn't sell a share if this company were to go to $800 a share tomorrow morning.

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LMT/analysis?p=LMT

RISK FACTORS TO CONSIDER

Almost all revenue comes from one customer (the government). It is steady and consistent but if the government were to fall out of love with Lockheed then this company would be negatively impacted.

There aren't many who could take down LMTs throne but their main competitor is Boeing. Boeing has the capital and leverage to compete with Lockheed Martin long term.

This company is susceptible to a number of different geopolitical risks. Conflicts with other countries could be both a Negative AND a positive for Lockheed.

The current political climate is leaning harder and harder towards a more relaxed defence budget.

I've read that equities usually take a hit because it becomes more expensive for companies to borrow (so they borrow and invest less and are therefore estimated to have earnings decrease relative to some previous amount/projection, or they borrow the same but have to earn more of it to pay it back, which is harder for them to do or siphons profits from dividends/re-investment et cetera).

I've also read bond values in general take a hit because people don't want to hold a 10 year bond at 1.5% when they can hold a 10 year bond at 2% so they sell the lower-yield bond and there are fewer buyers so the price goes down and all that. Different bond durations react differently, but they all decline, at least temporarily.

If these two understandings are generally true, which usually gets hit worse from an interest rate increase, stocks or bonds? Or do they both get hit the same? Is there a duration element to the decline in value that each experiences, or is that the same as well?

I know that not everyone has a precise method to do DDs and research about a company or a stock, but maybe someone does.I'm  from Europe, i'm pretty new in this world and i'm trying to be as more informed and smart as i can.

So, there are some things you have to do if you want to become a successful investor / trader, one of the most important is certainly to research and understand the company you're investing in and the financial instrument you're about to use.

When it comes to do some DD about a stock, i understand there are multiple things to look at.What are the most important in your opinion ? What instruments do you use and why ?

Heres what i'm doing for now:

I usually start reading about the company, its core business and the news about it, then i try to understand what is the financial / economic condition of the company and then i do some technical analysis on the chart, focusing on the price and the value i think the stock could have, and also using MA, EMA, MACd, RSI indicators.

I use mostly Yahoo Finance and [Investing.com](https://Investing.com) for the economical and financial part, and mostly WeBull for the charts.

Finally i try to find some smart opinions on Reddit and maybe discuss the stock with someone else.

Any suggestion ?

Thanks",What is your process when you do your DD about a company/stock ? What are the sites / instruments that you find more useful ?,,

> Coinbase Global, Inc. (“Coinbase”) (Nasdaq: COIN) today announced its intention to offer, subject to market conditions and other factors, $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the “notes”) in a private offering (the “offering”) to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Coinbase also expects to grant the initial purchasers of the notes a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $187.5 million principal amount of notes solely to cover over-allotments. The notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of Coinbase, will accrue interest payable semi-annually in arrears and will mature on June 1, 2026, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. The notes will be convertible into cash, shares of Coinbase’s Class A common stock, or a combination thereof, at Coinbase’s election.

A little surprising to me given the recent IPO and the fact that they trade below ipo reference price ($250, current close is 248.24, ~3% additional drop after market on these news). I still feel investment in $COIN presents an interesting way to expose oneself to crypto without actually holding crypto (and the whole “sell the pickaxes in the gold rush”). At the same time I’m guessing pressure is mounting and their fat margins might not be staying there for long so they will need to try to scale as much as possible.",Coinbase announced a $1.25B private offering,,

October 1990: 6.4%, drop to 2.8% one year later

January 2001: 3.7%, drop to to 1.2% one year later

September 2005: 4.7%, drop to 2.0% one year later

September 2011: 3.8%, drop to 1.9% one year later

CPI spike in 2021 is likely “transitory” as suggested by the Fed, due to economic reopening and supply chain constraints caused by last year. We are also still far from full employment and the tech driven deflationary forces are not going away.

Also keep in mind that the current ongoing inflation is procyclical: prices in the US have risen rapidly because the economy reopened rapidly. This is not the same as the countercyclical inflation of 1970s. Over the past 30 years, the SP500 has performed most strongly during periods of rising growth and rising procyclical inflation.

The live TV streaming provider posted blowout financial results after Tuesday's market close. The stock had hit a six-month low earlier in the trading day. 

Coming through with its third consecutive quarter of accelerating year-over-year top-line growth since going public late last year, fuboTV was full of positive surprises. A historic sequential increase in subscribers during a seasonally sleepy quarter. A big boost to its full-year guidance. FuboTV had [a lot to prove](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/05/11/fubotv-stock-has-a-lot-to-prove-this-week/) heading into this critical financial update, and it delivered. 

Playing to win 

There's a lot of skeptic silencing in fuboTV's first-quarter performance. Revenue soared 135% to $119.7 million, well ahead of the 98% to 102% that it was [forecasting in early March](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/03/good-luck-betting-against-fubotv-stock/). This is the second time in a row that fuboTV has put up lowball guidance that it beat with ease. It's a trend that bears noting -- and respecting. 

There's still plenty of red ink here, but with operating expenses only up 80% relative to the 135% top-line burst we're seeing net loss and adjusted EBITDA margins improving. FuboTV's average revenue per user is rising, and against that welcome trend the live TV platform is clocking in with a sequential improvement in subscriber acquisition costs. 

We're seeing tailwinds riding tailwinds here. FuboTV now has 590,430 subs on its books, 105% more than it had a year earlier. Revenue is growing even faster on the heels of a 131% surge in subscription revenue and ad revenue more than tripling. Another neat tidbit on its subscriber count is that it's also 43,000 higher than it was in December. This is the first time that it actually posted a sequential increase in accounts during the first three months of the calendar year. 

FuboTV now sees 830,000 to 850,000 subscribers by year-end, up from the 760,000 to 770,000 it was targeting just two months ago. This is old hat for investors as fuboTV jacked up its 2020 subscriber goal in October, November, and January last time out. This should also be a reminder that any likely revision in a couple of months will probably be higher yet again.

With average revenue per user approaching $70 a month between subscriptions and ads, can things get even better? Well, fuboTV is still on track to roll out a free-to-play interactive gaming app that will enhance the live sports it streams through more than three dozen channels. The stakes will be raised in the fourth quarter when Fubo Sportsbook launches in markets where it can clear legal hurdles. Fantasy sports and then actual wagering will make fuboTV even more money than they are right now, but more importantly, they're going to improve engagement. 

FuboTV has been one of the wildest stocks since its [IPO](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/ipo-stocks/) seven months ago. It was a six-bagger at one point, only to shed more than three-quarters of its value by Tuesday's market open. A blowout quarter is the perfect cure to market indifference. Now it's up to fuboTV to make the most of its new momentum to start winning again.",$$FUBO Has Finally Bottomed Out... Charts Looking Amazing,,

Have a house where I am currently refinancing to a 2.75 30y fixed rate (including 4500 in lender credits)

Appraisal just came in and it is, somewhat predictably, a high value. 

I was thinking to do a cash-out refi instead of a rate-and-term, take out ~100k in cash to bring up the mortgage to 80 percent of the new value.  I could afford this with my monthly budget but it would be tighter, around half my net pay after taking out all taxes/401k/hsa/roth contributions.  Would still be <30 percent of my gross pay (including PITI). The rate would stay the same but I'd have to pay 1k in points instead of receiving a 4500 lender credit.  (or I could get a 2.875 rate with a 2k lender credit).

My thinking was that, because the loan interest rate is so low, it makes more sense to grab the cash and then invest it (index fund, rental property, etc) rather than keep it in the house piggy bank.  Inflation is high these days, so I wasn't looking to keep much in cash - but I did want to increase my emergency fund slightly before investing the rest.

Do people think this is a good idea or is it better to keep the LTV lower and stick to a rate and term refinance?

In my view, any transaction explicitly undertaken with manipulative intent is a bright line violation of the law. If your primary or sole intent in a transaction is to manipulate the market price, that is illegal market manipulation. It doesn't matter if everyone knows you are doing it; the intent is the issue.

Of course, whether a transaction is or is not manipulative is very different than whether or not manipulation is easy or worth it to prove in an enforcement action. Given that every transaction affects market price to some degree, there is a huge gray area.

Everyday new information becomes available, and every participant will adjust their pricing models and probabilities accordingly.

I’d agree also that functioning social democracies are capitalistic and have property rights, but they have also nationalized industries and put controls on the market in certain areas, so are these socialistic policies? I don’t agree with the blanket assessment that putting power in the hands of the government is necessarily a bad thing, provided that the government is genuinely representative of the people.

Those social democracies are a good example of that because while the market does exist, it is considered a secondary priority to ensuring that people have basic standards of living.

[https://www.investopedia.com/investing/how-interest-rates-affect-stock-market/](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/how-interest-rates-affect-stock-market/)

However, I still don't understand why it will lead to such a big fall. 

I am just thinking aloud here...

I mean, I understand that the increase in rates by the Fed will lead to increase in the interest rates that banks offer to companies, and thus if a company has a lot of debt, it will suffer. But how about companies that are sitting on billions of cash like Apple and google? How will it affect them? If the interest rate hikes, then won't they be able to use that cash to eat away a good portion of their debt and compensate for the increase in rates?

Even for the companies that have a big debt, it is not like they run everything on debt. Also, if inflation catches up everywhere, the price of products will also increase, so somehow compensating for the increases interest that these companies are paying.. but maybe there will be quite some considerable time lag between the increase in bank interest rates and the increase of product prices? And maybe the increase in product prices will lead to less sales?   But if it is essential product, then people have no option, right? I mean, if the price of cooking oil increases, even doubles, we will complain but will still buy it.  But for the non essential items (e.g. clothing accessories, dinning out, ...), maybe there will be a big hit?

Where did they go? Well some of them went to the next best choice on the aristocrat list, XOM, up 2.3% on the day.  
It is my good fortune to be holding XOM as well, indeed 4 times as much as I hold T.

* there's a difference between notional value and the actual price he paid for these put options. the 530 million is very likely the notional value of these puts, not the price he paid. unless Burry has some secret undisclosed positions, look at his 13F, his whole portfolio is worth less than 200 million. 
* when buying puts, the puts with a lower strike price will be less expensive than the higher ones. for example, stock price is 100$, puts with a strike price of 105$ will be priced higher than those with a strike price of 95$.
* Burry most likely made a bet here, so the chances he bought puts at a strike price higher than the then actual price of Tesla is very unlikely. He probably bought OTM puts options which are less expensive, thus the price paid for this position is somewhere between 1 million and 25 million (it's a long range bcuz we can't be sure about the exact price he paid), depending on the puts maturity and other factors, but it's definitely not 530 million. 
* if you do 530000000/(8000\*100)=662.50, chances are that these puts have a strike price of 662.50$. This is more or less an average, since if you look at TSLA options chain, there's no strike price of 662.50, thus Burry might have bought puts with several different strike prices. the 530 million notional value is probably also an average of the notional values of the puts.
* these puts were bought when the actual price of Tesla was way above the average strike price of 662.50$, i.e. in the 700-800$ range, and given today's price, Burry already ""most likely"" made money on these puts.

Like web development, the entry bar is set very low because most apps are (or start out as) really simple. In this segment, you get low prices and you compete with tons of students, freelancers and local small businesses, all of which are perfectly capable of getting the job done. Being at a social occasion and hearing ""I have an idea for an app"" is a meme among programmers, and there are many who have built apps for local businesses. It does not scale up well.

With larger projects, most companies that have critical exposure to their customers via their apps either have de facto body leasing agreements with their preferred software consultancy or a standing in-house development team.

You may be able to find a software consultancy that does a lot of app development, but a pure play is unlikely. Often, mobile development is just a side show for them, and the real money is in ERP, CRM or custom enterprise development.",,gyi5ofe,t3_nesfc2

This is not the same as the countercyclical inflation of 1970s. Over the past 30 years, the SP500 has performed most strongly during periods of rising growth and rising procyclical inflation.

683,2021-05-17 23:46:48,t1_gyias9w,,investing,"# Naked puts - am I understanding correctly?

You sell for a given premium you collect at sale, and it is a contract to buy from someone else at the strike price.

Meaning if the price goes below the strike (-premium), you lose money, and everything above is a win.

\--------------

In my mind, this is a contract to *buy*. Select a price you'd be thrilled to buy at, select a number of contracts to represent the shares you'd love to buy at that price point, and fire it off. Either the price goes low and you basically 'limit buy' at contract close at that price, regardless of how low it went, or you at least keep the premium. Semi win-win.

So what's with the 'naked' part? Why won't TDA let me do this? Do I need actual money sitting around doing nothing to 'cover' this in the even I have to buy? Is the value of my other stocks (in excess) not sufficient to act as collateral for that possibility?

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedput.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedput.asp)

This suggests what makes it naked is failing to also hold a short position - as though if you were also short, it would be covered. But how do you go short to cover the put? *Buy a put?* But that seems to defeat the purpose if you goal is to *sell* a put.

I'm feeling dumb, can someone put me straight?",,gyias9w,t3_neb4xj

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_state?wprov=sfti1

Electing a socialist leader or socialist representatives does not immediately make a state socialist. There needs to be a clear intention and plan for the state to proceed toward a socialist system. In the absence of that you have a democratic republic with socialist representatives which, as long as the people’s voice is being represented in government, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that at all. 

My only point to start all this was that democratic rights are paramount, not property rights.

754,2021-05-18 00:17:32,t1_gyiei2y,,investing,"Options have variable called ""Greeks"" that determine the price of the option.

The main one I'm talking about is ""Delta"".

Delta is the $ value an option will increase/decrease by for every $1 change in the stock price that the option represents. An option with a delta of 0.5 means that if $SPY went down $1 your call option would go down by $0.50. In-the-money options have the highest delta among options. Really deep in-the-money options have delta values of 0.70 or higher.

Say a share of $SPY is worth $300 and an in-the-money call option is worth $30. If $SPY goes up $1 to $301 in a day that's a 0.33% return. Your in-the-money call option would go from $30 to $30.70, a 2.3% return.

It's a double edged sword though, because a high delta also magnifies the losses. 

LEAPS are used because they have the longest expiration date, giving more time for your option to come out on top in the green, as the average direction of the stock market is a positive slope.",,gyiei2y,t1_gyibvub

(After writing all this out, it turned into an essay. WTF am I doing. Also, this looks pretty boring. I swear its not actually!)

First of all, I feel nervous about valuations, so I am getting more serious about trying to buy great businesses at fair prices. Its not glamorous but I haven't lost all my money yet.... My approach is shifting more and more towards not-losing-money. (I'm not against growth, its just that 150 P/Es are a bit much for me right now.)

If I am curious about a business, the basic system for me is that I start with the general industry overview/trajectory etc. Then move to financials, then I check yahoo finance ratios, then read the 10k, and then I look at the stock price. Finally, I consider other peoples opinions/analysis from YouTube or reddit. Sometimes I consider what other high profile investors are doing too.

First I try to learn about the industry a business operates in. (A great way to think about industries, by the way, is Michael Porters ""5 Forces"") Basically I want to understand the barriers to entry, amount of competition, pricing power dynamics etc. Other factors like market size & growth are important too.

If I am still interested in a company, I start with the income statement and look for profitability. If its not profitable I need to find out why. Next I look for revenue growth. If revenue is growing but net losses are increasing, I am turned off (generally speaking)

Next I go to balance sheet check if they have the cash on hand to pay their current liabilities. I don't want a company that will have financing problems in the next 3 months. Next, I check the shares outstanding; is it growing or reducing? If share counts are growing, there better be a compelling reason. Then i look at debt levels; I want to understand how leveraged they are. If interest rates go up, I want to understand the effect it would have on profitability/cash burn.

Finally I try to consider the cash flow. Good business are making free cash flow. Bonus points if free cash flow covers CapEx, operating expenses, dividends, and leaves money left over.

Sometimes I look at the payout ratio. If I'm chasing a dividend, I don't want a business with a high payout ratio. My highest payout is a bank @ 50%. I would like room for the dividend to grow. I don't consider dividend yield %. IMO its more of an indicator of market sentiment of a stock.

It sounds kind of lame, but once I got a bit more experienced with financial statements, it really only takes 5 minutes. Honestly, its become fun.

If these numbers seem OK or interesting (and I'm genuinely interested in the company), I would read through the 10k more thoroughly to try to understand what management is thinking. I find this tedious and time consuming, but it helps me understand what is going on.

If I'm still interested, I will check the stock price and see what I think of the current valuation. If the current valuation seems reasonable to me, I'll look for a DCF (or dividend growth model or something) from someone. I find these things tedious build so I always Hope someone else has already done the math exercise for me. If I am feeling really motivated I'll go find all the data and build it myself. (I learned to do this in post secondary school)

Finally, If buying this business still seems like a good idea, I have to consider what I want to sell. Do I think this business is better than what I have?? 

That's generally how I approach my own due diligence. Since I took this approach, my portfolio has stopped swinging 20% either way in a day. I haven't had any crazy gains either. So far, this has mostly prevented me from losing money, while getting me market average/slightly above gains. 

I'm definitely not going to be buying a lambo/yacht anytime soon :(",,gyijvyl,t3_neqitj

Holding on to a short position like this when hedge funds are being targeting by retail investors (GME), the market is irrational, you’ve already made bank (I assume if he entered these in Dec then he has made bank) seems risky, greedy, and fruitless. I don’t have a source or document proving it. I just feel bad for those who don’t see that the short is most likely fully completed and may run off to buy puts. Just be careful people. 

Note, I expect additional drop but nothing to the extent it did from dec til now. I also expect fund manager to exploit this news once people reactively either 1- sell or 2- buy puts. So be careful.

The lump sum as well as any monthly difference in monthly payment goes into a Fidelity brokerage account with 100% invested into FZROX (VTSAX/VTI equivalent). It's liquid and will not be touched for anticipated term of the mortgage. It will be there for any home related emergencies as well, although we keep an emergency fund. 

I do not personally believe this is taking on risk as it's highly unlikely the market won't return 3% over the course of 30 years. I look at it as prudent arbitrage. That's always risk. You could lose your job and still have to pay property taxes. Keeping it liquidated means it's there to be used in emergencies.

There could be a concern about falling oil prices, the optics of fossil fuel investments, the flub on Berkshire's stake in Petrochina some years ago, and the new paradigm ... as transportation companies push toward automated, electric trucking to slash costs and grow margins, that could drive demand for petroleum even further down.  The U.S. represents at least 26% of the world's petroleum consumption.  Transportation jobs account for 9% of the workforce.

2020 is not a great example since near to 30% of mandatory spending was on covid relief

Mandatory spending is largely on old people expenses, SSI, healthcare, pensions. This will be one problematic due to demographic changes and increasing healthcare costs. I don’t see the US government going insolvent before the boomers die off, however

Looking for long term rental property investing. Where I currently live, the apartments are built in '60 and a very rich family owns roughly 100-200 properties under the same brand (really average apartments) - NYC - 2 bdr is roughly $2200 per month... I am really inspired by this and thought to make a plan!

My focus will be foreign country (where I was born) where the capital city \[center\] averages about $40,000 to $60,000 for 450-650 square feet studio - 1 bdr apartment. 

I spoke to one of my friends who recently bought an apartment for $45,000 and renting at $400 / month (kind of a studio apt). So, I have a more reserved 7% CAP rate.

I'm turning 25, have a stable job, and I have never invested before. I did some analysis of my career path and realized me working my ass off but can only afford a house at age of grey hair. I looked up for multiple streams of income which led me here.

The thing is, I watched hundreds of Youtube videos and read hundreds of articles about passive investing this week, which mostly suggests it is good to invest early and slowly build up the portfolio to multiply money. However, some sources suggest the stock market right now is extremely high because people jumped into speculative investing as they see prices going sky high, which brought the price even higher.

Knowing this is exactly why I wanted to invest, I started to question myself if I'm wrong to step into investing, but I don't want to live under debt and be the slave of the house. What would be your suggestion to me?

Idk I believe I have the fundamental investment knowledge and I have completed multiple professional learning modules about investing (ETF, options, structured warrants etc), but I am still confused.

978,2021-05-09 14:48:18,t3_n8fpef,n8fpef,investing,"So I was reading up about how the Fed can attempt to influence credit availability and long term interest rates by controlling what is used to calculate the SLR (as they did last year 1st April).

My understanding that the SLR requirements are put in place to ensure banks have enough capital with respect to their risky assets such that if they lose the assets (eg people defaulting on loans and mortgages as they did in 2007/8), they have sufficient capital to cover those potential losses such that they will not go under.

However, I have trouble understanding **why** certain things are included in the calculation, and some not. My google search has mostly been futile as the same findings are repeated about what is the SLR, what goes into its calculations. I want to understand **why** it is the case.

So to start off, the definition of the SLR =  Tier 1 Capital / Total Leverage Exposure .

1. Tier 1 Capital includes ""Common Equity Tier 1"" and ""Additional Tier 1 Capital"".
2. Total Leverage Exposure refers to ""Both on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet assets exposures"". Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think of it as assets that have a **risk of declining in value** (eg derivatives, loans, etc).

For 1, my main trouble is understanding ""Common Equity Tier 1"", which investopedia says it ""comprises a bank’s **core capital** and includes **common shares**, stock surpluses resulting from the issue of common shares, retained earnings, common shares issued by subsidiaries and held by third parties, and accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI).""

* To me, when I think of a bank's core capital, the first thing that pops into my mind would be the actual amount of cash they have (minus deposits since deposits are not factored in to the SLR anyways). But clearly I'm missing something here because cash is nowhere to be seen. I was thinking that that it is better expressed in the form of retained earnings, because that would have accounted for any expenses and liabilities.
* Another thing is the bank's own common shares being considered core capital. While I understand, if banks need to take losses on assets and continue operations, they can fall back on their retained earnings, which in a way helps buffer the losses since all these earnings are the net income accumulated over the years of operation. But can banks use their own shares for this purpose? Essentially, the question is, how can **banks use their own shares to protect themselves from asset loss**? How do shares play that role? Honestly I think I'm carrying one big misunderstanding somewhere, and hope someone can shed some light into it.

Now, for 2, the Fed introduced a temporary change on 1st April 2020 (and which has since expired) where ""the change would exclude **U.S. Treasury securities** and **deposits at Federal Reserve Banks** from the calculation of the rule "". This effectively lowers the denominator for the banks, increasing their SLR and giving them more leeway to **lend out their capital (cash), providing credit for the economy**, and also allows them to **park more of their (non-productive) cash into US treasury bonds (which give interest), thus lowering bond yields**, helping the Fed control long term interest rates. These two outcomes, as per my understanding, was why the Fed allowed this change in light of the Covid shock to markets and the economy.

* I can understand and accept that US treasury securities, although almost considered to be risk-free, are still debt assets (which are inherently risky), and hence included into the equation in which banks have to hold a certain amount of capital against. What I don't understand is why deposits at the Federal Reserve Banks are included. My understanding is that banks, instead of keeping excess reserves/deposits with themselves, they can deposit them with the Fed and get a small interest on it (better than nothing). But why is this considered into the equation? Will these assets (deposits at the Fed) **have a risk of being lost if the Fed is somehow unable to return them**?? If yes, what situation will it be where the Fed cannot return the deposits? If no, why is it part of the SLR equation, and why is there a need to hold capital against it?
* When the expiry was drawing near, and as banks were lobbying the Fed to extend this SLR change, one of the reasons I saw was that banks would have to ""decrease deposits (pushing savers out of holding deposits)"", essentially meaning turning away people who want to deposit money with the bank. **Why would reverting the change mean that banks have to turn away deposits?**
* After the expiry of the change, the fear that banks would now have to sell treasury bonds to meet SLR requirements (and cause a rise in yields that would hamper economic recovery) did not materialize. Instead, it was reported that banks were raising cash by issuing debt. This would imply that this increases their core capital. Why is this possible when cash is not included in the definition of core capital? After all, this also has a net neutral effect on their balance sheet, since the increase in cash will be offset by an increase in liabilities to their creditors.

As one can see from my myriad of questions, I'm definitely no banker or accountant or whatever, in fact just a barely 20 y/o kid trying to learn more about the financial world. My understanding towards the SLR is probably ridden with misunderstanding and would really appreciate if people, or actual bankers over here, can help me clear it up.",Understanding the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR),,

A bit of context here: I’m a chartered accountant working in senior management at a real estate developer. I have experience in valuations across most asset classes (stocks / real estate / business valuations etc). 

This is the first time I have ever seen every single asset class so substantially inflated: stocks, real estate, crypto currency. Whatever it is, every asset class is at all time highs. We all know the reasons why this is the case: excessive money printing & all time low interest rates have created a yield hungry environment with inflated asset prices. 

I don’t want to waste time talking about why this is the case, but I would like to know, what are you doing to protect yourself against the eventual correction in asset prices? 

Quite honestly, I’m not sure what to do here. You either hold money in cash and risk missing out on further price appreciation, or you are fully invested and exposed to asset price corrections.  Thoughts?",Asset valuations - how are you protecting yourself?,,
980,2021-05-09 16:21:06,t3_n8hkut,n8hkut,investing," Ray Dalio, the master of the LinkedIn essay and co-CIO of a minor hedge fund, is the subject of the next installment of investing styles. Ray’s All-Weather Fund is a risk-parity approach to investing, an approach that aims to diversify equal risk amongst a set of assets that have minimal or negative correlation in the event of rising or falling growth and inflation across the world economy.

The set of assets in Ray’s approach is wider than most individual investors consider: Emerging Market Credit, Corporate Credit, and Commodities, in addition to equities and bonds. Ray’s selection of assets in his risk-parity fund was driven by his belief that there are 2 core environmental drivers of markets - growth and inflation. Different assets in the portfolio perform under the 4 possible combinations of rising or falling growth and rising or falling inflation. Rather than allocating solely to assets that perform well over a falling inflation/falling growth regime, he spread the allocation over assets that perform under each of the four possible regimes. Helpful grid of the assets that perform in each regime here: [https://imgur.com/HnQ3Qp0](https://imgur.com/HnQ3Qp0). Since the market is forward-looking, what matters for classifying the regime is not just the direction of growth and inflation, but whether or not the direction is already expected, and thus priced into the market. You want to have assets that are durable when inflation or growth surprises to the upside/downside. 

Now for the controversial element of risk-parity: leverage. Rather than allocating an equal dollar amount to each of the assets outlined above, the allocation strategy is to employ leverage on lower volatility assets to achieve higher mean return at the cost of higher volatility and of the interest rate of the borrowed dollars used to lever. For example, if you have an asset with a 2% historical mean return and 5% historical volatility then you could achieve a higher expected mean return by leveraging the asset 2x to increase the expected mean return to 4% while expected volatility is now 10%. Additionally, you should expect to pay some interest rate on the margin used to implement the leverage.

The decision of how much to lever is usually set by targeting a total portfolio volatility and then giving each asset in the portfolio an equal volatility budget. If it’s a lower volatility asset, for example TIPS or investment grade corporate bonds, then the leverage ratio is higher. But for a volatile asset like equities there may be no leverage at all since the existing asset volatility already meets the volatility budget.

It isn’t intuitive how in theory applying leverage in this way can actually decrease portfolio volatility over time so it’s helpful to compare a 60/40 equities bond portfolio against the risk-parity allocation to equities and bonds. In the 60/40 portfolio the total portfolio volatility is dominated by the equity component. In the risk-parity portfolio the same mean-return as the 60/40 portfolio could be achieved with lower volatility by allocating less to equities and more to bonds and applying leverage. If you are a nerd and interested in more theory about portfolio allocation strategies under risk parity I recommend this AQR overview: [https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/White-Papers/Understanding-Risk-Parity](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/White-Papers/Understanding-Risk-Parity) 

So how does Ray think the average Joe should invest using this risk-parity theory jumbo? Well, he did an interview with Tony Robbins in 2015 suggesting a 55% allocation to US bonds but every recent interview is about cash being trash, US bonds being dumb and investing in Asia. If you happened to have a couple billion dollars you could directly invest in his hedge fund but for us poors we’re stuck with mutual funds and ETFs. The central idea of risk-parity can be applied in your own portfolio by diversifying among assets that will perform well in different regimes. If your portfolio doesn’t have any assets that perform well under a rising inflation/rising growth regime then consider looking into commodity ETFs and inflation-linked bonds.  


The choice to use leverage as a retail investor is harder to recommend than the ideas around diversification. The theory of leveraging lower volatility assets in order to achieve higher return makes sense but there are downsides. One is that retail investors will pay higher costs to use leverage, either in high-fees for leveraged ETFs or in higher margin fees than institutions. The other, perhaps more relevant, risk for retail is failure to manage the risk of leveraged assets well. There must be rebalancing between assets to maintain the risk budgets of each asset and if the correlations of assets within the portfolio change then the fundamental assumption of assets performing under different regimes can be violated and leverage ratios should be managed accordingly. Another option is to trust a mutual fund or robo-advisor to manage this risk-parity approach for you, but as noted above the implementation matters and the fee drag of expensive risk-parity products should be considered.  


Hopefully you can take some ideas about allocating risk across your portfolio, considering other asset classes, and the performance of your portfolio under different market regimes into your own investing style. Next time, I will cover Christopher Cole’s long term investing style which aims to protect against the tail events that even risk-parity funds do not handle well.

5 yr return:  37.78%

Standard deviation:  44.29  My account has high volatility

Sharpe ratio:  .83  My account's risk adjusted return.  My account has high returns but has had endure very high volatility to achieve those returns.  For comparison S&P Sharpe ratio for the past 5 years is 1.09.  Higher is better.

Risk adjusted alpha:  7.01 A risk adjusted measure that measure's excess returns over an index.  Higher is better.  I have achieved higher than average returns compared to the index

Beta:  2.06 Measures volatility related to an index which has a beta of 1.  Higher means more volatility.  My account has been very volatile compared to the index

R2:  .48 Measures correlation with an index.  Lower number means low correlation with an index.  My account has low correlation with the index.

993,2021-05-07 23:59:52,t3_n7cmlw,n7cmlw,investing,"Recent interview of Cathie Wood on CNBC (search YouTube for ""I love this setup, rotation is good news"" to find video) got my head scratching around the math she just did in her statements. Back in February she said she expects 15% YoY compounded returns in next 5 years when ARK funds (say ARKK) was around 140 (down from 160 high) which now slid to 110 this week in May.

She said in that CNBC interview ""Nothing has changed but the price"" and now expects 25-30% YoY compounded returns in next 5 years.

So by simple math 

140*(1.15^5) = 281 back then

Now she's promising : between

110*(1.25^5) = 335

and 110*(1.3^5) = 408

That's almost 20-50% higher but if nothing has changed then how does the number grow so much more in end result ? I don't follow the math or logic here.

Also, let's say give here benefit of doubt and say back in February she meant ARK price numbers that were in Jan 21 for YoY growth of 15% but then price was even lower between 120-140. So I don't know if she's bluffing (I'm gonna guess saving her skin and fund outflows) and taking us for a ride or is she really onto something that we don't know ?

Since the demand for telehealth skyrocketed in 2020, it’s been a super hot sector with not only a lot of investments, but a lot of new players in the arena. As I’ve debated on which company to put my stake in, I’ve always had an eye on Amwell. It’s consistently been under the target price since it’s IPO and I think there’s a ton of potential here.

Fueling my logic is a recent WSJ article about how PepsiCo has switched telehealth platforms. The company stopped using Teledoc for telemedicine services and now uses LiveHealth Online, a platform connected to the company’s health plan that also happens to be powered by Amwell technology. 

I feel as though this revelation flew under the radar. If Amwell runs platforms that integrate better with company’s current health plans, it could become a serious competitor to Teledoc. Head of benefits at PepsiCo, Erik Sossa, says “Telehealth is a fantastic medium, but if it’s just late-night urgent care, it’s kind of a commodity.” This is true and I think this statement will guide the “what’s next” in the telehealth industry. With so many companies entering the market, what will set each one apart? Making it easier on employers by integrating with what already exists is a great way to gain a step-up on competitors. 

I’ll be continuing to keep a close watch on Amwell. The stock can only go up from here—and many analysts agree. Numbers look good and recent news suggests that the company is headed in a great direction.

Just anecdotal but I like what they offer a lot. 

I'd probably also say something similar about VGAC/ME (VGAC is Virgin SPAC which will turn into 23&me stock) but I haven't personally checked out 23&me though I know they are very popular and I'd be very surprised if ME ends up lower than VGAC, I'd peg ME at at least 2x what VGAC is at, but I'm a little new to investing so do research but I think those two SPACs are likely undervalued wrt the stocks they will turn into",,gyiwmfj,t1_gyhv50k

Zimbabwe got rid of farmers who had generations of farming knowledge. The government gave the land to people who had no clue about how to run a farm, and then people started starving in what was once called the bread basket of Africa. 

The government won't dismantle the mine, but they may well appropriate their vehicles to some nonsensical endeavor somewhere else. Like: If some politician's nephew wants to try out a truffle farm and decides that trucks are needed, those trucks will be taken from wherever they're available, and if that's a nickel mine - so be it. This example may well happen even without nepotism. If the government decides that nickel isn't what is going to get produced, then the mine will shut down and workers and equipment will be moved somewhere else.

""As long as something can be produced there will be profits"" - this is nonsensical. If that were the case, there would not be a single unprofitable venture anywhere. Just because something is produced, doesn't mean someone will want it enough to exchange something else of value for it.

People run businesses and operations. It seems like you think every operator of any venture is interchangeable, but we have ample evidence that this isn't the case. Farmers in Zimbabwe either know how to run a farm, or they don't. Mining experts either know how to run a mine or they don't.

I have been trying to get into a group of local investors who renovate and flip properties and then use the gains to purchase long term multifamily rental properties. I was finally invited into the group and need to fund first property. My issue right now is cash on hand. I had a lot of my ""learning money"" that I've used and grown for years learning the market stuck at a 46% loss from WKHS, NIO, LMND, AND SKLZ all tanked during a week I was out of touch with the world. I've been holding for the eventual upturn sometime down the road but I need about 30k for the hard money loan to start to renovate and flip the property I've been assigned. 

My question is should I bite the bullet and take the loss by using the 30ish left in that account. Then use the capital gains losses to help offset my cryptocurrency gains which have been substantial this year. Or do I hold and try to find another place to pull the money from but could potentially lose my position within the group.
 
I've also done my DD on the group looking through the LLC records and public Financials and how it's structured. I'm very confident in their process and not worried about it failing although thr profits are long term realization and not quick since the profits are reinvested for more properties.

In that case, it makes sense to outsource the running of the mine to foreign companies. Those are foreign investments by the way - money is coming into the country from abroad in the form of an investment, and those investments pay for the local labor. On top of that, the government taxes the profits from the mine. 

If by ""extraction"" you mean that natural resources are being extracted - well, that's exactly right. I've always found it fascinating how people, especially left-leaning self-proclaimed environmentalists, demand electrification due to it being more climate-friendly, but when you ask them if they'd allow for extracting battery metals, ten times out of ten they say: ""No, you shouldn't build that mine.""

So my question is, naturally, who is going to do without electrification since we need battery and other metals to do the electrification, but if we're not allowed to extract them, that means that everyone will not benefit from electrification and they will thus have to power their society using fossil fuels. 

So left-leaning environmentalists demand something they're absolutely not willing to allow to happen, just so that they can look down on people who they themselves force to use fossil fuels.

I wouldn't be so sure. There are two analogous situations I can think of where investors expected stocks to soar after legalization: alcohol stocks at the end of Prohibition, and Canadian marijuana stocks upon legalization. In both cases, the anticipation overshot reality, and it turned out that there wasn't a secret horde of consumers who desired alcohol or cannabis, but had been too worried about legal ramifications to consume; in both cases, black market supply chains continued uninterrupted, reducing the number of retail consumers, but there also turned out to just not be a huge untapped market. Everyone overestimated how many people consumed those products.

Once companies started generating legal revenues and publishing actual numbers instead of just fantasies, stock prices came crashing down hard. On top of lower revenues than anticipated, a lot of the companies weren't run very efficiently and were consistently losing money. 

Buying into a stock in the hopes that an illegal substance will someday become legal is pure speculation. Guessing which stocks in that industry will have solid financial performance after legalization may happen at some point in the future is, in my opinion, like throwing a pair of dice on a roulette wheel and hoping that they land as a seven on 00.",,gyj25eq,t1_gyivajc

They've been private for the last 9 years.  Based on their reporting over the last 2 quarters theyve generated over $3B this year alone.  Sure, they profit from volume. which is why they are adding more assets, they also profit from custodial services and institutional buying.  They have a venture capital arm, they are now offering crypto based loans, stakng, payments, defi and other services.  Coinbase is more than just an exchange.

> And btw, that’s still a really high fee if you’re trading large sums. Plus they are taking the premium on the bid/ask spread.

It's a high fee, but I choose to accept the premium based on the service they offer.  They provide me more options than other exchange services offering crypto for sale.  Sure, competition is coming but even the ""free trading"" movement isn't truly free because you become the product not the customer as we see with Robnhood.  The breadth of services Coinbase offers, the ease of use for on ramping to crypto and the fact they have a great reputation and are a publicly traded company make them an appealing place to do business.  The competition that might be coming in coming may ironically be enabled by Coinbase providing crypto trading and custodial services to other major brokerages.

> I don’t foresee crypto ever being an actual medium of payment for physical assets unless it is pegged to a real currency. Too much volatility. Maybe that eventually goes away, who knows. But gold and silver have never stopped being volatile, and I see them as physical equivalents. A currency which is backed by nothing other than sentiment is subject to wild swings.

It already is.  Billions of dollars transact in dollar based stablecons every sngle day.  And not to burst your bubble but all currencies are volatile and thats why theres people who trade on FOREX.  The US dollar in particular is inflating at a higher than expected rate, causing investors to chase yields in an overinflating speculative stock market bubble.  Bitcoin and crypto can exist and be pegged to whatever localized value is required at the point of sale.  It's just another method of exchanging value, like the tokenized assets we trade on the stock market.  Bitcoin is more lke gold, it's got a finite supply, true digital scarcity and the bitcoin blockchain is the most secure vault in the world, that's available 24/7, around the world, and is liquid across almost every fiat and crypto asset in existence.  It's deflationary properties make it a better place to store wealth as more gold and silver could be found.  It's a currency backed by the aggregated hash power of the bitcoin network and electricity.  It has created an entire infrastructure from scratch and allows technological innovation in banking and finance that is just as revolutionary as the internet was to communications.  

Crypto does have bull and bear markets but here we are again blowing away your expectations for what is possible except this time we have companies going public, visa and mastercard announcing support for crypto payments, paypal offering them to users and major financial institutions hiring engineers and building out departments.  

Jamie Dimon calls it the biggest competitive threat his industry will face over the next 10 years.  Because imagine Facebooks cryptocurrency, which is backed by nothing, being introduced to their network.  Where Facebook pays users for participation or to receive advertising.  Where those 2.8B users can now use those Facebucks to buy things on Facebook, either through Facebook Marketplace with 800m users transacting in 70 different countries every month or 2.8B users around the globe being offered financial services by Facebook.  Facebook could become the biggest financial institution on the planet just by employing cryptocurrency in a very targeted way.  That's what makes Jamie Dimon wake up in a cold sweat because he only has 55M digital banking customers and crypto makes it possible for Big Tech to offer the same kind of services to investors large or small that JP Morgan and other banks offer only to the very wealthy.

And brokerages and other assorted middleman?  They can be cut right out of the picture with this technology.  Hate crypto all you want, but if it can save a company billions in costs you better believe they are going to find a way to use it to their competitive advantage.  Crypto isn't some flash in the pan, its the next logical extension of the internet and its coming for the finance and banking industry.

Coinbase is one of the best positioned companies in this space and already has investments in many of these projects that can revolutionize finance.  They will even be part of the discussion when it comes to regulations on the space.  You're not buying picks during a gold rush, you're buying Amazon at the start of the dot com boom knowing they are going to be much more than a company that matches buyers and sellers and collects a fee.",,gyj6xty,t1_gyizy9p

1206,2021-05-18 05:10:28,t1_gyjaku0,,investing,"If you are investing passively for long term gains then the philosophy is - time in the market over timing the market. In otherwords no one can say whether we have reached a peak or not, if you choose not to buy right when you have the funds available then you are saying you have the ability to know the future and are waiting to buy at a lower price. That thinking will prevent you from ever investing in the first place and missing out on gains as you wait for a pull back.

People were saying we were due for a bear market from 2012 until we just crashed in 2020. If you had waiting to buy when you had money in 2012 not only would you have missed out on years of gains, but you probably would have bought as the market continued to fall and lost money on the way down. Alternatively if you bought in 2012 and just continued to hold the market recovered and is now at all time highs, giving you a great return.",,gyjaku0,t1_gyiqijm
1207,2021-05-18 05:10:46,t1_gyjalsd,,investing,"Personally I think Amazon is valued in a way which is optimistic but not wholly unjustified (big market share, huge leg up on competition, head start on all the tricky logistics, the company does make money but spends it all on new infrastructure, etc…) 

Tesla is valued as if they’ll have a monopoly on not just electric cars but all passenger vehicles for the next decade at least. That, or people are doing the math and discounting Tesla stock as if it’s a much safer place to keep their money than cash. It makes absolutely no sense unless some truly unbelievable things happen. We can argue about what the things are or how realistic some might be, but for Tesla to be valued even at its current price in 10 years things need to go insanely well for the company.

I get why people like the company generally but IMO people have bid the stock price up to a level where even though the company is solid it’s unimaginable to me that shareholders are going to make anything other than speculative profit for quite some time.

Getting back to Amazon, hypothetically let’s say that once Bezos steps down they decide to not ever grow again and just pay a dividend. Suddenly I think the stock would look pretty attractive - obviously they’re not going to do that, but in a way the focus on growth *is* the dividend. Point being that intentionally having a low EPS in order to grow the business faster and having that make your P/E high (what Amazon does) is a lot different than the price being astronomical based on hype and unreasonable speculation and having that make your P/E high.

Just my $0.02 as some Schmuck on the internet.

Wow, good call. I guess if you hit a bullseye after a million tries you can call yourself skilled. 

What's ""controversial"" is the contention in your original post that the timing of the pullback was so obvious, while also saying getting it right is luck. A pullback from an ATH is obvious? Well then, it's not really broken clock lucky guess to figure that out is it? Of course, if you had figured it out, maybe you could have made millions like Burry.

>Burry has been saying Tesla is overvalued for years, so it's not like he all of a sudden came to the conclusion to short.

No, he hasn't. Tesla's massive run up was mostly over the last year, so that doesn't really add up. As far as I can recall, he first announced he was bearish on Tesla in December. And evidently, he made his bet against in in Q1, at or around the time it hit his all time high. Considering the fall since then, he's undoubtedly made a lot of money, so pretty smart move. Which again, if it was so obvious, why didn't you do the same?

>He also believes the entire market is going to crash again soon and has been saying so for years. At some point, he's going to be right just like a broken clock.

You can't really do that when it comes to shorting, since you will lose a ton of money keeping a failing short position open, or at the very least, eat a lot of put option premiums. He was right to the tune of hundreds of millions by being precise about timing his bearish bet.",,gyjbebw,t1_gyi8ih2

(I have about 5K savings and 5k invested in a index tracking ETF Australian dollars)

If it's possible to get really high returns when you don't have much money I was thinking of learning stock trading through trading fake stock and reading etc. With a goal of getting very high returns until I actually have decent capital.

I am going to University soon and have a job but if I leave the job the government will give me a small income whist I am at University.

I wanted to work on a side business whist at University so I have the chance to try and be self employed so I am able to travel whist working and pick my own hours.

I want to know if getting very high returns is realistic whist I don't have much capital as that could act as my ""business"" to get me started.",If you don't have much money can you get really high % returns?,,

1275,2021-05-18 06:19:14,t1_gyjg1d3,,investing,"In terms of revenue, sure I guess we can put that question aside. But the question is how much revenue is generated outside of the last two or three quarters aka, a normal year. Not the last two quarters. 

Coinbase generates what like 92% or something of revenue from transactions? The other services you mentioned are basic things that a bank does. When they have assets to borrow against, they can do that. Like I said, I’m not short coin so I am not completely familiar with all of their financials and how many assets they have to borrow against. Servicing institutions will never be a large driver of revenue. The transactions are too few and far between. 

On fees, 0.5% remains high. That’s a 50 dollar fee for a 10k transaction. Even if you charged twenty dollars for a trade, as brokers did back in the day, it would be much cheaper. 0.5% is really high. And the vast majority of people on coinbase are paying a much higher fee. But hey, when the money is flowing, who cares about a paltry percent or two. It just keeps on going up baby. 

The second argument for saying coinbase, as a company, has value is that they are a leader in the crypto currency space. 

The technology appears to have promise, but much like the dotcom bubble, crypto currencies have exponentially increased in price based on pure speculation. 

Coinbase is the poster child for this speculation. They have no claim on the blockchain technology, and what they do is not and cannot be unique. If brokerages and middlemen are to be cutout, then Coinbase would be to, because they are the middle man. Robinhood likely does crypto volume which is many multiples of coinbase. But coinbase makes more money because of fees. And coinbase charges the big institutions fractions of what they charge little guys. Go figure. They are valued as a $50b company serving a market that is only ~2 trillion usd. That’s insane. They are only an intermediary. 

In terms of cryptocurrency, I think that some might have value after the speculative fervor subsides, but it’s hard to know which ones. I am of the opinion that Bitcoin will go to zero. 

Bitcoin has no value other than what others are willing to pay for it. This is obvious. Bitcoin especially is a lousy argument to say that blockchain technology is more efficient than any other current payment system. It consumes an insane amount of energy. Saying something is finite is irrelevant and does not make it true. If something can be forked, how does that make it finite? 

There are other blockchains, like ethereum, which seem to be useful. But I don’t think your argument talks about network effects of a blockchain. How does having more users increase the value of a network? 

FOREX is not volatile with respect to Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies. That’s simply untrue. While it may be volatile in some respects, inflation of the USD has averaged 2% or less for the last ten years. Inflation of the USD is done on purpose by a central monetary system.

Crypto currency networks are promising in that a currency is created. But really, it’s the blockchain technology behind it that has the value. Currencies must be supported by a government in order to have long lasting value. That’s how modern civilizations work. The currencies are supported by the governments. If a government collapses, so will the currency. The US is nowhere close to that. Any currency which is backed only by the lack of faith in civilization will forever be volatile. Gold is the case and point here. It goes up during times of fear. The case is made again and again about the value of gold as countries collapse. It’s an age-old cycle. 

If Jamie Dimon were losing sleep over zuckbucks, he wouldn’t be the CEO of the biggest bank in the United States. They are developing blockchain technology. But it’ll be a while, and at this point it doesn’t seem like it’s better than current solutions.",,gyjg1d3,t1_gyj6xty
