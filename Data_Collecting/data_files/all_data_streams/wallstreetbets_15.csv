Without pooling this is completely impractical but when pooling gets here this will be true. Atharium (you know the one) will ROI in around 120 days, possibly a LOT longer starting in July due to fees burning in EIP 1559. For this currency to ROI in 120 days, the network needs to 6-8x in size. That's assuming price of the currency doesn't change. If the network continues growing at the rate that it is, we may see all of this complete before this quarter is over. 

In summary, this is the most profitable currency until the network hits 50 exabytes, in which case it becomes the second most profitable UNLESS EIP 1559 hurts mining in which case it can remain the most profitable for much longer.

There are also cases to be made for the price to increase over time as well, but I'm assuming you know as much about it as I do and I can't really talk about it here without triggering automod.",,

563,,2021-05-19 19:52:31,t3_ngfajd,,wallstreetbets,"Alright ladies and gentlemen.... mostly just gentlemen. Hopefully y'all ain't gentle because this time we going HARD! I will be talking about Switch. A company that provides data centers to some of the world's most secure clientele.

  
What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either. 

Here is some better and more thought out DD:

568,,2021-05-19 20:14:45,t3_ngftx1,,wallstreetbets,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",ngftx1,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Mr. Cramer..."
569,,2021-05-19 20:21:49,t3_ngg05f,,wallstreetbets,"Ever since the Feb peak, the sell pressure has been high and news pieces coming out one after another to give investors reason to sell. Sector rotation, tech bubble fear, jump in 10-year treasury rate marked the beginning of inflation fear. And mistrust in FED that JPOW will not raise interest rate until at least 2023.

Big tech's earnings absolutely destroyed estimates but sell side thinks it's due to lock down and people will rely on tech less once things open up. It's a consistent pattern that all the gains made after earning erode overnight or in a few trading session as if the good earning did not happen. 

At the same time, the indexes are still hover around all time high. Remember how excited this sub was when SPY edging $400 and we are now still at $410. Meanwhile small growth stocks have 5% - 10% up and down days regularly and overall down 30% - 50% from ATH. 

The pre-market can be deeply red and the day can end slightly green or close to it like today.  Market can reverse anytime in any direction like playing Uno reverse card. 

The world is still hella messy. Fear of second covid wave in Europe, Asia, and even America. Big government wants to spend trillions of dollars. More spending and more stimulus so the market should go up right? Wait a second, how about inflation? 

Same information, mixed understanding, and complete opposite decision on the market. So far, the sell side seems winning but the market seems to be really confused on where it should go.",ngg05f,Market is in a hella messy state and only certain thing is high volatility

I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made.

Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

573,,2021-05-19 21:25:26,t3_nghmhm,,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",nghmhm,$NUE is strong as steel. Buy the dips.

Petco earnings is tomorrow pre-market. But this also might be a potential candidate for a short squeeze.

Short sellers are gearing up for a bad quarter. For the last three days, the short float increased from 4 point-something Monday, 6.05 yesterday, and today it's at 8.75.

In addition, short interest is up to 35.2%

To top it off, there are hardly any shares available to short, though borrowing rate remains at only 1%. For the last five days there were no more than 100k shares left to short.

585,,2021-05-20 05:24:49,t3_ngrqqf,,wallstreetbets,"Some context: Cell carriers in the US have decided to stop the function of shared short codes (5-6 digit phone numbers) June 1. Shared short codes were the preferred means of SMS and MMS communication for B2C traffic. Short codes were free to lease in many cases, text messages were cheap, thousands of businesses could send from the same number, and throughput was incredibly high (lots of messages could be sent very fast).

The new policy enforced by the CTIA (The private club all major cell phone carriers are in) is that shared short codes are to be discontinued and replaced by dedicated short codes and A2P 10dlc (approved B2C traffic on 10-digit phone numbers). This means that every business/organization that wants to send texts must either apply for a dedicated short code or apply for a 10DLC. 

Dedicated short codes are the preferred choice for large corporations. They can handle large throughput and look good for the brand. However, they only cater to large corporations because they are thousands of dollars/year to lease. Turn around time for application is 4-6 weeks. Barrier to entry is high.

10DLC is the preferred choice for the smaller businesses since it's less expensive. But, it is still far more expensive than the shared short codes businesses are used to, requires application, and costs $50/mo in carrier and registration fees alone. Turn around time for application is less than a week. On top of fees, 10dlc isn't even fully ready. The Campaign Registry, the organization responsible for rolling out ""the new messaging standard"" for the CTIA, is still developing their API.

Enter Toll-free messaging. TF has 0 barrier to entry and can be issued to a business with SMS and MMS capabilities in seconds. It's the easiest and now the most cost-effective way to send commercial messages.

Conveniently, every major carrier announced this month (for the first time) that they will start collecting a $0.0025/message fee for every sms sent. They're ready for and expecting businesses to move to this method.

Who is Zipwhip: Zipwhip was given full reign over all TF traffic. Anyone in the US  that wants to send messages on TF codes uses Zipwhip in one way or another. They are a massive reseller that everyone is required to go through.

It was recently announced the Twilio plans on acquiring Zipwhip for $850M. Twilio is the leader is programmable messaging hands down. 

Honestly, there should be antitrust issues that arise and block the acquisition. If it goes through, Twilio owns the new world of business sms. Good chance regulators won't notice any issue. They'll miss the fact that businesses will be pressured into TF over their preferred solutions (dedicated short codes and A2P 10DLC) since it's unnecessarily complicated and expensive. TF is ready now and cheap.

TL;DR if Twilio successfully acquires Zipwhip, every small to medium sized business that wants to send texts will have to go through them. Every single one of them in the US.",ngrqqf,$TWLO stands to be the primary source for commercial text messaging

588,,2021-05-20 08:25:07,t3_ngulnq,,wallstreetbets,"So just how big is **today's news about the initial success of the Sofusa technology**?

1st, this is a technology that aims at lymphatic delivery. 

**What does this mean?** Well, when trying to fight a disease, it's difficult to target the lymphatic system. Because of how it works and the fact that it is spread throughout our body. 

So there are MANY, MANY drugs out there that treat several conditions through the lymphatic system. But, because of what we just explained, those drugs sometimes don't work. They are not properly ""delivered"". They don't get to where they need to get to make the necessary interaction and solve the problem.

**Sorrento has developed a technology that can deliver drugs to where they actually need to go** in the lymphatic system. So this is definitely breakthrough technology. Other companies are aiming to find similar solutions. But we are definitely talking about very advanced bio-tech.

In this case, we have a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. This is a condition that worsens with time. It's very painful and limits the patient's movement. It's not very common, so we are talking about 1.5 million people in the USA and about 30 million worldwide. 

But remember, **the technology Sorrento is developing  will be able to deliver drugs treating many other diseases** related to the lymphatic system. So the market for Sofusa is very, very large.

The press release tells us Sofusa was tested on ""First Enbrel-Non-Responding"" patients. 

**What does this mean?** Patients who need the drug Enbrel and, even though they have not been taking the drug for long (it's a ""first"" for them) they are not responding to it. It isn't helping them. 

Now, Sofusa comes into play. It's job is to deliver Enbrel to the patient effectively. To ""take"" Enbrel to where it needs to go in the lymphatic system.. 

The 1st obvious advantage is that the drug wasn't helping and now helps. But there are other important advantages.

Since the drug is being carried to its targeted ""destination"" the dosage needed, diminishes. Because less is ""lost along the way"". This is important because many diseases related to the lymphatic system, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are chronic, lifelong conditions. Being able to administer less drugs really helps the patient. Now you have a drug that actually works, more potently, which reduces its dosage. All this thanks to Sorrento.

The press release points out an important factor: This is a trial on ONE type of drug/treatment. Other such trials testing the effectiveness of Sofusa are already taking place. Again, this is proof of the potentially huge market for this delivery system.

Just to get an idea, the release mentions anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. These are a type of drugs that inhibit the activity of certain proteins (they inhibit PD1 and CTLA4, which are types of proteins. By stopping their activity, they help in stopping the growth of cancer tumors). There are several drugs that fall under these categories and treat a wide variety of cancers. **Sofusa can potentially play a vital role in all these treatments**. 

This is like several companies developing apps while Sorrento is developing a new smartphone technology. Each app has its rightful use and market. But once the new smartphone is up and working, all apps will need it. So this technology has huge revenue implications. T**he fact we are hearing good news about it is HUGE**.

As for the results themselves: **The DAS28 test measures rheumatoid activity in 28 joints** in the patient's body. The joints might be swollen or tender (hurting).

This patient had a DAS28 score of 4.6, with 18 out of 28 joints compromised.  That is considered  moderate to high disease activity.  There are 4 levels of DAS 28 scores going from remission (the best) to high (the worst). So this patient was not in the worst shape going in, but pretty bad.

Using Sofusa to deliver the Enbrel drug, in just 4 weeks (this is a very short time for this type of disease!!) the results went from 4.6 to 3.0. The total amount of compromised joints, from 18 to 11. **That is a dramatic change**. The patient went from being somewhere between level 3 and 4, to being in the lower level 2, called ""low disease activity"", which indicates it's moving towards remission (the lowest level). For someone suffering from this condition, it's a real life changer. For the company selling Enbrel, it's a real market changer. And if it can equally help people with tumors, **Sofusa becomes a major therapeutic factor.** 

I hope investors understand this. **It's another major development in an already extremely promising pipeline** which is currently badly undervalued. If the price doesn't spike today by 10-15%, as it should, just from this news, it would be disappointing. 

But if you are long, today's price change isn't what matters the most. It‚Äôs the understanding that Sorrento / SRNE has ANOTHER ace in its hand!",ngulnq,How Big is SRNE news release about Sofusa success?

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC and its +23% run in the past week. A stock with a massive dividend. A stock trading with a very low P/E of and income growth of 4,200%.

So why is this stock still a buy and hold for me right now?

The CEO is positioning them to increase shareholder value, but also position the company to weather any reduction in the refi market. (65% of the business)

There are major catalysts that have been driving the increase in price that goes beyond the attention gained on WSB.

* Announced **NET earnings of $860M in the first quarter,** with huge margins.
* Reaffirmed a continued dividend, the next ex-dividend date is **6/9/2021**.
* Announced a **$300M stock buyback, representing as much as 40% of the free float** at the current prices.
* Russell index inclusion was missed last quarter due to confusion about their PREVIOUS status as a SPAC. It is expected that they will be reconsidered for Russell Index inclusions in the yearly reconstitution. While not the biggest catalyst, this is a sign of reputation and long-term stability for the stock. **The prelim list publishes 6/4/2021.**
* Creation of a jumbo mortgage product. The average loan origination in the market is \~410,000, indicating that the non-conforming section of the mortgage market is *exploding.* This is a very profitable sector of loan origination.

Other fundamentals driving a buy recommendation:

* Small float. 90M float, of which only about 60M is freely trading.
* This stock is not persistently pressured down quite as hard as others due to low share availability, but it appears based on the last two weeks it's trading the small waves of this stock to try to push it down under dangerous strike prices. A wave of positive sentiment could strangle this position in the stock. I don't have a Bloomberg terminal, but based on the evidence over the last several days, the indication is the 13.1% SI has grown.
* Exceptional open option interest for **tomorrow 5/21/2021.** The options expiring tomorrow have been documented elsewhere so I won't belabor them, but the open interest at the $9, and $10 strike represent almost 10% of the free float.
* Not a new startup, **they have been in this business since 1986**, making them almost as old as a fossil like me. They clearly survived the 2008 storm. This company isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

The cherry:

* **STILL forecasting growth in Q2**, whereas many of its competitors are not.

This post is NOT financial advice, but as someone who has ridden the waves of this stock since it was about $9, I see this position turning positive and the outlook through July for this position has high sentiment. Even if the mortgage market slows down as expected, I will hold these shares for years to come for the dividends and general stability of the organization.

My position 8000 shares @ 7.65 and 45x 6/18 8c. You can go stalk the fuck out of me if you want to see that I've been talking about this stock for some time and been saying the same thing about the strength and targets of their position since March. I am also the guy that tells you when you unintentionally reveal personal info on your yolo screenshots!

TLDR: UWMC should garner close attention for value investors looking for undervalued positions.

599,,2021-05-20 13:28:43,t3_nh08j4,,wallstreetbets,"**Investment Thesis**

Overall, what makes MDXG a good buying opportunity right now is a combination of two factors.

* Number one is management‚Äôs miscommunication with the market. The market currently believes that wound care is the core business of MDXG, is not entirely aware of the potential of its biopharma pipeline and more specifically its Amniofix drug, and has priced the company based on this.¬†
* Number two is the huge potential of the Amniofix treatment and its ability to become the next blockbuster in the healthcare space after the conclusion of its phase 3 trial.

**Idea Summary**

MiMedx Group *(MDXG)* is a leading BioPharma and wound care business whose value has been drastically misunderstood by the market. Through drivers such as miscommunication from management about the company‚Äôs valued proposition as well as the lack of institutional investor coverage, the market currently believes that the majority of the company‚Äôs value sits in its low growth wound care business. In reality, its major competitive advantage is within its osteoarthritis drug Amniofix which has the potential to become the next blockbuster after it clears phase III clinical trials. A sum of the parts valuation was used to determine a minimum implied upside of at least 300%. Risks are discussed at the end.

**Business Overview**

MiMedx Group is a leading biopharma and advanced wound care business utilizing human placental tissues to develop products used in the healthcare sector. It processes placental tissues using its patented processes to produce allografts, which are tissues transplanted from one person to another for wound care and regeneration. These allografts are effective in healing difficult wounds because of the ability of the allograft cells to quickly associate with the cells of the patient, thereby taking part in the healing process, easing the ability of the body to close the wound, and speeding up the body‚Äôs regeneration process.

MDXG‚Äôs product offerings can be split into two business segments: wound care and biopharma (surgical solutions). Its flagship product Epifix and additional product Epicord fall under its wound care umbrella, and its flagship product Amniofix as well as additional products Amniocord, Amniofill, and Epiburn fall under its biopharma umbrella. The wound care products service the broad wound care industry, targeting specifically chronic wounds. The biopharma product line is more specific, with the flagship treatment Amniofix targeting knee osteoarthritis in specific.¬†

MDXG sells through direct sales, sales agents, and distributors in the United States. This past quarter, 95% of its sales were direct to customers such as healthcare professionals and facilities.¬†

**Internal Analysis**

The past 3 years have not been ideal for MDXG. Its revenues began to dip in 2018 around the time of their accounting scandal, the growth went from 40% in 2018, to 11% in 2019, and is currently around -16%. This sent their stock price tumbling from $16 USD to lows of almost $1 USD, though it is currently trading at $9 with new updates on their biopharma pipeline.

Their gross margin has stayed very high, around 80% while their EBITDA margins have dropped over the years. Though it wasn‚Äôt explicitly disclosed, a large part of this drop in EBITDA margins has been attributed to a temporary increase in legal fees due to the litigation MDXG has faced this past year. Its decreased volume may have also suppressed margins as the number of wound care treatments in hospitals significantly dropped during COVID-19.¬†

The company‚Äôs cash balance is sitting at a very high level of 84 mm. This is in large part due to its recent capital raise, which happened to be strongly criticized by one of MDXG‚Äôs activist investors, Prescience Point Capital (discussed in detail later).

**External Analysis**

*Wound Care Market*

The global wound care market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% from 2021 to 2028. This has been driven by the aging population and rising rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Wound care products are increasingly being used to prevent and surgical site infections.¬†

Though the overall market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% the specific advanced product segment which includes products such as those of MDXG‚Äôs which target chronic and non-healing wounds, is projected to grow much faster than 4.1%.¬†

The wound care market is relatively fragmented, with large players such as Integra LifeSciences, 3M, Johnson & Johnson, and Medtronic competing to gain the most market share. MDXG‚Äôs direct competition for its allograft advanced wound care treatments include Organogenesis, Axogen, Mediwound, and Vericel.¬†

Organogenesis is currently in the lead in this niche market, and while MDXG reported an 11% YoY decline in sales in 2020 (which has already been factored into the current price), Organogenesis reported a 30% increase. This is evident when comparing the stock performance of both companies over the past year (figure 1)

*Osteoarthritis Therapy Market*

91 million U.S. adults have arthritis, 20M have knee OA, and \~32 million per year are currently treated for plantar fasciitis, which is specifically targeted by MDXG‚Äôs Amniofix drug. There are very few FDA approved treatments for knee OA and plantar fasciitis, and those that exist have low efficacy and many drawbacks. Amniofix is currently the only treatment of its nature in phase 3 clinical trials that have posted very positive results in both company and independent trials, has been used off-label by >100K patients with zero severe adverse effects, and consistently demonstrates a significant reduction in pain as reported by patients. In addition, Amniofix has an RMAT (regenerative medicine advanced therapy) designation granted by the FDA which allows for MDXG to benefit from an expedited approval process from the FDA.

*Management Miscommunication*

The current market opinion of MDXG has been blurred by the miscommunication from company management whose goals do not align with maximizing shareholder value. This is largely due to the fact that EW healthcare, a private equity firm, has 33% representation on the board as a result of its 17% stake. From a corporate finance perspective, a private equity firm‚Äôs interests do not generally tend to align with those of public shareholders. Their influence has been exacerbated by the fact that there are no large institutional holdings in MDXG as of yet other than Prescience Point, and there has been minimal coverage on the stock leading to the market‚Äôs opinion on the company being heavily skewed by management communications.¬†

MDXG‚Äôs current growth strategy is focused on roll-ups in the wound care space. This is very characteristic of a private equity playbook, and goes alongside EW‚Äôs historical acquisitions. As was mentioned in the external analysis, the wound care space is growing at a slow rate of \~4.1%, however MDXG has lost significant market share to Organogenesis. Management has failed to realize that the current value driver of the business is within its biopharma line and not its wound care line, yet has continually communicated to shareholders that it believes it is in fact wound care and it is going to continue investing in growing within the industry.

Prescience Point Capital, an activist investor group which has advocated for change in MDXG's communication strategy, has supported the fact that MDXG‚Äôs communications have been focused on the wrong industry. At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, the potential for the drug Amniofix was drastically undersold and much time was spent convincing investors that the core business is in wound care. The 3.6% decline in shares two days after the conference illustrates how effective this strategy was.¬†

There has been strong opposition from MDXG‚Äôs board of directors to Prescience Point‚Äôs activist efforts. In a shareholder letter in early May, prior to their annual meeting, the company communicated that they believe the wound care and regenerative medicine direction being followed now is ideal. They stated that the activist investor does not understand pharmaceutical company disclosure and were advocating for speculative actions themselves though Prescience‚Äôs report discusses the opposite, with them outlining how EW‚Äôs influence on the board of directors is shifting the company‚Äôs focus away from maximizing shareholder value.

*Amniofix*

As mentioned in the external analysis, there is currently no other treatment, either in development or on the market, as effective as Amniofix in treating knee OA and also just as safe. Most recently, at its Q1 earnings call, MDXG CEO shared positive results from the phase IIb prospective trial of the treatment. There was a statistically significant reduction in VAS (visual analog score) for pain and an improvement in the foot function index score. There were also no serious adverse events during this clinical trial. Amniofix is currently in phase III trials, and MDXG believes they are on target to meet all criteria needed to find a biologics license application (BLA) so that the treatment can be introduced to the general public. MDXG is aiming to file their BLA in the first half of 2022, meaning that within a year this blockbuster treatment could be on the market, and given the feedback so far from clinical trials as well as the RMAT designation, it is highly likely.

A Prescience Point market capture analysis estimated that the treatment would bring in $4,050 million of annual sales. This is \~8 times higher than the current sales brought in through wound care. One year ago it would have been prudent to not entirely incorporate this into the share price, however today with clinical trials nearing completion and MDXG‚Äôs new RMAT designation, the likelihood of approval is much higher.

**Valuation**

From a valuation point of view, a quick sum of the parts analysis is the most ideal given the two different business lines of MDXG. A more in-depth DCF can be created once more cost information is provided from MDXG after the conclusion of clinical trials.

Shares outstanding of 109.8 mm, total debt of 51.8 mm, and total cash of 84.7mm were used to convert from enterprise value to equity value. The current implied upside was calculated using the current price of $9.46.

*Wound Care Valuation*

MDXG‚Äôs FY 2021 sales guidance assumed $255 mm to $270 mm in revenue from the wound care segment. Different points in this revenue ranged were used for the low, base, and high cases of the valuation. An EV/Revenue multiple was used to calculate implied enterprise value. The comparables analysis shown in figure 2 illustrated the median multiples derived from the analysis done using the aforementioned list of MDXG‚Äôs competitors. A median multiple of 5.3x was used. The median was used and not marked down because the gross margin and UFCF yield of MDXG is in-line with all competitors. Though the EBIDTA multiple was lower, the similar yield and gross margins indicate that company performance is relatively the same. In addition, litigation expenses factored into the lower EBIDTA multiples and thus it is not indicative of recurring performance.

Based on the revenue multiples, implied share values for the wound care segment range between $12.0 and $12.8.

**Wound Care Equity Value**

**Biopharma Valuation**

Prescience Point estimated annual revenues from Amniofix through using the market capture method. The total market size (annual knee OA injections) was estimated, and a capture percentage was applied to determine the annual number of patients receiving the Amniofix injection. Prescience assumed 1.5 injections per year but to be more conservative in this valuation 1 was used. Price per injection and FDA approval probability varied by the cases and were used to adjust the EV/Rev multiple downwards. Overall, an implied share value range between $25.4 and $57.1 was calculated for this segment.

https://preview.redd.it/we0pw4jm1a071.png?width=611&format=png&auto=webp&s=567d19cc5acc59acbe552a2afcf09789c80866ff

**Biopharma Equity Value**

Overall, the total implied share price ranges between $37.43 to $69.81. As more information regarding Amniofix comes out including the price of manufacturing, different multiples can be used to fine-tune the analysis.

https://preview.redd.it/a8035yfo1a071.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=12e0f9a041e326b505bfda25304261367c651406

**Risks**

1. Given the high influence EW healthcare has on the board of directors, there is potential for more value to describe acquisitions such as that of stability biologics, which was bought for 10 million and sold for 3.5 million 3 years later. If such a trend continues, the value of MDXG‚Äôs wound care business can dramatically decrease, which will hurt the share pierce
2. The FDA approval of Amniofix is a large driver of the valuation calculated. There is a large risk that the FDA will not approve the treatment, however, with the RMAT designation in place and positive results from the first two phases of clinical trials, the odds are strongly in the favour of the approval at the current point in time.

Overall MDXG has been strongly misrepresented by management leading to a skewed opinion and pricing by the market.",nh08j4,$MDXG - Management Miscommunication Skews Valuation Down and Creates Great Buying Opportunity

For those who don't know, $EEM - or the iShares Emerging Markets ETF - is comprised of stocks from developing nations, with a **ton** of room to grow. These countries **will** all catch up soon, it's only a matter of time. This is one of the many reasons I find this setup especially interesting.

Here are the top holdings:

[$EEM Holdings \(By Country\)](https://preview.redd.it/zh7nwb2hfa071.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cb2749a2c7d6c7f548ad89a3f9a746b56d2273)

Next, let's dig into the charts -

Chart 1: **Max Monthly (\~16 Years)**

[$EEM Max Monthly](https://preview.redd.it/ylknrqzhea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=91ee9718b89c47744e6f68224a133c48c7bcfc6f)

Here you can see we have a **symmetrical triangle** pattern that dates back to late 2007. In technical analysis, the longer the pattern has been building, the more significant the breakout will be. Subsequently - you can imagine the magnitude a pattern like this has.

When making new all time highs I like to look for psychological resistances. As a result - logical targets for this pattern are **75.00, 100.00.** Sounds simple, but it works in practice. Keep in mind - something like this will take **3 - 5 years** to play out. This is a position trade.

In order for this breakout to stay valid - we need to continue getting monthly closes above **50.85.** You can see we've pretty much gone perfectly sideways since breaking out for **4 months** now.

This is **bullish -** moving sideways in a higher range is always biased to the upside (except in special situations with certain reversal patterns). Not only that, but we've been forming an interesting setup on the next chart I will show you all -

Chart 2: **1 Year 1 Day**

[$EEM 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/7hy7wbqeea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8102c5b1f0e92c02260cfccc6b8d77eafea8035d)

On this chart - you can make much more sense of those 4 months of sideways. We are actually working on a large **falling wedge** \- which is a bullish continuation pattern. The breakout point for this is sitting around **54.37** as I am writing this (5/20/2021).

Upon breaking this (ignoring the previous chart) - we would target **54.94, 56.49, 57.32, 60.00, 65.00.** That would be if there was no setup on the monthly chart. Each of these are resistances we could stop and consolidate at. I like to scale in after breaking each resistance. Scale into winners and cut losers fast. A break from a pattern like this would probably take **3 - 6 months** to play out.

I also want to note that **MASSIVE** increase in volume on 3/26. Generally - an uptick on volume when price is doing what you want it to is always a plus. But one like that is very intriguing - on a huge green candle too. My guess would be someone loaded their bags there (or a group of players).

\- Research coming out of John Hopkins University is suggesting that the use of Psilocybin is the most effective drug ever tested as a remedy for depression, anxiety, and PTSD. As the United States is currently under crisis in its battle against mental illness, these results are too impressive to ignore, even if it may need to overcome pressures from big pharma interest groups that seek to quell the expansion of this research.

\- These drugs have been extremely effective in treating addiction -- particularly alcohol and nicotine. Considering the government expenditure on the opioid crisis, once this proves to be an effective treatment, the government will expedite the medicinal legalization of the substances that MNMD has been treating/experimenting with.

\- Veterans, the most respected occupational category (statistically,) have begun launching advocacy groups for the widespread medicinal legalization of these substances due to their effectiveness against PTSD. These therapeutic measures have contributed to the plummeting of suicide rates (those treated w/ psilocybin vs. control group.) The Biden administration will have to choose ethics and reason over the suffering of veterans (former government employees) which I anticipate that they will given mounting pressure due to the effectiveness of these treatments.

Does this hinge on expected earnings in the long-run ... certainly!

&#x200B;

But the effectiveness of this research is undeniable and can no longer be overlooked ... because of new cultural acceptance of these alternative treatments the government's hand will be forced in legalize, or otherwise be responsible for mental illness and addiction -- all of which could be treated and cured.

If you aren't familiar with the efficient frontier, what it tries to find is the *mean-variance portfolio.* This type of model deals with portfolio management / optimization. In terms of the efficient frontier you are trying to find the best portfolio allocation weights that give you the best risk adjusted returns. 

**In simple words:** you give it stocks and it tells you the best percentage holdings

I recently built an app on some python code that does this sort of optimization. There is no programming required to use the app. When running the app it will give two portfolios, minimum variance, and maximized sharpe (same as mean-variance, mean-markowitz). Minimum variance will tell you the least riskiest holding strategy (green), and max sharpe will give you the best reward-for-risk holding (red). I call that portfolio *the-juice-is-worth-the-squeeze.* Here is a sample output.

I used around 100,000 simulations, and 10Y of adjusted close data. 

The reason why I bring this up is because it does two things. The first is that it promotes portfolio diversification, which I know is pretty uncommon here. Also it finds the most aggressive returns in terms of minimizing risk. If you have high returns and wonder why you returns are so much higher than standard investment funds its probably because you are here

#Topics of discussion:

* Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks

* WDC Fundamentals

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community.

A little bit about myself for context:

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/555339dhob071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42585b1cfe4cf1c85eab62b0cc01791f5321f1e2

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",nh8f2j,PUBM DD #1

623,,2021-05-20 19:09:28,t3_nh8q8x,,wallstreetbets," So this is the first time I've ever played around with options and I'm probably doing it in a dumb way but get that's more fun for you guys to watch. I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

This is not financial advice but...

Now that Tellurian (TELL) has crossed the 1bln market cap, you are ready to find out about what has the potential to be your biggest play this year.

Tellurian is a stock that‚Äôs been rattled by short sellers, whom the chairman Charif Souki despises and he‚Äôs been pretty vocal about it. The stock price tumbled 60% as a result of aggressive shorting since February and it appeared that the company isn‚Äôt going anywhere. 

However, they have recently repaid most of their debt and are about to start construction of their Driftwood LNG project this summer. They are said to be announcing commercial agreements over the next few weeks which is where the best part comes in‚Ä¶

If you have a browse through the options chain (https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tell/option-chain) you will notice the ridiculous open interest on Jan 22 calls with a strike price of‚Ä¶ 15usd!

It appears that insiders know that big volume contracts are coming and are betting on huge moves with the stock price coming back to its former glory. 

Combined with a significant short volume this has the potential to be a very explosive stock over the coming months.

Position: 9750 shares at 2.44usd

What really, truly bothers me is that most meme stocks, even *squeeze meme* stocks, have a bullish case to be made. Not all are likely, but many are feasible.

They have either eliminated debt, or are in line for a huge contract, or have a recovery plan to help them shed COVID inertia.

But AMC doesn't. It's propped up by a bunch of Occupy Wall Street wannabes who want to eat the rich.

AFTER their board sold even more shares to give themselves over $8 million in bonuses for ""extraordinary efforts"" during the pandemic... this company still trades higher than almost ever, with more shares than ever, and their CEO will make another offering as soon as he thinks the company's image can take it.

Now Partnership With Amazon is positive but nothing is likely to come out from this... It's like  Samsung and LG try to corner the TV with their own OS... nothing after so many years. In this case, its even tougher cos neither BB nor Amazon has any car, and I don't think the big players wanna be part of their ecosystem ...

Puts were net added at strikes below that level (rolled down), however in the money puts have a higher delta. So when those are closed out dealers may have a decent amount of short futures to cover.

saved plenty of it, but as you said, all that is some big information around, but its links with GME share price ever going up is dubious to say the least. GME saga can both be over and it can also have exposed the truth. Just because it exposed the truth doesn't mean there is any squeeze left in the damn thing.

ive done psychedelics since high school, almost every kind including research chemicals and studied the neurological / pharmaceutical effects, ive had maybe 100 trips, and agree that they could help, but long term they ultimately didn't do shit for me. mostly the day after or weeks after, then all good things faded and reality set back in.  
IMO anxiety and depression are a very touchy issue as it is very natural to the human condition.. and measuring it isnt easy as some people just have low tolerance to discomfort especially in this modern age of snow flakes, but life isnt always a comfortable thing...  
its really easy to say they are a revolution and make you feel good, WHEN YOURE HIGH ON THEM. they dont 'cure' anything IMO and are purely a novelty that could definitely aid with PTSD and therapy.

No, it's used as the main contact point for computer parts, the entire socket interface of a CPU is either made of pure gold or electrum alloy that uses gold to prevent corrosion. The demand for gold will go up as the world becomes more reliant on computers. The counter argument against this of course is that it needs very little gold to ensure reliability so the demand is still low and cheap labor in india and china ensures that it is cheap to recycle computer parts for their gold/silver/copper making it a competitive source of reclamation vs mining new gold outright.

We can also argue that when the monetary system does collapse, gold will maintain it's value through the next system since demand will still be there assuming that our society further ""cyberizes"" in the new technological age (because gold/silver/copper is needed in technology). You can argue that silver can be used as a replacement for gold in many interface components since it does perform much better however silver does corrode where as gold does not and remains stable as long as it does not get exposed to amalgam agents like Gallium or Mercury so in solutions that require stable performance, gold cannot be replaced.",,

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

But this stuff interests me and I literally talked my mom into cashing out her ira two days before the markets went down 30% in March. I then told her to buy gold, btw, which she would have made 20% on since then if she actually thought I knew anything.

I thought the same thing in 2006 and I‚Äôll tell you why. My cousin got a huge loan for a house when her and her husband didn‚Äôt make all that much money. I thought that was weird and kinda crazy.

In 2000, I was taking an excel class in school where one of our projects was to pretend we had 10000 in the stock market. In two weeks, I made like 20% on these stupid internet stocks. I, knowing enough to know that I literally was just picking random stocks with no knowledge of anything whatsoever, thought that was weird too and asked my fellow classmate what to do if you think there‚Äôs going to be a crash.

I‚Äôm no Warren Buffett, but I think I can just sense this crap for some reason. At least the crashes. I couldn‚Äôt tell you what to buy in between the crashes, but I‚Äôve sensed the three in my life.

I personally just feel we‚Äôre due for one and when it happens, the Fed won‚Äôt have as many tools to fix it after creating 5 trillion $ in the last year and having interest rates already at zero. What are they going to do? Create 5 trillion more and have negative interest rates on top of it?",,

We had Congress investigating whether DFV had done anything wrong.  That's really all you need to know about where their head is at.   Naked Shorting scam has been glossed over with the ridiculous REG SHO that has no teeth in as far as penalties.  Brokerage firms that are in violation pay the equivalent of good lunch for two people at Del Frisco's Double Eagle.   

The game is rigged and Congress is getting paid handsomely by the guys on K Street not worry about it.  There are no lobbyists for apes, autists and us regular guys.

What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either.

2060,,2021-05-19 20:14:45,t3_ngftx1,,wallstreetbets,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",ngftx1,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Mr. Cramer..."

Big tech's earnings absolutely destroyed estimates but sell side thinks it's due to lock down and people will rely on tech less once things open up. It's a consistent pattern that all the gains made after earning erode overnight or in a few trading session as if the good earning did not happen.

2063,,2021-05-19 20:51:00,t3_nggpql,,wallstreetbets,"I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

2065,,2021-05-19 21:25:26,t3_nghmhm,,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",nghmhm,$NUE is strong as steel. Buy the dips.

Petco earnings is tomorrow pre-market. But this also might be a potential candidate for a short squeeze.

Short sellers are gearing up for a bad quarter. For the last three days, the short float increased from 4 point-something Monday, 6.05 yesterday, and today it's at 8.75.

In addition, short interest is up to 35.2%

To top it off, there are hardly any shares available to short, though borrowing rate remains at only 1%. For the last five days there were no more than 100k shares left to short.

The average price target is $28, but if earnings goes better than expected, this could be the catalyst for something significantly bigger. Listen to your pets' beckoning calls, and keep this on your watch list!

The stock is up 64% since the close on 5/13, through 5/19. Closing volume has ramped up steadily over the same period from 6.3m to 42.4m

Two major catalysts are on the near horizon:

1) Earnings report on 5/24 AH: Confirmation of late Q3 production and disclosure of binding orders have a high probability of being announced.

2) Lordstown Week (June 21-25): Plant open house for tours, test drives, etc., and above all else, transparency.  This should alone should put the final nail in the shorts coffin.

It's still not too late to jump on the $RIDE train and ***squeeze*** the life out of the naysayers. All aboard!

We‚Äôve had a run up of 55% from 5/6-5/17 to $14.38 high on 5/17.  Slight gain of 0.6% on 5/18 (similar to the slight drop on 3/19 with freaky similar volume changes) and then the massive sell off decline on 5/19 of (9.9%) is eerily similar to the (10.3%) drop on 3/22.......

Potential to give up all of the gains since 5/6 by this Friday and puts are ridiculously cheap in the $10 below range for 5/21 and 5/28.  If AMC goes on a similar slide to the March slide, there will be massive returns on these ridiculously cheap put options (9.9% decline today and the sub $10 puts barely moved in price on both the 5/21 and 5/28 expiration dates.

Cheap way to place a bet if the squeeze doesn‚Äôt materialize that could be a >10x return based on how cheap the <$10 puts are for 5/21 and 5/28 put options.

If you are holding stock, max gains you are getting for $20 is ~2x but this could be the real money maker with puts sub $10 priced at $0.01-$0.05 that could go to $0.5+ if the stock slides similar to the March slide.

There are 2 more catalysts on the horizon:

1. Earnings - Monday 5/24: could always be a rug pull... or the next leg up. Fisker moved upward after their earnings, as investors got excited by the Foxconn partnership amongst other things and understood their too young of a company to have substantial figures. RIDE's coming earnings gives them to speak on some hard numbers. ""Soft,"" speculative numbers are what they've been investigated for previously so this will shed some light, as well as any speak on any progress and projects they are working on. 
2. Lordstown Week - June 21-25: This is a full week event at their plant in Ohio. The guts of the operations will be open to the media and investors alike. the first 3 days will have media coverage. The event will include factory tours, presentations and test drives of the Endurance.

2077,,2021-05-20 05:24:49,t3_ngrqqf,,wallstreetbets,"Some context: Cell carriers in the US have decided to stop the function of shared short codes (5-6 digit phone numbers) June 1. Shared short codes were the preferred means of SMS and MMS communication for B2C traffic. Short codes were free to lease in many cases, text messages were cheap, thousands of businesses could send from the same number, and throughput was incredibly high (lots of messages could be sent very fast).

The new policy enforced by the CTIA (The private club all major cell phone carriers are in) is that shared short codes are to be discontinued and replaced by dedicated short codes and A2P 10dlc (approved B2C traffic on 10-digit phone numbers). This means that every business/organization that wants to send texts must either apply for a dedicated short code or apply for a 10DLC. 

Dedicated short codes are the preferred choice for large corporations. They can handle large throughput and look good for the brand. However, they only cater to large corporations because they are thousands of dollars/year to lease. Turn around time for application is 4-6 weeks. Barrier to entry is high.

10DLC is the preferred choice for the smaller businesses since it's less expensive. But, it is still far more expensive than the shared short codes businesses are used to, requires application, and costs $50/mo in carrier and registration fees alone. Turn around time for application is less than a week. On top of fees, 10dlc isn't even fully ready. The Campaign Registry, the organization responsible for rolling out ""the new messaging standard"" for the CTIA, is still developing their API.

Enter Toll-free messaging. TF has 0 barrier to entry and can be issued to a business with SMS and MMS capabilities in seconds. It's the easiest and now the most cost-effective way to send commercial messages.

Conveniently, every major carrier announced this month (for the first time) that they will start collecting a $0.0025/message fee for every sms sent. They're ready for and expecting businesses to move to this method.

Who is Zipwhip: Zipwhip was given full reign over all TF traffic. Anyone in the US  that wants to send messages on TF codes uses Zipwhip in one way or another. They are a massive reseller that everyone is required to go through.

It was recently announced the Twilio plans on acquiring Zipwhip for $850M. Twilio is the leader is programmable messaging hands down. 

Honestly, there should be antitrust issues that arise and block the acquisition. If it goes through, Twilio owns the new world of business sms. Good chance regulators won't notice any issue. They'll miss the fact that businesses will be pressured into TF over their preferred solutions (dedicated short codes and A2P 10DLC) since it's unnecessarily complicated and expensive. TF is ready now and cheap.

TL;DR if Twilio successfully acquires Zipwhip, every small to medium sized business that wants to send texts will have to go through them. Every single one of them in the US.",ngrqqf,$TWLO stands to be the primary source for commercial text messaging

2080,,2021-05-20 08:25:07,t3_ngulnq,,wallstreetbets,"So just how big is **today's news about the initial success of the Sofusa technology**?

1st, this is a technology that aims at lymphatic delivery. 

**What does this mean?** Well, when trying to fight a disease, it's difficult to target the lymphatic system. Because of how it works and the fact that it is spread throughout our body. 

So there are MANY, MANY drugs out there that treat several conditions through the lymphatic system. But, because of what we just explained, those drugs sometimes don't work. They are not properly ""delivered"". They don't get to where they need to get to make the necessary interaction and solve the problem.

**Sorrento has developed a technology that can deliver drugs to where they actually need to go** in the lymphatic system. So this is definitely breakthrough technology. Other companies are aiming to find similar solutions. But we are definitely talking about very advanced bio-tech.

In this case, we have a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. This is a condition that worsens with time. It's very painful and limits the patient's movement. It's not very common, so we are talking about 1.5 million people in the USA and about 30 million worldwide. 

But remember, **the technology Sorrento is developing  will be able to deliver drugs treating many other diseases** related to the lymphatic system. So the market for Sofusa is very, very large.

The press release tells us Sofusa was tested on ""First Enbrel-Non-Responding"" patients. 

**What does this mean?** Patients who need the drug Enbrel and, even though they have not been taking the drug for long (it's a ""first"" for them) they are not responding to it. It isn't helping them. 

Now, Sofusa comes into play. It's job is to deliver Enbrel to the patient effectively. To ""take"" Enbrel to where it needs to go in the lymphatic system.. 

The 1st obvious advantage is that the drug wasn't helping and now helps. But there are other important advantages.

Since the drug is being carried to its targeted ""destination"" the dosage needed, diminishes. Because less is ""lost along the way"". This is important because many diseases related to the lymphatic system, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are chronic, lifelong conditions. Being able to administer less drugs really helps the patient. Now you have a drug that actually works, more potently, which reduces its dosage. All this thanks to Sorrento.

The press release points out an important factor: This is a trial on ONE type of drug/treatment. Other such trials testing the effectiveness of Sofusa are already taking place. Again, this is proof of the potentially huge market for this delivery system.

Just to get an idea, the release mentions anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. These are a type of drugs that inhibit the activity of certain proteins (they inhibit PD1 and CTLA4, which are types of proteins. By stopping their activity, they help in stopping the growth of cancer tumors). There are several drugs that fall under these categories and treat a wide variety of cancers. **Sofusa can potentially play a vital role in all these treatments**. 

This is like several companies developing apps while Sorrento is developing a new smartphone technology. Each app has its rightful use and market. But once the new smartphone is up and working, all apps will need it. So this technology has huge revenue implications. T**he fact we are hearing good news about it is HUGE**.

As for the results themselves: **The DAS28 test measures rheumatoid activity in 28 joints** in the patient's body. The joints might be swollen or tender (hurting).

This patient had a DAS28 score of 4.6, with 18 out of 28 joints compromised.  That is considered  moderate to high disease activity.  There are 4 levels of DAS 28 scores going from remission (the best) to high (the worst). So this patient was not in the worst shape going in, but pretty bad.

Using Sofusa to deliver the Enbrel drug, in just 4 weeks (this is a very short time for this type of disease!!) the results went from 4.6 to 3.0. The total amount of compromised joints, from 18 to 11. **That is a dramatic change**. The patient went from being somewhere between level 3 and 4, to being in the lower level 2, called ""low disease activity"", which indicates it's moving towards remission (the lowest level). For someone suffering from this condition, it's a real life changer. For the company selling Enbrel, it's a real market changer. And if it can equally help people with tumors, **Sofusa becomes a major therapeutic factor.** 

I hope investors understand this. **It's another major development in an already extremely promising pipeline** which is currently badly undervalued. If the price doesn't spike today by 10-15%, as it should, just from this news, it would be disappointing. 

But if you are long, today's price change isn't what matters the most. It‚Äôs the understanding that Sorrento / SRNE has ANOTHER ace in its hand!",ngulnq,How Big is SRNE news release about Sofusa success?

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC and its +23% run in the past week. A stock with a massive dividend. A stock trading with a very low P/E of and income growth of 4,200%.

So why is this stock still a buy and hold for me right now?

The CEO is positioning them to increase shareholder value, but also position the company to weather any reduction in the refi market. (65% of the business)

There are major catalysts that have been driving the increase in price that goes beyond the attention gained on WSB.

* Announced **NET earnings of $860M in the first quarter,** with huge margins.
* Reaffirmed a continued dividend, the next ex-dividend date is **6/9/2021**.
* Announced a **$300M stock buyback, representing as much as 40% of the free float** at the current prices.
* Russell index inclusion was missed last quarter due to confusion about their PREVIOUS status as a SPAC. It is expected that they will be reconsidered for Russell Index inclusions in the yearly reconstitution. While not the biggest catalyst, this is a sign of reputation and long-term stability for the stock. **The prelim list publishes 6/4/2021.**
* Creation of a jumbo mortgage product. The average loan origination in the market is \~410,000, indicating that the non-conforming section of the mortgage market is *exploding.* This is a very profitable sector of loan origination.

Other fundamentals driving a buy recommendation:

* Small float. 90M float, of which only about 60M is freely trading.
* This stock is not persistently pressured down quite as hard as others due to low share availability, but it appears based on the last two weeks it's trading the small waves of this stock to try to push it down under dangerous strike prices. A wave of positive sentiment could strangle this position in the stock. I don't have a Bloomberg terminal, but based on the evidence over the last several days, the indication is the 13.1% SI has grown.
* Exceptional open option interest for **tomorrow 5/21/2021.** The options expiring tomorrow have been documented elsewhere so I won't belabor them, but the open interest at the $9, and $10 strike represent almost 10% of the free float.
* Not a new startup, **they have been in this business since 1986**, making them almost as old as a fossil like me. They clearly survived the 2008 storm. This company isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

The cherry:

* **STILL forecasting growth in Q2**, whereas many of its competitors are not.

This post is NOT financial advice, but as someone who has ridden the waves of this stock since it was about $9, I see this position turning positive and the outlook through July for this position has high sentiment. Even if the mortgage market slows down as expected, I will hold these shares for years to come for the dividends and general stability of the organization.

My position 8000 shares @ 7.65 and 45x 6/18 8c. You can go stalk the fuck out of me if you want to see that I've been talking about this stock for some time and been saying the same thing about the strength and targets of their position since March. I am also the guy that tells you when you unintentionally reveal personal info on your yolo screenshots!

TLDR: UWMC should garner close attention for value investors looking for undervalued positions.

2091,,2021-05-20 13:28:43,t3_nh08j4,,wallstreetbets,"**Investment Thesis**

Overall, what makes MDXG a good buying opportunity right now is a combination of two factors.

* Number one is management‚Äôs miscommunication with the market. The market currently believes that wound care is the core business of MDXG, is not entirely aware of the potential of its biopharma pipeline and more specifically its Amniofix drug, and has priced the company based on this.¬†
* Number two is the huge potential of the Amniofix treatment and its ability to become the next blockbuster in the healthcare space after the conclusion of its phase 3 trial.

**Idea Summary**

MiMedx Group *(MDXG)* is a leading BioPharma and wound care business whose value has been drastically misunderstood by the market. Through drivers such as miscommunication from management about the company‚Äôs valued proposition as well as the lack of institutional investor coverage, the market currently believes that the majority of the company‚Äôs value sits in its low growth wound care business. In reality, its major competitive advantage is within its osteoarthritis drug Amniofix which has the potential to become the next blockbuster after it clears phase III clinical trials. A sum of the parts valuation was used to determine a minimum implied upside of at least 300%. Risks are discussed at the end.

**Business Overview**

MiMedx Group is a leading biopharma and advanced wound care business utilizing human placental tissues to develop products used in the healthcare sector. It processes placental tissues using its patented processes to produce allografts, which are tissues transplanted from one person to another for wound care and regeneration. These allografts are effective in healing difficult wounds because of the ability of the allograft cells to quickly associate with the cells of the patient, thereby taking part in the healing process, easing the ability of the body to close the wound, and speeding up the body‚Äôs regeneration process.

MDXG‚Äôs product offerings can be split into two business segments: wound care and biopharma (surgical solutions). Its flagship product Epifix and additional product Epicord fall under its wound care umbrella, and its flagship product Amniofix as well as additional products Amniocord, Amniofill, and Epiburn fall under its biopharma umbrella. The wound care products service the broad wound care industry, targeting specifically chronic wounds. The biopharma product line is more specific, with the flagship treatment Amniofix targeting knee osteoarthritis in specific.¬†

MDXG sells through direct sales, sales agents, and distributors in the United States. This past quarter, 95% of its sales were direct to customers such as healthcare professionals and facilities.¬†

**Internal Analysis**

The past 3 years have not been ideal for MDXG. Its revenues began to dip in 2018 around the time of their accounting scandal, the growth went from 40% in 2018, to 11% in 2019, and is currently around -16%. This sent their stock price tumbling from $16 USD to lows of almost $1 USD, though it is currently trading at $9 with new updates on their biopharma pipeline.

Their gross margin has stayed very high, around 80% while their EBITDA margins have dropped over the years. Though it wasn‚Äôt explicitly disclosed, a large part of this drop in EBITDA margins has been attributed to a temporary increase in legal fees due to the litigation MDXG has faced this past year. Its decreased volume may have also suppressed margins as the number of wound care treatments in hospitals significantly dropped during COVID-19.¬†

The company‚Äôs cash balance is sitting at a very high level of 84 mm. This is in large part due to its recent capital raise, which happened to be strongly criticized by one of MDXG‚Äôs activist investors, Prescience Point Capital (discussed in detail later).

**External Analysis**

*Wound Care Market*

The global wound care market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% from 2021 to 2028. This has been driven by the aging population and rising rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Wound care products are increasingly being used to prevent and surgical site infections.¬†

Though the overall market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% the specific advanced product segment which includes products such as those of MDXG‚Äôs which target chronic and non-healing wounds, is projected to grow much faster than 4.1%.¬†

The wound care market is relatively fragmented, with large players such as Integra LifeSciences, 3M, Johnson & Johnson, and Medtronic competing to gain the most market share. MDXG‚Äôs direct competition for its allograft advanced wound care treatments include Organogenesis, Axogen, Mediwound, and Vericel.¬†

Organogenesis is currently in the lead in this niche market, and while MDXG reported an 11% YoY decline in sales in 2020 (which has already been factored into the current price), Organogenesis reported a 30% increase. This is evident when comparing the stock performance of both companies over the past year (figure 1)

*Osteoarthritis Therapy Market*

91 million U.S. adults have arthritis, 20M have knee OA, and \~32 million per year are currently treated for plantar fasciitis, which is specifically targeted by MDXG‚Äôs Amniofix drug. There are very few FDA approved treatments for knee OA and plantar fasciitis, and those that exist have low efficacy and many drawbacks. Amniofix is currently the only treatment of its nature in phase 3 clinical trials that have posted very positive results in both company and independent trials, has been used off-label by >100K patients with zero severe adverse effects, and consistently demonstrates a significant reduction in pain as reported by patients. In addition, Amniofix has an RMAT (regenerative medicine advanced therapy) designation granted by the FDA which allows for MDXG to benefit from an expedited approval process from the FDA.

*Management Miscommunication*

The current market opinion of MDXG has been blurred by the miscommunication from company management whose goals do not align with maximizing shareholder value. This is largely due to the fact that EW healthcare, a private equity firm, has 33% representation on the board as a result of its 17% stake. From a corporate finance perspective, a private equity firm‚Äôs interests do not generally tend to align with those of public shareholders. Their influence has been exacerbated by the fact that there are no large institutional holdings in MDXG as of yet other than Prescience Point, and there has been minimal coverage on the stock leading to the market‚Äôs opinion on the company being heavily skewed by management communications.¬†

MDXG‚Äôs current growth strategy is focused on roll-ups in the wound care space. This is very characteristic of a private equity playbook, and goes alongside EW‚Äôs historical acquisitions. As was mentioned in the external analysis, the wound care space is growing at a slow rate of \~4.1%, however MDXG has lost significant market share to Organogenesis. Management has failed to realize that the current value driver of the business is within its biopharma line and not its wound care line, yet has continually communicated to shareholders that it believes it is in fact wound care and it is going to continue investing in growing within the industry.

Prescience Point Capital, an activist investor group which has advocated for change in MDXG's communication strategy, has supported the fact that MDXG‚Äôs communications have been focused on the wrong industry. At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, the potential for the drug Amniofix was drastically undersold and much time was spent convincing investors that the core business is in wound care. The 3.6% decline in shares two days after the conference illustrates how effective this strategy was.¬†

There has been strong opposition from MDXG‚Äôs board of directors to Prescience Point‚Äôs activist efforts. In a shareholder letter in early May, prior to their annual meeting, the company communicated that they believe the wound care and regenerative medicine direction being followed now is ideal. They stated that the activist investor does not understand pharmaceutical company disclosure and were advocating for speculative actions themselves though Prescience‚Äôs report discusses the opposite, with them outlining how EW‚Äôs influence on the board of directors is shifting the company‚Äôs focus away from maximizing shareholder value.

*Amniofix*

As mentioned in the external analysis, there is currently no other treatment, either in development or on the market, as effective as Amniofix in treating knee OA and also just as safe. Most recently, at its Q1 earnings call, MDXG CEO shared positive results from the phase IIb prospective trial of the treatment. There was a statistically significant reduction in VAS (visual analog score) for pain and an improvement in the foot function index score. There were also no serious adverse events during this clinical trial. Amniofix is currently in phase III trials, and MDXG believes they are on target to meet all criteria needed to find a biologics license application (BLA) so that the treatment can be introduced to the general public. MDXG is aiming to file their BLA in the first half of 2022, meaning that within a year this blockbuster treatment could be on the market, and given the feedback so far from clinical trials as well as the RMAT designation, it is highly likely.

A Prescience Point market capture analysis estimated that the treatment would bring in $4,050 million of annual sales. This is \~8 times higher than the current sales brought in through wound care. One year ago it would have been prudent to not entirely incorporate this into the share price, however today with clinical trials nearing completion and MDXG‚Äôs new RMAT designation, the likelihood of approval is much higher.

**Valuation**

From a valuation point of view, a quick sum of the parts analysis is the most ideal given the two different business lines of MDXG. A more in-depth DCF can be created once more cost information is provided from MDXG after the conclusion of clinical trials.

Shares outstanding of 109.8 mm, total debt of 51.8 mm, and total cash of 84.7mm were used to convert from enterprise value to equity value. The current implied upside was calculated using the current price of $9.46.

*Wound Care Valuation*

MDXG‚Äôs FY 2021 sales guidance assumed $255 mm to $270 mm in revenue from the wound care segment. Different points in this revenue ranged were used for the low, base, and high cases of the valuation. An EV/Revenue multiple was used to calculate implied enterprise value. The comparables analysis shown in figure 2 illustrated the median multiples derived from the analysis done using the aforementioned list of MDXG‚Äôs competitors. A median multiple of 5.3x was used. The median was used and not marked down because the gross margin and UFCF yield of MDXG is in-line with all competitors. Though the EBIDTA multiple was lower, the similar yield and gross margins indicate that company performance is relatively the same. In addition, litigation expenses factored into the lower EBIDTA multiples and thus it is not indicative of recurring performance.

Based on the revenue multiples, implied share values for the wound care segment range between $12.0 and $12.8.

**Wound Care Equity Value**

**Biopharma Valuation**

Prescience Point estimated annual revenues from Amniofix through using the market capture method. The total market size (annual knee OA injections) was estimated, and a capture percentage was applied to determine the annual number of patients receiving the Amniofix injection. Prescience assumed 1.5 injections per year but to be more conservative in this valuation 1 was used. Price per injection and FDA approval probability varied by the cases and were used to adjust the EV/Rev multiple downwards. Overall, an implied share value range between $25.4 and $57.1 was calculated for this segment.

https://preview.redd.it/we0pw4jm1a071.png?width=611&format=png&auto=webp&s=567d19cc5acc59acbe552a2afcf09789c80866ff

**Biopharma Equity Value**

Overall, the total implied share price ranges between $37.43 to $69.81. As more information regarding Amniofix comes out including the price of manufacturing, different multiples can be used to fine-tune the analysis.

https://preview.redd.it/a8035yfo1a071.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=12e0f9a041e326b505bfda25304261367c651406

**Risks**

1. Given the high influence EW healthcare has on the board of directors, there is potential for more value to describe acquisitions such as that of stability biologics, which was bought for 10 million and sold for 3.5 million 3 years later. If such a trend continues, the value of MDXG‚Äôs wound care business can dramatically decrease, which will hurt the share pierce
2. The FDA approval of Amniofix is a large driver of the valuation calculated. There is a large risk that the FDA will not approve the treatment, however, with the RMAT designation in place and positive results from the first two phases of clinical trials, the odds are strongly in the favour of the approval at the current point in time.

For those who don't know, $EEM - or the iShares Emerging Markets ETF - is comprised of stocks from developing nations, with a **ton** of room to grow. These countries **will** all catch up soon, it's only a matter of time. This is one of the many reasons I find this setup especially interesting.

Here are the top holdings:

[$EEM Holdings \(By Country\)](https://preview.redd.it/zh7nwb2hfa071.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cb2749a2c7d6c7f548ad89a3f9a746b56d2273)

Next, let's dig into the charts -

Chart 1: **Max Monthly (\~16 Years)**

[$EEM Max Monthly](https://preview.redd.it/ylknrqzhea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=91ee9718b89c47744e6f68224a133c48c7bcfc6f)

Here you can see we have a **symmetrical triangle** pattern that dates back to late 2007. In technical analysis, the longer the pattern has been building, the more significant the breakout will be. Subsequently - you can imagine the magnitude a pattern like this has.

When making new all time highs I like to look for psychological resistances. As a result - logical targets for this pattern are **75.00, 100.00.** Sounds simple, but it works in practice. Keep in mind - something like this will take **3 - 5 years** to play out. This is a position trade.

In order for this breakout to stay valid - we need to continue getting monthly closes above **50.85.** You can see we've pretty much gone perfectly sideways since breaking out for **4 months** now.

This is **bullish -** moving sideways in a higher range is always biased to the upside (except in special situations with certain reversal patterns). Not only that, but we've been forming an interesting setup on the next chart I will show you all -

Chart 2: **1 Year 1 Day**

[$EEM 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/7hy7wbqeea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8102c5b1f0e92c02260cfccc6b8d77eafea8035d)

On this chart - you can make much more sense of those 4 months of sideways. We are actually working on a large **falling wedge** \- which is a bullish continuation pattern. The breakout point for this is sitting around **54.37** as I am writing this (5/20/2021).

Upon breaking this (ignoring the previous chart) - we would target **54.94, 56.49, 57.32, 60.00, 65.00.** That would be if there was no setup on the monthly chart. Each of these are resistances we could stop and consolidate at. I like to scale in after breaking each resistance. Scale into winners and cut losers fast. A break from a pattern like this would probably take **3 - 6 months** to play out.

I also want to note that **MASSIVE** increase in volume on 3/26. Generally - an uptick on volume when price is doing what you want it to is always a plus. But one like that is very intriguing - on a huge green candle too. My guess would be someone loaded their bags there (or a group of players).

And... **that's it.** Keep it simple. Those are often the best setups.

***TL;DR -***

$EEM has a big pattern - broke out 4 months ago just chopping sideways waiting for the move to happen.

Price targets **75.00, 100.00**

Stop out below **50.87** monthly close

Timeframe **3-5 years**

It also has a smaller pattern above that one - which breaks out above **54.37** and has a shorter time horizon.

Price targets **60.00, 65.00**

Stop out if we close back inside

Timeframe **3-6 months**

***Positions -***

10% of my long term portfolio is in emerging markets ETFs and,

August **55c @ 0.91** \- Will always roll these back before they get below 60 DTE - Will scale in heavily after the smaller pattern breaks out

\- Research coming out of John Hopkins University is suggesting that the use of Psilocybin is the most effective drug ever tested as a remedy for depression, anxiety, and PTSD. As the United States is currently under crisis in its battle against mental illness, these results are too impressive to ignore, even if it may need to overcome pressures from big pharma interest groups that seek to quell the expansion of this research.

\- These drugs have been extremely effective in treating addiction -- particularly alcohol and nicotine. Considering the government expenditure on the opioid crisis, once this proves to be an effective treatment, the government will expedite the medicinal legalization of the substances that MNMD has been treating/experimenting with.

\- Veterans, the most respected occupational category (statistically,) have begun launching advocacy groups for the widespread medicinal legalization of these substances due to their effectiveness against PTSD. These therapeutic measures have contributed to the plummeting of suicide rates (those treated w/ psilocybin vs. control group.) The Biden administration will have to choose ethics and reason over the suffering of veterans (former government employees) which I anticipate that they will given mounting pressure due to the effectiveness of these treatments.

&#x200B;

Does this hinge on expected earnings in the long-run ... certainly!

&#x200B;

But the effectiveness of this research is undeniable and can no longer be overlooked ... because of new cultural acceptance of these alternative treatments the government's hand will be forced in legalize, or otherwise be responsible for mental illness and addiction -- all of which could be treated and cured.

If you aren't familiar with the efficient frontier, what it tries to find is the *mean-variance portfolio.* This type of model deals with portfolio management / optimization. In terms of the efficient frontier you are trying to find the best portfolio allocation weights that give you the best risk adjusted returns. 

**In simple words:** you give it stocks and it tells you the best percentage holdings

I recently built an app on some python code that does this sort of optimization. There is no programming required to use the app. When running the app it will give two portfolios, minimum variance, and maximized sharpe (same as mean-variance, mean-markowitz). Minimum variance will tell you the least riskiest holding strategy (green), and max sharpe will give you the best reward-for-risk holding (red). I call that portfolio *the-juice-is-worth-the-squeeze.* Here is a sample output.

I used around 100,000 simulations, and 10Y of adjusted close data. 

The reason why I bring this up is because it does two things. The first is that it promotes portfolio diversification, which I know is pretty uncommon here. Also it finds the most aggressive returns in terms of minimizing risk. If you have high returns and wonder why you returns are so much higher than standard investment funds its probably because you are here

How high could it go?

#Topics of discussion:

* Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks

* WDC Fundamentals

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community.

A little bit about myself for context:

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/555339dhob071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42585b1cfe4cf1c85eab62b0cc01791f5321f1e2

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",nh8f2j,PUBM DD #1

I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

This is not financial advice but...

Now that Tellurian (TELL) has crossed the 1bln market cap, you are ready to find out about what has the potential to be your biggest play this year.

Tellurian is a stock that‚Äôs been rattled by short sellers, whom the chairman Charif Souki despises and he‚Äôs been pretty vocal about it. The stock price tumbled 60% as a result of aggressive shorting since February and it appeared that the company isn‚Äôt going anywhere. 

However, they have recently repaid most of their debt and are about to start construction of their Driftwood LNG project this summer. They are said to be announcing commercial agreements over the next few weeks which is where the best part comes in‚Ä¶

If you have a browse through the options chain (https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tell/option-chain) you will notice the ridiculous open interest on Jan 22 calls with a strike price of‚Ä¶ 15usd!

It appears that insiders know that big volume contracts are coming and are betting on huge moves with the stock price coming back to its former glory. 

Combined with a significant short volume this has the potential to be a very explosive stock over the coming months.

Position: 9750 shares at 2.44usd 
[proof](https://ibb.co/NjcRRhw) 

TL;DR; People are betting on a huge move in TELL, you might want to get on board.",nhakjn,TELL - someone‚Äôs betting on a 6x move

In a rudimentary way, you described a synthetic position. The are two varieties; amazingly, long & short. No, they **ARE NOT** the same thing. You create a position without the need for an underlying and, in doing so, you get similar unlimited upside but the downside can be greater if the stock movers against you.  Most importantly, you do it **WITHOUT** the capital requirements of an actual position.

The long is buying ATM calls and selling an equal number of ATM puts of the same underlying stock and expiration date.  The reverse is true for the synthetic short - sell calls, buy puts.

Now, specific to $GME and the Hedgefucks...

A synthetic share is created by marrying ITM calls with a OTM put. How many ""fake"" shares do you need? Buy the calls to cover.  Oops, still need to get neutral.  Write however many puts it takes to do it. The calls are then exercised, creating ""fake"" shares and those are used to satisfy FTDs. The puts act a short pressure and end-up displacing SI.

You should look at $GME's graphs of ITM calls volume vs FTDs. EVERY TIME FTDs start piling up, üí•. When you're done with that, take a gander at Put OI vs SI%. Pay particular attention to January. Where did all the SI go? Yeah, OTM Puts.",,

IMO it‚Äôs disingenuous to deny that the policy isn‚Äôt a de facto ban; at best, it‚Äôs a cruel double standard.

I‚Äôm baffled by your second assertion. Following their infamous pro-Proposition 8 involvement, when lay Mormons responded to Church leadership calls for its passage by contributing tens of millions of dollars to antigay propaganda, and the eventual legalization of gay marriage in 2015, the Church (IIRC) banned children of gay parents from full participation in its rituals unless they effectively cut ties with them.

To be honest, given its long history of aggressively antigay policies and political activism, not to mention high profile suicides and mass apostasies in protest, it takes a lot of chutzpah to claim the Church encourages compassion towards homosexuals.

I know it‚Äôs far from the only homophobic religion, some of which are exponentially more hostile. I also know many Mormons oppose their Church‚Äôs teachings. And as much as I loathe some of those teachings, I find others really admirable; Mormons are a model minority because of them.

2541,gyvgqj9,2021-05-20 21:44:32,t1_gyvgqj9,t1_gyulzug,wallstreetbets,"Following the release of Endgame in April of 2019 hedge funds began increasing short sales on AMC, because the largest worldwide movie event in history just took place so there was no way that they would be able to match that success, it was the peak, in their eyes. (This is why when people say even prepandemic their numbers werent great, because they are citing a price that had already been shorted for a year.)

This short selling was a smart play to scoop up profits riding the price down but started to get excessive to the point that AMC started to become an undervalued company. Here is Adam talking about short sellers playing games with their stock price in November 2019 https://www.cnbc.com/video/2019/11/07/amc-ceo-weve-been-victim-of-short-selling.html

So, short selling is getting a bit excessive despite good overall reports and riding profits from said largest cinematic event in history earlier in the year. Fast forward another 6 months and the pandemic hits.

The pandemic wasn't just a fundamental problem for thr movie going business, it was an opportunity for tunnel visioned greed to take over. Short sellers already deep in the game on AMC saw an opportunity to not only make profit riding the peak down, but to make a lot more money killing off the business. They increased their positions, new players got in the game because it was an obvious play, and they tried to drive the company out of business and pocket 100% of the profits.

AAs share offering kept the theater afloat and retail interest and love for movies came in to give the company a much needed lifeline, not just driving the stock price away from the brink, but regaining it's overall strength, catching short sellers off guard on their safe 100% profit play.

AMC is a good play for a couple reasons. 

First, simply because I, and many others, love going to the movies and do not want that part of our normal lives taken away for no good reason. The revenue that comes out of the theater profit model may need some updating, but I'd like to spend my money to give them time to adapt a new model and become stronger. The stock was also undervalued prepandemic due to short selling, and pent up excitement to get into theaters and watch new blockbuster films could bring revenues back up to Endgame levels when capacity is back to 100% before tapering off again. This is the non-squeeze fundamental reason it's a good play.

Second, the short sellers and financial morality reasons. Throughout the course of the above events more and more information has come to light. Visible market manipulation has unfolded before our eyes. Toxic trading has become a part of the public consciousness and an opportunity to correct some of the drastic wealth gap that actually doubled during the pandemic at the expense of the average person presented itself in the form of squeezing out the short sellers.  It won't fix everything, but the financial freedom of people willing to give back to their communities rather than hoarding more and more wealth by killing off businesses and putting people out of jobs is a good first step.",,

Congratulations, and fuck me, right?

(Not a financial advice)

Starting from the basics. The first step in any technical analysis, should be to identify the current major trend, including both a short term and a longer term scales. Referring back to April 2020, and up to the first half of December 2020, the consolidation of a flat nature (with several expansions) is prevalent - in the price action diapason of $9.5 to 11 dollars as the upper resistance. As 2021 was approaching, during the last days of December, an extensive upward impulse took place, flirting with $14 resistance level. 
From the current perspective, that rapid price movement looks like a conventional bull trap, to get poor animals slaughtered fast and cruel. And the commencing consequently nasty downtrend supports that proposition - starting on the 28th of December and lasting up to the 11th of May. Talking about a week long period, there is a retracement bull-run apparent, still in action.

The bearish four and a half month old trend outlined above should be of a prior interest for us here, because it is the major market setup to play in currently. As for the next step, it‚Äôs a good idea to grope the key downtrend resistance levels, which will both magnet the price action as well as recalcitrating it should the price action come near. The first and the most powerful resistance line should be drawn from the lowest point of Dec 28 daily candle‚Äôs tail, and include the following apexes: on Feb 4 (not touched, but not far); Mar 4; Mar 18; Apr 29 and May 13. Based on how this resistance surpassed the price action, it is appropriate to consider it the most important resistance the bears had in hands. As it had been broken the day before yesterday, it may be viewed as a bullish signal.

With a caution, definitely. Because there is the second most important downtrend resistance overhanging: just connect the December 28th daily candle‚Äôs opening price point with Dec 29, Jan 4 & 11 apexes, and the third of March shot opening price.

Moving further, another important tool worthy to be applied here is Fibonacci retracement (who would have guessed?). The starting point of the downtrend measurement being easily identifiable (28 Dec), and the final price point is not too difficult to find here too (the bottom low of $6.33 on May 11). You should notice, how well Fibo applies here, and how the price action confirms that by playing with these levels and in between those. Recently $8.13 (23.6% Fibo level) was conquered, but there is a significant resistance at $9.24 (38.2% retr.) and another solid one at $10.14 (50%). This price diapason ($9-10) seems to be insurmountable as a resistance zone from the current point of view, coupled with the 150 daily simple MA and the second resistance described in the previous paragraph, all converging in this zone.

Speaking about volume, the increase is evident recently. However, in order for the price action to conquer the resistance zone outlined above, a lot more (and I mean A LOT) buying volume is necessary.

MACD and StochRSI indicate the incipient bullish momentum, rolling up from the bearish zone and both pointing up.

TL;DR: So, buy UWMC? Dunno. Overall, a mixed setup, with additional confirmations necessary in order to enter the trade confidently. The reversal of a four and a half months downtrend is apparent, but the outstanding selling pressure (elaborated above) coming from $9-10 diapason looks scary to me. The best play for now would be sitting out and observing from the distance, with a careful entry as soon as $10 level (and preferably $11) is broken and confirmed as a support afterwards. YMCA looks solid though.

**SPY Results:**

First thing I notice is that periods of high variance returns are not sustained and they look possibly isolated, although there minor spikes before each big one.

https://preview.redd.it/ln6677wul1071.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c72c82557c3045a9575d857189931a84a693c24

On the other hand it looks like medium variance and low variance are in a constant switch off. We can see the almost perfect inversion between low variance probabilities and medium.

https://preview.redd.it/eqnl6ctzl1071.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f75444f4a5a854e7d842bb7f212c378c442f928

Most of those high variance returns come from changes from low to high variance. 

https://preview.redd.it/awjv82x4m1071.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=840a93a87d1745f84d79964cc296b8b282ff4153

This shows that high variance returns are more like *surprises* in the market because they come from low variance returns, its not a gradual buildup.  

**QQQ results**

QQQ‚Äôs results are very similar to SPY‚Äôs results. 

https://preview.redd.it/bqavsxmam1071.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad8be59558f24274d2ac689fa83e8c7a629de55

It seems like there are not *precursor* spikes in high variance returns, and the occur in isolation.  In this case it does seem like there is a sustained period of high variance returns in the early 2000s.  

https://preview.redd.it/gp4sc5yem1071.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=73c238b2a8657a2ada87e458ebc27140654a352f

The same cyclical inverse pattern occurs within the low and medium level regimes.

https://preview.redd.it/qqkq714km1071.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=899816666e35168b5e1756ee58dba86013739f5c

And consistent with SPY it seems like high variance regime spikes come from low variance to high variance.

https://preview.redd.it/cb5o3v2om1071.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89f554112e2b8dd2d79904a6aa6249b3326a31a

**Conclusions / Future areas to investigate**

¬∑ In CBOE VIX data is was common for large spikes in high variance to come from medium variance regimes, that does not seem to be the case for SPY or QQQ most of the high variance spikes come from changes from low variance to high variance

¬∑ Both QQQ and SPY exhibited what look like to be an inverse relationship between low and medium variance regimes. Confirming results and possibly making indicators could be comparing covariances and trends between the time series and then if a there is a *shift* that is probably a *break* in the relationship which probably leads to a time of high variance

¬∑ QQQ did exhibit high variance regime for a longer sustained time and that may be because of its growth-orientation.

 I hope to turn the codebase into a python-only repo so I can analyze the time series in a notebook a publish more of my findings.

Keep in mind - the larger the pattern, the larger the move, **the longer it takes to play out.** This isn't going to happen overnight. Timeframe to complete the move is **3-6 months** \- and we could form lots of smaller patterns in between.

Every time we cross one of those resistances, it should become a support. Also note that upon reaching them, it's likely we consolidate for a few days. Overall - a super clean setup, and a play I've been eyeing since March. 

Lastly, keep in mind - for a setup of this magnitude, you want the **weekly close** for confirmation.

But - what makes this really interesting is the **10 year 1 week chart.**

[$GC 10 Year 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/ejdwc9xvj3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bdfbd8e014548cda17aaf6e754e28cd9abf651f)

Here, we have an absolutely massive cup and handle dating back to 2011. In this context - the addition of this data mainly means we can look for a much higher price target on the wedge breakout. 

As a result - I'm targeting $GC **2250 - 2500** within the next **year.** Remember what I said about timeframes. This could take quite a while. For this setup to trigger - I'm looking for the **monthly close** above that first breakout point.

And... that's it. Remember, technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. Fake outs can and do happen. That's why we identify **key levels** to tell where we are within a setup. Take it step by step.

***TL;DR -*** 

$GC above 1853 weekly close targets **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3**

I'm planning to continue doing weekly relative rotation analysis of the market, but wanted to create this mid week post to take a quick look at UWMC. Please let me know if another flair is more appropriate.

I'm not going to get into the financials, since plenty of solid DD has been done on that already. However, I did mention in my last post (analyzing the market sectors) that I would look into positions related to the real estate sector (XLRE).

My thought process here it to take a look at the short term momentum for this stock due to the recent positive earnings, great financials, positive future outlook, and upcoming June Ex-Div date.

Lets jump into it and make it quick...

Since there is a lot of talk regarding Russell inclusion, here is the RRG of UWMC again UWM:

**My Thoughts:**

Personally, the company has strong fundamentals. So, in combination with the momentum, I think its a decent ""buy"" (this is not professional financial advice).

I'm playing this 3 ways:

6/18 short put x 2 @ $7

7/16 long call x 5 @ $6

1100 shares @ $8.06

Edit 1: Silly me, I forgot to mention that a share buyback plan was approved which also contributes to the positive momentum.

What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either.

Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",ngftx1,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Mr. Cramer..."

2598,,2021-05-19 20:51:00,t3_nggpql,,wallstreetbets,"I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

2600,,2021-05-19 21:25:26,t3_nghmhm,,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",nghmhm,$NUE is strong as steel. Buy the dips.

Petco earnings is tomorrow pre-market. But this also might be a potential candidate for a short squeeze.

Short sellers are gearing up for a bad quarter. For the last three days, the short float increased from 4 point-something Monday, 6.05 yesterday, and today it's at 8.75.

In addition, short interest is up to 35.2%

To top it off, there are hardly any shares available to short, though borrowing rate remains at only 1%. For the last five days there were no more than 100k shares left to short.

The average price target is $28, but if earnings goes better than expected, this could be the catalyst for something significantly bigger. Listen to your pets' beckoning calls, and keep this on your watch list!

2612,,2021-05-20 05:24:49,t3_ngrqqf,,wallstreetbets,"Some context: Cell carriers in the US have decided to stop the function of shared short codes (5-6 digit phone numbers) June 1. Shared short codes were the preferred means of SMS and MMS communication for B2C traffic. Short codes were free to lease in many cases, text messages were cheap, thousands of businesses could send from the same number, and throughput was incredibly high (lots of messages could be sent very fast).

The new policy enforced by the CTIA (The private club all major cell phone carriers are in) is that shared short codes are to be discontinued and replaced by dedicated short codes and A2P 10dlc (approved B2C traffic on 10-digit phone numbers). This means that every business/organization that wants to send texts must either apply for a dedicated short code or apply for a 10DLC. 

Dedicated short codes are the preferred choice for large corporations. They can handle large throughput and look good for the brand. However, they only cater to large corporations because they are thousands of dollars/year to lease. Turn around time for application is 4-6 weeks. Barrier to entry is high.

10DLC is the preferred choice for the smaller businesses since it's less expensive. But, it is still far more expensive than the shared short codes businesses are used to, requires application, and costs $50/mo in carrier and registration fees alone. Turn around time for application is less than a week. On top of fees, 10dlc isn't even fully ready. The Campaign Registry, the organization responsible for rolling out ""the new messaging standard"" for the CTIA, is still developing their API.

Enter Toll-free messaging. TF has 0 barrier to entry and can be issued to a business with SMS and MMS capabilities in seconds. It's the easiest and now the most cost-effective way to send commercial messages.

Conveniently, every major carrier announced this month (for the first time) that they will start collecting a $0.0025/message fee for every sms sent. They're ready for and expecting businesses to move to this method.

Who is Zipwhip: Zipwhip was given full reign over all TF traffic. Anyone in the US  that wants to send messages on TF codes uses Zipwhip in one way or another. They are a massive reseller that everyone is required to go through.

It was recently announced the Twilio plans on acquiring Zipwhip for $850M. Twilio is the leader is programmable messaging hands down. 

Honestly, there should be antitrust issues that arise and block the acquisition. If it goes through, Twilio owns the new world of business sms. Good chance regulators won't notice any issue. They'll miss the fact that businesses will be pressured into TF over their preferred solutions (dedicated short codes and A2P 10DLC) since it's unnecessarily complicated and expensive. TF is ready now and cheap.

TL;DR if Twilio successfully acquires Zipwhip, every small to medium sized business that wants to send texts will have to go through them. Every single one of them in the US.",ngrqqf,$TWLO stands to be the primary source for commercial text messaging

2615,,2021-05-20 08:25:07,t3_ngulnq,,wallstreetbets,"So just how big is **today's news about the initial success of the Sofusa technology**?

1st, this is a technology that aims at lymphatic delivery. 

**What does this mean?** Well, when trying to fight a disease, it's difficult to target the lymphatic system. Because of how it works and the fact that it is spread throughout our body. 

So there are MANY, MANY drugs out there that treat several conditions through the lymphatic system. But, because of what we just explained, those drugs sometimes don't work. They are not properly ""delivered"". They don't get to where they need to get to make the necessary interaction and solve the problem.

**Sorrento has developed a technology that can deliver drugs to where they actually need to go** in the lymphatic system. So this is definitely breakthrough technology. Other companies are aiming to find similar solutions. But we are definitely talking about very advanced bio-tech.

In this case, we have a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. This is a condition that worsens with time. It's very painful and limits the patient's movement. It's not very common, so we are talking about 1.5 million people in the USA and about 30 million worldwide. 

But remember, **the technology Sorrento is developing  will be able to deliver drugs treating many other diseases** related to the lymphatic system. So the market for Sofusa is very, very large.

The press release tells us Sofusa was tested on ""First Enbrel-Non-Responding"" patients. 

**What does this mean?** Patients who need the drug Enbrel and, even though they have not been taking the drug for long (it's a ""first"" for them) they are not responding to it. It isn't helping them. 

Now, Sofusa comes into play. It's job is to deliver Enbrel to the patient effectively. To ""take"" Enbrel to where it needs to go in the lymphatic system.. 

The 1st obvious advantage is that the drug wasn't helping and now helps. But there are other important advantages.

Since the drug is being carried to its targeted ""destination"" the dosage needed, diminishes. Because less is ""lost along the way"". This is important because many diseases related to the lymphatic system, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are chronic, lifelong conditions. Being able to administer less drugs really helps the patient. Now you have a drug that actually works, more potently, which reduces its dosage. All this thanks to Sorrento.

The press release points out an important factor: This is a trial on ONE type of drug/treatment. Other such trials testing the effectiveness of Sofusa are already taking place. Again, this is proof of the potentially huge market for this delivery system.

Just to get an idea, the release mentions anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. These are a type of drugs that inhibit the activity of certain proteins (they inhibit PD1 and CTLA4, which are types of proteins. By stopping their activity, they help in stopping the growth of cancer tumors). There are several drugs that fall under these categories and treat a wide variety of cancers. **Sofusa can potentially play a vital role in all these treatments**. 

This is like several companies developing apps while Sorrento is developing a new smartphone technology. Each app has its rightful use and market. But once the new smartphone is up and working, all apps will need it. So this technology has huge revenue implications. T**he fact we are hearing good news about it is HUGE**.

As for the results themselves: **The DAS28 test measures rheumatoid activity in 28 joints** in the patient's body. The joints might be swollen or tender (hurting).

This patient had a DAS28 score of 4.6, with 18 out of 28 joints compromised.  That is considered  moderate to high disease activity.  There are 4 levels of DAS 28 scores going from remission (the best) to high (the worst). So this patient was not in the worst shape going in, but pretty bad.

Using Sofusa to deliver the Enbrel drug, in just 4 weeks (this is a very short time for this type of disease!!) the results went from 4.6 to 3.0. The total amount of compromised joints, from 18 to 11. **That is a dramatic change**. The patient went from being somewhere between level 3 and 4, to being in the lower level 2, called ""low disease activity"", which indicates it's moving towards remission (the lowest level). For someone suffering from this condition, it's a real life changer. For the company selling Enbrel, it's a real market changer. And if it can equally help people with tumors, **Sofusa becomes a major therapeutic factor.** 

I hope investors understand this. **It's another major development in an already extremely promising pipeline** which is currently badly undervalued. If the price doesn't spike today by 10-15%, as it should, just from this news, it would be disappointing. 

But if you are long, today's price change isn't what matters the most. It‚Äôs the understanding that Sorrento / SRNE has ANOTHER ace in its hand!",ngulnq,How Big is SRNE news release about Sofusa success?

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC and its +23% run in the past week. A stock with a massive dividend. A stock trading with a very low P/E of and income growth of 4,200%.

So why is this stock still a buy and hold for me right now?

The CEO is positioning them to increase shareholder value, but also position the company to weather any reduction in the refi market. (65% of the business)

There are major catalysts that have been driving the increase in price that goes beyond the attention gained on WSB.

* Announced **NET earnings of $860M in the first quarter,** with huge margins.
* Reaffirmed a continued dividend, the next ex-dividend date is **6/9/2021**.
* Announced a **$300M stock buyback, representing as much as 40% of the free float** at the current prices.
* Russell index inclusion was missed last quarter due to confusion about their PREVIOUS status as a SPAC. It is expected that they will be reconsidered for Russell Index inclusions in the yearly reconstitution. While not the biggest catalyst, this is a sign of reputation and long-term stability for the stock. **The prelim list publishes 6/4/2021.**
* Creation of a jumbo mortgage product. The average loan origination in the market is \~410,000, indicating that the non-conforming section of the mortgage market is *exploding.* This is a very profitable sector of loan origination.

Other fundamentals driving a buy recommendation:

* Small float. 90M float, of which only about 60M is freely trading.
* This stock is not persistently pressured down quite as hard as others due to low share availability, but it appears based on the last two weeks it's trading the small waves of this stock to try to push it down under dangerous strike prices. A wave of positive sentiment could strangle this position in the stock. I don't have a Bloomberg terminal, but based on the evidence over the last several days, the indication is the 13.1% SI has grown.
* Exceptional open option interest for **tomorrow 5/21/2021.** The options expiring tomorrow have been documented elsewhere so I won't belabor them, but the open interest at the $9, and $10 strike represent almost 10% of the free float.
* Not a new startup, **they have been in this business since 1986**, making them almost as old as a fossil like me. They clearly survived the 2008 storm. This company isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

The cherry:

* **STILL forecasting growth in Q2**, whereas many of its competitors are not.

This post is NOT financial advice, but as someone who has ridden the waves of this stock since it was about $9, I see this position turning positive and the outlook through July for this position has high sentiment. Even if the mortgage market slows down as expected, I will hold these shares for years to come for the dividends and general stability of the organization.

My position 8000 shares @ 7.65 and 45x 6/18 8c. You can go stalk the fuck out of me if you want to see that I've been talking about this stock for some time and been saying the same thing about the strength and targets of their position since March. I am also the guy that tells you when you unintentionally reveal personal info on your yolo screenshots!

TLDR: UWMC should garner close attention for value investors looking for undervalued positions.

2626,,2021-05-20 13:28:43,t3_nh08j4,,wallstreetbets,"**Investment Thesis**

Overall, what makes MDXG a good buying opportunity right now is a combination of two factors.

* Number one is management‚Äôs miscommunication with the market. The market currently believes that wound care is the core business of MDXG, is not entirely aware of the potential of its biopharma pipeline and more specifically its Amniofix drug, and has priced the company based on this.¬†
* Number two is the huge potential of the Amniofix treatment and its ability to become the next blockbuster in the healthcare space after the conclusion of its phase 3 trial.

**Idea Summary**

MiMedx Group *(MDXG)* is a leading BioPharma and wound care business whose value has been drastically misunderstood by the market. Through drivers such as miscommunication from management about the company‚Äôs valued proposition as well as the lack of institutional investor coverage, the market currently believes that the majority of the company‚Äôs value sits in its low growth wound care business. In reality, its major competitive advantage is within its osteoarthritis drug Amniofix which has the potential to become the next blockbuster after it clears phase III clinical trials. A sum of the parts valuation was used to determine a minimum implied upside of at least 300%. Risks are discussed at the end.

**Business Overview**

MiMedx Group is a leading biopharma and advanced wound care business utilizing human placental tissues to develop products used in the healthcare sector. It processes placental tissues using its patented processes to produce allografts, which are tissues transplanted from one person to another for wound care and regeneration. These allografts are effective in healing difficult wounds because of the ability of the allograft cells to quickly associate with the cells of the patient, thereby taking part in the healing process, easing the ability of the body to close the wound, and speeding up the body‚Äôs regeneration process.

MDXG‚Äôs product offerings can be split into two business segments: wound care and biopharma (surgical solutions). Its flagship product Epifix and additional product Epicord fall under its wound care umbrella, and its flagship product Amniofix as well as additional products Amniocord, Amniofill, and Epiburn fall under its biopharma umbrella. The wound care products service the broad wound care industry, targeting specifically chronic wounds. The biopharma product line is more specific, with the flagship treatment Amniofix targeting knee osteoarthritis in specific.¬†

MDXG sells through direct sales, sales agents, and distributors in the United States. This past quarter, 95% of its sales were direct to customers such as healthcare professionals and facilities.¬†

**Internal Analysis**

The past 3 years have not been ideal for MDXG. Its revenues began to dip in 2018 around the time of their accounting scandal, the growth went from 40% in 2018, to 11% in 2019, and is currently around -16%. This sent their stock price tumbling from $16 USD to lows of almost $1 USD, though it is currently trading at $9 with new updates on their biopharma pipeline.

Their gross margin has stayed very high, around 80% while their EBITDA margins have dropped over the years. Though it wasn‚Äôt explicitly disclosed, a large part of this drop in EBITDA margins has been attributed to a temporary increase in legal fees due to the litigation MDXG has faced this past year. Its decreased volume may have also suppressed margins as the number of wound care treatments in hospitals significantly dropped during COVID-19.¬†

The company‚Äôs cash balance is sitting at a very high level of 84 mm. This is in large part due to its recent capital raise, which happened to be strongly criticized by one of MDXG‚Äôs activist investors, Prescience Point Capital (discussed in detail later).

**External Analysis**

*Wound Care Market*

The global wound care market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% from 2021 to 2028. This has been driven by the aging population and rising rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Wound care products are increasingly being used to prevent and surgical site infections.¬†

Though the overall market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% the specific advanced product segment which includes products such as those of MDXG‚Äôs which target chronic and non-healing wounds, is projected to grow much faster than 4.1%.¬†

The wound care market is relatively fragmented, with large players such as Integra LifeSciences, 3M, Johnson & Johnson, and Medtronic competing to gain the most market share. MDXG‚Äôs direct competition for its allograft advanced wound care treatments include Organogenesis, Axogen, Mediwound, and Vericel.¬†

Organogenesis is currently in the lead in this niche market, and while MDXG reported an 11% YoY decline in sales in 2020 (which has already been factored into the current price), Organogenesis reported a 30% increase. This is evident when comparing the stock performance of both companies over the past year (figure 1)

*Osteoarthritis Therapy Market*

91 million U.S. adults have arthritis, 20M have knee OA, and \~32 million per year are currently treated for plantar fasciitis, which is specifically targeted by MDXG‚Äôs Amniofix drug. There are very few FDA approved treatments for knee OA and plantar fasciitis, and those that exist have low efficacy and many drawbacks. Amniofix is currently the only treatment of its nature in phase 3 clinical trials that have posted very positive results in both company and independent trials, has been used off-label by >100K patients with zero severe adverse effects, and consistently demonstrates a significant reduction in pain as reported by patients. In addition, Amniofix has an RMAT (regenerative medicine advanced therapy) designation granted by the FDA which allows for MDXG to benefit from an expedited approval process from the FDA.

*Management Miscommunication*

The current market opinion of MDXG has been blurred by the miscommunication from company management whose goals do not align with maximizing shareholder value. This is largely due to the fact that EW healthcare, a private equity firm, has 33% representation on the board as a result of its 17% stake. From a corporate finance perspective, a private equity firm‚Äôs interests do not generally tend to align with those of public shareholders. Their influence has been exacerbated by the fact that there are no large institutional holdings in MDXG as of yet other than Prescience Point, and there has been minimal coverage on the stock leading to the market‚Äôs opinion on the company being heavily skewed by management communications.¬†

MDXG‚Äôs current growth strategy is focused on roll-ups in the wound care space. This is very characteristic of a private equity playbook, and goes alongside EW‚Äôs historical acquisitions. As was mentioned in the external analysis, the wound care space is growing at a slow rate of \~4.1%, however MDXG has lost significant market share to Organogenesis. Management has failed to realize that the current value driver of the business is within its biopharma line and not its wound care line, yet has continually communicated to shareholders that it believes it is in fact wound care and it is going to continue investing in growing within the industry.

Prescience Point Capital, an activist investor group which has advocated for change in MDXG's communication strategy, has supported the fact that MDXG‚Äôs communications have been focused on the wrong industry. At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, the potential for the drug Amniofix was drastically undersold and much time was spent convincing investors that the core business is in wound care. The 3.6% decline in shares two days after the conference illustrates how effective this strategy was.¬†

There has been strong opposition from MDXG‚Äôs board of directors to Prescience Point‚Äôs activist efforts. In a shareholder letter in early May, prior to their annual meeting, the company communicated that they believe the wound care and regenerative medicine direction being followed now is ideal. They stated that the activist investor does not understand pharmaceutical company disclosure and were advocating for speculative actions themselves though Prescience‚Äôs report discusses the opposite, with them outlining how EW‚Äôs influence on the board of directors is shifting the company‚Äôs focus away from maximizing shareholder value.

*Amniofix*

As mentioned in the external analysis, there is currently no other treatment, either in development or on the market, as effective as Amniofix in treating knee OA and also just as safe. Most recently, at its Q1 earnings call, MDXG CEO shared positive results from the phase IIb prospective trial of the treatment. There was a statistically significant reduction in VAS (visual analog score) for pain and an improvement in the foot function index score. There were also no serious adverse events during this clinical trial. Amniofix is currently in phase III trials, and MDXG believes they are on target to meet all criteria needed to find a biologics license application (BLA) so that the treatment can be introduced to the general public. MDXG is aiming to file their BLA in the first half of 2022, meaning that within a year this blockbuster treatment could be on the market, and given the feedback so far from clinical trials as well as the RMAT designation, it is highly likely.

A Prescience Point market capture analysis estimated that the treatment would bring in $4,050 million of annual sales. This is \~8 times higher than the current sales brought in through wound care. One year ago it would have been prudent to not entirely incorporate this into the share price, however today with clinical trials nearing completion and MDXG‚Äôs new RMAT designation, the likelihood of approval is much higher.

**Valuation**

From a valuation point of view, a quick sum of the parts analysis is the most ideal given the two different business lines of MDXG. A more in-depth DCF can be created once more cost information is provided from MDXG after the conclusion of clinical trials.

Shares outstanding of 109.8 mm, total debt of 51.8 mm, and total cash of 84.7mm were used to convert from enterprise value to equity value. The current implied upside was calculated using the current price of $9.46.

*Wound Care Valuation*

MDXG‚Äôs FY 2021 sales guidance assumed $255 mm to $270 mm in revenue from the wound care segment. Different points in this revenue ranged were used for the low, base, and high cases of the valuation. An EV/Revenue multiple was used to calculate implied enterprise value. The comparables analysis shown in figure 2 illustrated the median multiples derived from the analysis done using the aforementioned list of MDXG‚Äôs competitors. A median multiple of 5.3x was used. The median was used and not marked down because the gross margin and UFCF yield of MDXG is in-line with all competitors. Though the EBIDTA multiple was lower, the similar yield and gross margins indicate that company performance is relatively the same. In addition, litigation expenses factored into the lower EBIDTA multiples and thus it is not indicative of recurring performance.

Based on the revenue multiples, implied share values for the wound care segment range between $12.0 and $12.8.

**Wound Care Equity Value**

https://preview.redd.it/dibh93jl1a071.png?width=549&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c1871e08591796daa0a434274332cd9a4353258

**Biopharma Valuation**

Prescience Point estimated annual revenues from Amniofix through using the market capture method. The total market size (annual knee OA injections) was estimated, and a capture percentage was applied to determine the annual number of patients receiving the Amniofix injection. Prescience assumed 1.5 injections per year but to be more conservative in this valuation 1 was used. Price per injection and FDA approval probability varied by the cases and were used to adjust the EV/Rev multiple downwards. Overall, an implied share value range between $25.4 and $57.1 was calculated for this segment.

https://preview.redd.it/we0pw4jm1a071.png?width=611&format=png&auto=webp&s=567d19cc5acc59acbe552a2afcf09789c80866ff

**Biopharma Equity Value**

Overall, the total implied share price ranges between $37.43 to $69.81. As more information regarding Amniofix comes out including the price of manufacturing, different multiples can be used to fine-tune the analysis.

https://preview.redd.it/a8035yfo1a071.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=12e0f9a041e326b505bfda25304261367c651406

**Risks**

1. Given the high influence EW healthcare has on the board of directors, there is potential for more value to describe acquisitions such as that of stability biologics, which was bought for 10 million and sold for 3.5 million 3 years later. If such a trend continues, the value of MDXG‚Äôs wound care business can dramatically decrease, which will hurt the share pierce
2. The FDA approval of Amniofix is a large driver of the valuation calculated. There is a large risk that the FDA will not approve the treatment, however, with the RMAT designation in place and positive results from the first two phases of clinical trials, the odds are strongly in the favour of the approval at the current point in time.

Overall MDXG has been strongly misrepresented by management leading to a skewed opinion and pricing by the market.",nh08j4,$MDXG - Management Miscommunication Skews Valuation Down and Creates Great Buying Opportunity

[$EEM Holdings \(By Country\)](https://preview.redd.it/zh7nwb2hfa071.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cb2749a2c7d6c7f548ad89a3f9a746b56d2273)

Next, let's dig into the charts -

Chart 1: **Max Monthly (\~16 Years)**

[$EEM Max Monthly](https://preview.redd.it/ylknrqzhea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=91ee9718b89c47744e6f68224a133c48c7bcfc6f)

Here you can see we have a **symmetrical triangle** pattern that dates back to late 2007. In technical analysis, the longer the pattern has been building, the more significant the breakout will be. Subsequently - you can imagine the magnitude a pattern like this has.

When making new all time highs I like to look for psychological resistances. As a result - logical targets for this pattern are **75.00, 100.00.** Sounds simple, but it works in practice. Keep in mind - something like this will take **3 - 5 years** to play out. This is a position trade.

In order for this breakout to stay valid - we need to continue getting monthly closes above **50.85.** You can see we've pretty much gone perfectly sideways since breaking out for **4 months** now.

This is **bullish -** moving sideways in a higher range is always biased to the upside (except in special situations with certain reversal patterns). Not only that, but we've been forming an interesting setup on the next chart I will show you all -

Chart 2: **1 Year 1 Day**

[$EEM 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/7hy7wbqeea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8102c5b1f0e92c02260cfccc6b8d77eafea8035d)

On this chart - you can make much more sense of those 4 months of sideways. We are actually working on a large **falling wedge** \- which is a bullish continuation pattern. The breakout point for this is sitting around **54.37** as I am writing this (5/20/2021).

Upon breaking this (ignoring the previous chart) - we would target **54.94, 56.49, 57.32, 60.00, 65.00.** That would be if there was no setup on the monthly chart. Each of these are resistances we could stop and consolidate at. I like to scale in after breaking each resistance. Scale into winners and cut losers fast. A break from a pattern like this would probably take **3 - 6 months** to play out.

I also want to note that **MASSIVE** increase in volume on 3/26. Generally - an uptick on volume when price is doing what you want it to is always a plus. But one like that is very intriguing - on a huge green candle too. My guess would be someone loaded their bags there (or a group of players).

And... **that's it.** Keep it simple. Those are often the best setups.

***TL;DR -***

$EEM has a big pattern - broke out 4 months ago just chopping sideways waiting for the move to happen.

Price targets **75.00, 100.00**

Stop out below **50.87** monthly close

Timeframe **3-5 years**

It also has a smaller pattern above that one - which breaks out above **54.37** and has a shorter time horizon.

Price targets **60.00, 65.00**

Stop out if we close back inside

Timeframe **3-6 months**

***Positions -***

Considering the government expenditure on the opioid crisis, once this proves to be an effective treatment, the government will expedite the medicinal legalization of the substances that MNMD has been treating/experimenting with.

\- Veterans, the most respected occupational category (statistically,) have begun launching advocacy groups for the widespread medicinal legalization of these substances due to their effectiveness against PTSD. These therapeutic measures have contributed to the plummeting of suicide rates (those treated w/ psilocybin vs. control group.) The Biden administration will have to choose ethics and reason over the suffering of veterans (former government employees) which I anticipate that they will given mounting pressure due to the effectiveness of these treatments.

If you aren't familiar with the efficient frontier, what it tries to find is the *mean-variance portfolio.* This type of model deals with portfolio management / optimization. In terms of the efficient frontier you are trying to find the best portfolio allocation weights that give you the best risk adjusted returns. 

**In simple words:** you give it stocks and it tells you the best percentage holdings

I recently built an app on some python code that does this sort of optimization. There is no programming required to use the app. When running the app it will give two portfolios, minimum variance, and maximized sharpe (same as mean-variance, mean-markowitz). Minimum variance will tell you the least riskiest holding strategy (green), and max sharpe will give you the best reward-for-risk holding (red). I call that portfolio *the-juice-is-worth-the-squeeze.* Here is a sample output.

I used around 100,000 simulations, and 10Y of adjusted close data. 

The reason why I bring this up is because it does two things. The first is that it promotes portfolio diversification, which I know is pretty uncommon here. Also it finds the most aggressive returns in terms of minimizing risk. If you have high returns and wonder why you returns are so much higher than standard investment funds its probably because you are here

* Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks

* WDC Fundamentals

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

I believe the technology will allow for a more personal approach in the field of medicine, and should not be viewed solely as a research-based company.  

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community.

A little bit about myself for context:

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/555339dhob071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42585b1cfe4cf1c85eab62b0cc01791f5321f1e2

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",nh8f2j,PUBM DD #1

2650,,2021-05-20 19:09:28,t3_nh8q8x,,wallstreetbets," So this is the first time I've ever played around with options and I'm probably doing it in a dumb way but get that's more fun for you guys to watch. I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

Now that Tellurian (TELL) has crossed the 1bln market cap, you are ready to find out about what has the potential to be your biggest play this year.

Tellurian is a stock that‚Äôs been rattled by short sellers, whom the chairman Charif Souki despises and he‚Äôs been pretty vocal about it. The stock price tumbled 60% as a result of aggressive shorting since February and it appeared that the company isn‚Äôt going anywhere. 

However, they have recently repaid most of their debt and are about to start construction of their Driftwood LNG project this summer. They are said to be announcing commercial agreements over the next few weeks which is where the best part comes in‚Ä¶

If you have a browse through the options chain (https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tell/option-chain) you will notice the ridiculous open interest on Jan 22 calls with a strike price of‚Ä¶ 15usd!

It appears that insiders know that big volume contracts are coming and are betting on huge moves with the stock price coming back to its former glory. 

Combined with a significant short volume this has the potential to be a very explosive stock over the coming months.

Position: 9750 shares at 2.44usd

Hydrogen is \*already\* used to fuel transport. This is not a hypothetical, it's being done already, it works, it's viable. The Russians are investing heavily into it, as are BMW.

\> It's a total waste of resources

Water and electrical power? Hydrogen fuel is cheap as fuck to produce. You don't even need purified water.

\> barely any advantage at all

Aside from the zero CO2 emissions, being cheap to produce, and being light and easy to transport? As I've stated, renewable energy sources such as solar and wind have a particular problem with excess production at peak times. I've literally spoken with a wind turbine owner who can't sell the electricity due to a weak grid that can't take the load. As a result he has idle wind turbines. Hydrogen fuel production is his solution, it's cheap as hell to do, and electrolysis is an efficient process, unlike charging batteries.

This is not a hypothetical. Get off reddit, stop sucking Musks dick, get off ycombinator and all the other mainstream shit. Go talk to people in the real world who work in transportation, trucking, energy, whatever. Hydrogen production provides a solution to excess energy production, and that's not a small problem.",,

That's great dude, I never said otherwise. But far more people are buying Toyotas, far more people are buying BMWs, far more people are buying Audis, far more people are buying Fords.

Tesla are selling less than 2% of the cars sold in America. That's not unimpressive, they've beaten Nissan. But that absolutely does not justify a valuation that makes them worth more than all other car companies in the world, combined.

We hit the resistance at 416 but I don't think this is a problem. I think tomorrow could be flat with rotation plays and what not (energy will weigh it down). Monday we might test 410, and then head back for the ATH test like you said before. 

My main arguments right now are energy (Iran Deal and Israel ceasefire) oil will test March lows

Tech dip buying is over done, QQQ has been too strong compared to SPY. I think it will run out of steam. 

Commodities FUD around lumber, copper and steel needs to settle down, once market realises demand is still there regardless of inflation, this and also energy will carry SPY into June FOMC, which I think will be a non news event.

Jackson hole will be the taper announcement, so we will be back at SPY 400 but I do think we see 430-450 before we see 400.

Im not a fan of SPY puts, I do like VIX (not vxx etc) calls at the 25 strike when we settle at 15 or so (average in from 17)

First thing I notice is that periods of high variance returns are not sustained and they look possibly isolated, although there minor spikes before each big one.

https://preview.redd.it/ln6677wul1071.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c72c82557c3045a9575d857189931a84a693c24

On the other hand it looks like medium variance and low variance are in a constant switch off. We can see the almost perfect inversion between low variance probabilities and medium.

https://preview.redd.it/eqnl6ctzl1071.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f75444f4a5a854e7d842bb7f212c378c442f928

Most of those high variance returns come from changes from low to high variance. 

https://preview.redd.it/awjv82x4m1071.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=840a93a87d1745f84d79964cc296b8b282ff4153

This shows that high variance returns are more like *surprises* in the market because they come from low variance returns, its not a gradual buildup.  

**QQQ results**

QQQ‚Äôs results are very similar to SPY‚Äôs results. 

https://preview.redd.it/bqavsxmam1071.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad8be59558f24274d2ac689fa83e8c7a629de55

It seems like there are not *precursor* spikes in high variance returns, and the occur in isolation.  In this case it does seem like there is a sustained period of high variance returns in the early 2000s.  

https://preview.redd.it/gp4sc5yem1071.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=73c238b2a8657a2ada87e458ebc27140654a352f

The same cyclical inverse pattern occurs within the low and medium level regimes.

https://preview.redd.it/qqkq714km1071.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=899816666e35168b5e1756ee58dba86013739f5c

And consistent with SPY it seems like high variance regime spikes come from low variance to high variance.

https://preview.redd.it/cb5o3v2om1071.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89f554112e2b8dd2d79904a6aa6249b3326a31a

**Conclusions / Future areas to investigate**

¬∑ In CBOE VIX data is was common for large spikes in high variance to come from medium variance regimes, that does not seem to be the case for SPY or QQQ most of the high variance spikes come from changes from low variance to high variance

¬∑ Both QQQ and SPY exhibited what look like to be an inverse relationship between low and medium variance regimes. Confirming results and possibly making indicators could be comparing covariances and trends between the time series and then if a there is a *shift* that is probably a *break* in the relationship which probably leads to a time of high variance

¬∑ QQQ did exhibit high variance regime for a longer sustained time and that may be because of its growth-orientation.

 I hope to turn the codebase into a python-only repo so I can analyze the time series in a notebook a publish more of my findings.

2971,,2021-05-19 15:44:46,t3_ng99i7,,wallstreetbets,"Been watching this Gold setup develop since last November. It's been in the making for just about 10 years now. 

[$GC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/dudwlorvi3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb931a041ddf4f5b79d58c008d4badcb8b91b7c2)

First - let's take a look at the **1 year 1 day** chart. Here - we are breaking what appears to just be a broadening descending wedge (a massive one). The breakout point was **1853 -** and it needs to hold **1848** to stay intact. 

You can see we already got some follow through here. Now, price targets/resistances are **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3.** 

Keep in mind - the larger the pattern, the larger the move, **the longer it takes to play out.** This isn't going to happen overnight. Timeframe to complete the move is **3-6 months** \- and we could form lots of smaller patterns in between.

Every time we cross one of those resistances, it should become a support. Also note that upon reaching them, it's likely we consolidate for a few days. Overall - a super clean setup, and a play I've been eyeing since March. 

Lastly, keep in mind - for a setup of this magnitude, you want the **weekly close** for confirmation.

But - what makes this really interesting is the **10 year 1 week chart.**

[$GC 10 Year 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/ejdwc9xvj3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bdfbd8e014548cda17aaf6e754e28cd9abf651f)

Here, we have an absolutely massive cup and handle dating back to 2011. In this context - the addition of this data mainly means we can look for a much higher price target on the wedge breakout. 

As a result - I'm targeting $GC **2250 - 2500** within the next **year.** Remember what I said about timeframes. This could take quite a while. For this setup to trigger - I'm looking for the **monthly close** above that first breakout point.

And... that's it. Remember, technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. Fake outs can and do happen. That's why we identify **key levels** to tell where we are within a setup. Take it step by step.

***TL;DR -*** 

$GC above 1853 weekly close targets **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3**

$GC above 1853 monthly close targets **2250, 2500**

I'm planning to continue doing weekly relative rotation analysis of the market, but wanted to create this mid week post to take a quick look at UWMC. Please let me know if another flair is more appropriate.

I'm not going to get into the financials, since plenty of solid DD has been done on that already. However, I did mention in my last post (analyzing the market sectors) that I would look into positions related to the real estate sector (XLRE).

My thought process here it to take a look at the short term momentum for this stock due to the recent positive earnings, great financials, positive future outlook, and upcoming June Ex-Div date.

Lets jump into it and make it quick...

Since there is a lot of talk regarding Russell inclusion, here is the RRG of UWMC again UWM:

**My Thoughts:**

Personally, the company has strong fundamentals. So, in combination with the momentum, I think its a decent ""buy"" (this is not professional financial advice).

I'm playing this 3 ways:

6/18 short put x 2 @ $7

7/16 long call x 5 @ $6

1100 shares @ $8.06

Edit 1: Silly me, I forgot to mention that a share buyback plan was approved which also contributes to the positive momentum.

I should have shorted it, but I'm not rich. Here are some of her stances:

She predicts CoinBit $500,000.

She thinks gene editing is a sound investment at this time.

She has decreased her position in Netflix.

I think that the increase size of her fund will continue to limit her ability to invest in anything interesting. The longshots in her portfolio which have had massive success are often successful because her fund's investment has massively increased their market cap.  She has also tied herself so tightly to Tesla that she can never hop off that ride. She's tied to the autopilot whether it goes to the moon or into a tree. I'm not denying that she has had good results during this bull market, but I think a fund that goes the other direction will do very well over the next 5 years.

What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either. 

Here is some better and more thought out DD:

2996,,2021-05-19 20:14:45,t3_ngftx1,,wallstreetbets,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",ngftx1,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Mr. Cramer..."

Big tech's earnings absolutely destroyed estimates but sell side thinks it's due to lock down and people will rely on tech less once things open up. It's a consistent pattern that all the gains made after earning erode overnight or in a few trading session as if the good earning did not happen.

I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

3001,,2021-05-19 21:25:26,t3_nghmhm,,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",nghmhm,$NUE is strong as steel. Buy the dips.

Petco earnings is tomorrow pre-market. But this also might be a potential candidate for a short squeeze.

Short sellers are gearing up for a bad quarter. For the last three days, the short float increased from 4 point-something Monday, 6.05 yesterday, and today it's at 8.75.

In addition, short interest is up to 35.2%

To top it off, there are hardly any shares available to short, though borrowing rate remains at only 1%. For the last five days there were no more than 100k shares left to short.

3013,,2021-05-20 05:24:49,t3_ngrqqf,,wallstreetbets,"Some context: Cell carriers in the US have decided to stop the function of shared short codes (5-6 digit phone numbers) June 1. Shared short codes were the preferred means of SMS and MMS communication for B2C traffic. Short codes were free to lease in many cases, text messages were cheap, thousands of businesses could send from the same number, and throughput was incredibly high (lots of messages could be sent very fast).

The new policy enforced by the CTIA (The private club all major cell phone carriers are in) is that shared short codes are to be discontinued and replaced by dedicated short codes and A2P 10dlc (approved B2C traffic on 10-digit phone numbers). This means that every business/organization that wants to send texts must either apply for a dedicated short code or apply for a 10DLC. 

Dedicated short codes are the preferred choice for large corporations. They can handle large throughput and look good for the brand. However, they only cater to large corporations because they are thousands of dollars/year to lease. Turn around time for application is 4-6 weeks. Barrier to entry is high.

10DLC is the preferred choice for the smaller businesses since it's less expensive. But, it is still far more expensive than the shared short codes businesses are used to, requires application, and costs $50/mo in carrier and registration fees alone. Turn around time for application is less than a week. On top of fees, 10dlc isn't even fully ready. The Campaign Registry, the organization responsible for rolling out ""the new messaging standard"" for the CTIA, is still developing their API.

Enter Toll-free messaging. TF has 0 barrier to entry and can be issued to a business with SMS and MMS capabilities in seconds. It's the easiest and now the most cost-effective way to send commercial messages.

Conveniently, every major carrier announced this month (for the first time) that they will start collecting a $0.0025/message fee for every sms sent. They're ready for and expecting businesses to move to this method.

Who is Zipwhip: Zipwhip was given full reign over all TF traffic. Anyone in the US  that wants to send messages on TF codes uses Zipwhip in one way or another. They are a massive reseller that everyone is required to go through.

It was recently announced the Twilio plans on acquiring Zipwhip for $850M. Twilio is the leader is programmable messaging hands down. 

Honestly, there should be antitrust issues that arise and block the acquisition. If it goes through, Twilio owns the new world of business sms. Good chance regulators won't notice any issue. They'll miss the fact that businesses will be pressured into TF over their preferred solutions (dedicated short codes and A2P 10DLC) since it's unnecessarily complicated and expensive. TF is ready now and cheap.

TL;DR if Twilio successfully acquires Zipwhip, every small to medium sized business that wants to send texts will have to go through them. Every single one of them in the US.",ngrqqf,$TWLO stands to be the primary source for commercial text messaging

3016,,2021-05-20 08:25:07,t3_ngulnq,,wallstreetbets,"So just how big is **today's news about the initial success of the Sofusa technology**?

1st, this is a technology that aims at lymphatic delivery. 

**What does this mean?** Well, when trying to fight a disease, it's difficult to target the lymphatic system. Because of how it works and the fact that it is spread throughout our body. 

So there are MANY, MANY drugs out there that treat several conditions through the lymphatic system. But, because of what we just explained, those drugs sometimes don't work. They are not properly ""delivered"". They don't get to where they need to get to make the necessary interaction and solve the problem.

**Sorrento has developed a technology that can deliver drugs to where they actually need to go** in the lymphatic system. So this is definitely breakthrough technology. Other companies are aiming to find similar solutions. But we are definitely talking about very advanced bio-tech.

In this case, we have a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. This is a condition that worsens with time. It's very painful and limits the patient's movement. It's not very common, so we are talking about 1.5 million people in the USA and about 30 million worldwide. 

But remember, **the technology Sorrento is developing  will be able to deliver drugs treating many other diseases** related to the lymphatic system. So the market for Sofusa is very, very large.

The press release tells us Sofusa was tested on ""First Enbrel-Non-Responding"" patients. 

**What does this mean?** Patients who need the drug Enbrel and, even though they have not been taking the drug for long (it's a ""first"" for them) they are not responding to it. It isn't helping them. 

Now, Sofusa comes into play. It's job is to deliver Enbrel to the patient effectively. To ""take"" Enbrel to where it needs to go in the lymphatic system.. 

The 1st obvious advantage is that the drug wasn't helping and now helps. But there are other important advantages.

Since the drug is being carried to its targeted ""destination"" the dosage needed, diminishes. Because less is ""lost along the way"". This is important because many diseases related to the lymphatic system, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are chronic, lifelong conditions. Being able to administer less drugs really helps the patient. Now you have a drug that actually works, more potently, which reduces its dosage. All this thanks to Sorrento.

The press release points out an important factor: This is a trial on ONE type of drug/treatment. Other such trials testing the effectiveness of Sofusa are already taking place. Again, this is proof of the potentially huge market for this delivery system.

Just to get an idea, the release mentions anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. These are a type of drugs that inhibit the activity of certain proteins (they inhibit PD1 and CTLA4, which are types of proteins. By stopping their activity, they help in stopping the growth of cancer tumors). There are several drugs that fall under these categories and treat a wide variety of cancers. **Sofusa can potentially play a vital role in all these treatments**. 

This is like several companies developing apps while Sorrento is developing a new smartphone technology. Each app has its rightful use and market. But once the new smartphone is up and working, all apps will need it. So this technology has huge revenue implications. T**he fact we are hearing good news about it is HUGE**.

As for the results themselves: **The DAS28 test measures rheumatoid activity in 28 joints** in the patient's body. The joints might be swollen or tender (hurting).

This patient had a DAS28 score of 4.6, with 18 out of 28 joints compromised.  That is considered  moderate to high disease activity.  There are 4 levels of DAS 28 scores going from remission (the best) to high (the worst). So this patient was not in the worst shape going in, but pretty bad.

Using Sofusa to deliver the Enbrel drug, in just 4 weeks (this is a very short time for this type of disease!!) the results went from 4.6 to 3.0. The total amount of compromised joints, from 18 to 11. **That is a dramatic change**. The patient went from being somewhere between level 3 and 4, to being in the lower level 2, called ""low disease activity"", which indicates it's moving towards remission (the lowest level). For someone suffering from this condition, it's a real life changer. For the company selling Enbrel, it's a real market changer. And if it can equally help people with tumors, **Sofusa becomes a major therapeutic factor.** 

I hope investors understand this. **It's another major development in an already extremely promising pipeline** which is currently badly undervalued. If the price doesn't spike today by 10-15%, as it should, just from this news, it would be disappointing. 

But if you are long, today's price change isn't what matters the most. It‚Äôs the understanding that Sorrento / SRNE has ANOTHER ace in its hand!",ngulnq,How Big is SRNE news release about Sofusa success?

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC and its +23% run in the past week. A stock with a massive dividend. A stock trading with a very low P/E of and income growth of 4,200%.

So why is this stock still a buy and hold for me right now?

The CEO is positioning them to increase shareholder value, but also position the company to weather any reduction in the refi market. (65% of the business)

There are major catalysts that have been driving the increase in price that goes beyond the attention gained on WSB.

* Announced **NET earnings of $860M in the first quarter,** with huge margins.
* Reaffirmed a continued dividend, the next ex-dividend date is **6/9/2021**.
* Announced a **$300M stock buyback, representing as much as 40% of the free float** at the current prices.
* Russell index inclusion was missed last quarter due to confusion about their PREVIOUS status as a SPAC. It is expected that they will be reconsidered for Russell Index inclusions in the yearly reconstitution. While not the biggest catalyst, this is a sign of reputation and long-term stability for the stock. **The prelim list publishes 6/4/2021.**
* Creation of a jumbo mortgage product. The average loan origination in the market is \~410,000, indicating that the non-conforming section of the mortgage market is *exploding.* This is a very profitable sector of loan origination.

Other fundamentals driving a buy recommendation:

* Small float. 90M float, of which only about 60M is freely trading.
* This stock is not persistently pressured down quite as hard as others due to low share availability, but it appears based on the last two weeks it's trading the small waves of this stock to try to push it down under dangerous strike prices. A wave of positive sentiment could strangle this position in the stock. I don't have a Bloomberg terminal, but based on the evidence over the last several days, the indication is the 13.1% SI has grown.
* Exceptional open option interest for **tomorrow 5/21/2021.** The options expiring tomorrow have been documented elsewhere so I won't belabor them, but the open interest at the $9, and $10 strike represent almost 10% of the free float.
* Not a new startup, **they have been in this business since 1986**, making them almost as old as a fossil like me. They clearly survived the 2008 storm. This company isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

The cherry:

* **STILL forecasting growth in Q2**, whereas many of its competitors are not.

This post is NOT financial advice, but as someone who has ridden the waves of this stock since it was about $9, I see this position turning positive and the outlook through July for this position has high sentiment. Even if the mortgage market slows down as expected, I will hold these shares for years to come for the dividends and general stability of the organization.

My position 8000 shares @ 7.65 and 45x 6/18 8c. You can go stalk the fuck out of me if you want to see that I've been talking about this stock for some time and been saying the same thing about the strength and targets of their position since March. I am also the guy that tells you when you unintentionally reveal personal info on your yolo screenshots!

TLDR: UWMC should garner close attention for value investors looking for undervalued positions.

3027,,2021-05-20 13:28:43,t3_nh08j4,,wallstreetbets,"**Investment Thesis**

Overall, what makes MDXG a good buying opportunity right now is a combination of two factors.

* Number one is management‚Äôs miscommunication with the market. The market currently believes that wound care is the core business of MDXG, is not entirely aware of the potential of its biopharma pipeline and more specifically its Amniofix drug, and has priced the company based on this.¬†
* Number two is the huge potential of the Amniofix treatment and its ability to become the next blockbuster in the healthcare space after the conclusion of its phase 3 trial.

**Idea Summary**

MiMedx Group *(MDXG)* is a leading BioPharma and wound care business whose value has been drastically misunderstood by the market. Through drivers such as miscommunication from management about the company‚Äôs valued proposition as well as the lack of institutional investor coverage, the market currently believes that the majority of the company‚Äôs value sits in its low growth wound care business. In reality, its major competitive advantage is within its osteoarthritis drug Amniofix which has the potential to become the next blockbuster after it clears phase III clinical trials. A sum of the parts valuation was used to determine a minimum implied upside of at least 300%. Risks are discussed at the end.

**Business Overview**

MiMedx Group is a leading biopharma and advanced wound care business utilizing human placental tissues to develop products used in the healthcare sector. It processes placental tissues using its patented processes to produce allografts, which are tissues transplanted from one person to another for wound care and regeneration. These allografts are effective in healing difficult wounds because of the ability of the allograft cells to quickly associate with the cells of the patient, thereby taking part in the healing process, easing the ability of the body to close the wound, and speeding up the body‚Äôs regeneration process.

MDXG‚Äôs product offerings can be split into two business segments: wound care and biopharma (surgical solutions). Its flagship product Epifix and additional product Epicord fall under its wound care umbrella, and its flagship product Amniofix as well as additional products Amniocord, Amniofill, and Epiburn fall under its biopharma umbrella. The wound care products service the broad wound care industry, targeting specifically chronic wounds. The biopharma product line is more specific, with the flagship treatment Amniofix targeting knee osteoarthritis in specific.¬†

MDXG sells through direct sales, sales agents, and distributors in the United States. This past quarter, 95% of its sales were direct to customers such as healthcare professionals and facilities.¬†

**Internal Analysis**

The past 3 years have not been ideal for MDXG. Its revenues began to dip in 2018 around the time of their accounting scandal, the growth went from 40% in 2018, to 11% in 2019, and is currently around -16%. This sent their stock price tumbling from $16 USD to lows of almost $1 USD, though it is currently trading at $9 with new updates on their biopharma pipeline.

Their gross margin has stayed very high, around 80% while their EBITDA margins have dropped over the years. Though it wasn‚Äôt explicitly disclosed, a large part of this drop in EBITDA margins has been attributed to a temporary increase in legal fees due to the litigation MDXG has faced this past year. Its decreased volume may have also suppressed margins as the number of wound care treatments in hospitals significantly dropped during COVID-19.¬†

The company‚Äôs cash balance is sitting at a very high level of 84 mm. This is in large part due to its recent capital raise, which happened to be strongly criticized by one of MDXG‚Äôs activist investors, Prescience Point Capital (discussed in detail later).

**External Analysis**

*Wound Care Market*

The global wound care market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% from 2021 to 2028. This has been driven by the aging population and rising rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Wound care products are increasingly being used to prevent and surgical site infections.¬†

Though the overall market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% the specific advanced product segment which includes products such as those of MDXG‚Äôs which target chronic and non-healing wounds, is projected to grow much faster than 4.1%.¬†

The wound care market is relatively fragmented, with large players such as Integra LifeSciences, 3M, Johnson & Johnson, and Medtronic competing to gain the most market share. MDXG‚Äôs direct competition for its allograft advanced wound care treatments include Organogenesis, Axogen, Mediwound, and Vericel.¬†

Organogenesis is currently in the lead in this niche market, and while MDXG reported an 11% YoY decline in sales in 2020 (which has already been factored into the current price), Organogenesis reported a 30% increase. This is evident when comparing the stock performance of both companies over the past year (figure 1)

*Osteoarthritis Therapy Market*

91 million U.S. adults have arthritis, 20M have knee OA, and \~32 million per year are currently treated for plantar fasciitis, which is specifically targeted by MDXG‚Äôs Amniofix drug. There are very few FDA approved treatments for knee OA and plantar fasciitis, and those that exist have low efficacy and many drawbacks. Amniofix is currently the only treatment of its nature in phase 3 clinical trials that have posted very positive results in both company and independent trials, has been used off-label by >100K patients with zero severe adverse effects, and consistently demonstrates a significant reduction in pain as reported by patients. In addition, Amniofix has an RMAT (regenerative medicine advanced therapy) designation granted by the FDA which allows for MDXG to benefit from an expedited approval process from the FDA.

*Management Miscommunication*

The current market opinion of MDXG has been blurred by the miscommunication from company management whose goals do not align with maximizing shareholder value. This is largely due to the fact that EW healthcare, a private equity firm, has 33% representation on the board as a result of its 17% stake. From a corporate finance perspective, a private equity firm‚Äôs interests do not generally tend to align with those of public shareholders. Their influence has been exacerbated by the fact that there are no large institutional holdings in MDXG as of yet other than Prescience Point, and there has been minimal coverage on the stock leading to the market‚Äôs opinion on the company being heavily skewed by management communications.¬†

MDXG‚Äôs current growth strategy is focused on roll-ups in the wound care space. This is very characteristic of a private equity playbook, and goes alongside EW‚Äôs historical acquisitions. As was mentioned in the external analysis, the wound care space is growing at a slow rate of \~4.1%, however MDXG has lost significant market share to Organogenesis. Management has failed to realize that the current value driver of the business is within its biopharma line and not its wound care line, yet has continually communicated to shareholders that it believes it is in fact wound care and it is going to continue investing in growing within the industry.

Prescience Point Capital, an activist investor group which has advocated for change in MDXG's communication strategy, has supported the fact that MDXG‚Äôs communications have been focused on the wrong industry. At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, the potential for the drug Amniofix was drastically undersold and much time was spent convincing investors that the core business is in wound care. The 3.6% decline in shares two days after the conference illustrates how effective this strategy was.¬†

There has been strong opposition from MDXG‚Äôs board of directors to Prescience Point‚Äôs activist efforts. In a shareholder letter in early May, prior to their annual meeting, the company communicated that they believe the wound care and regenerative medicine direction being followed now is ideal. They stated that the activist investor does not understand pharmaceutical company disclosure and were advocating for speculative actions themselves though Prescience‚Äôs report discusses the opposite, with them outlining how EW‚Äôs influence on the board of directors is shifting the company‚Äôs focus away from maximizing shareholder value.

*Amniofix*

As mentioned in the external analysis, there is currently no other treatment, either in development or on the market, as effective as Amniofix in treating knee OA and also just as safe. Most recently, at its Q1 earnings call, MDXG CEO shared positive results from the phase IIb prospective trial of the treatment. There was a statistically significant reduction in VAS (visual analog score) for pain and an improvement in the foot function index score. There were also no serious adverse events during this clinical trial. Amniofix is currently in phase III trials, and MDXG believes they are on target to meet all criteria needed to find a biologics license application (BLA) so that the treatment can be introduced to the general public. MDXG is aiming to file their BLA in the first half of 2022, meaning that within a year this blockbuster treatment could be on the market, and given the feedback so far from clinical trials as well as the RMAT designation, it is highly likely.

A Prescience Point market capture analysis estimated that the treatment would bring in $4,050 million of annual sales. This is \~8 times higher than the current sales brought in through wound care. One year ago it would have been prudent to not entirely incorporate this into the share price, however today with clinical trials nearing completion and MDXG‚Äôs new RMAT designation, the likelihood of approval is much higher.

**Valuation**

From a valuation point of view, a quick sum of the parts analysis is the most ideal given the two different business lines of MDXG. A more in-depth DCF can be created once more cost information is provided from MDXG after the conclusion of clinical trials.

Shares outstanding of 109.8 mm, total debt of 51.8 mm, and total cash of 84.7mm were used to convert from enterprise value to equity value. The current implied upside was calculated using the current price of $9.46.

*Wound Care Valuation*

MDXG‚Äôs FY 2021 sales guidance assumed $255 mm to $270 mm in revenue from the wound care segment. Different points in this revenue ranged were used for the low, base, and high cases of the valuation. An EV/Revenue multiple was used to calculate implied enterprise value. The comparables analysis shown in figure 2 illustrated the median multiples derived from the analysis done using the aforementioned list of MDXG‚Äôs competitors. A median multiple of 5.3x was used. The median was used and not marked down because the gross margin and UFCF yield of MDXG is in-line with all competitors. Though the EBIDTA multiple was lower, the similar yield and gross margins indicate that company performance is relatively the same. In addition, litigation expenses factored into the lower EBIDTA multiples and thus it is not indicative of recurring performance.

Based on the revenue multiples, implied share values for the wound care segment range between $12.0 and $12.8.

**Wound Care Equity Value**

**Biopharma Valuation**

Prescience Point estimated annual revenues from Amniofix through using the market capture method. The total market size (annual knee OA injections) was estimated, and a capture percentage was applied to determine the annual number of patients receiving the Amniofix injection. Prescience assumed 1.5 injections per year but to be more conservative in this valuation 1 was used. Price per injection and FDA approval probability varied by the cases and were used to adjust the EV/Rev multiple downwards. Overall, an implied share value range between $25.4 and $57.1 was calculated for this segment.

https://preview.redd.it/we0pw4jm1a071.png?width=611&format=png&auto=webp&s=567d19cc5acc59acbe552a2afcf09789c80866ff

**Biopharma Equity Value**

Overall, the total implied share price ranges between $37.43 to $69.81. As more information regarding Amniofix comes out including the price of manufacturing, different multiples can be used to fine-tune the analysis.

https://preview.redd.it/a8035yfo1a071.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=12e0f9a041e326b505bfda25304261367c651406

**Risks**

1. Given the high influence EW healthcare has on the board of directors, there is potential for more value to describe acquisitions such as that of stability biologics, which was bought for 10 million and sold for 3.5 million 3 years later. If such a trend continues, the value of MDXG‚Äôs wound care business can dramatically decrease, which will hurt the share pierce
2. The FDA approval of Amniofix is a large driver of the valuation calculated. There is a large risk that the FDA will not approve the treatment, however, with the RMAT designation in place and positive results from the first two phases of clinical trials, the odds are strongly in the favour of the approval at the current point in time.

Overall MDXG has been strongly misrepresented by management leading to a skewed opinion and pricing by the market.",nh08j4,$MDXG - Management Miscommunication Skews Valuation Down and Creates Great Buying Opportunity

For those who don't know, $EEM - or the iShares Emerging Markets ETF - is comprised of stocks from developing nations, with a **ton** of room to grow. These countries **will** all catch up soon, it's only a matter of time. This is one of the many reasons I find this setup especially interesting.

Here are the top holdings:

[$EEM Holdings \(By Country\)](https://preview.redd.it/zh7nwb2hfa071.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cb2749a2c7d6c7f548ad89a3f9a746b56d2273)

Next, let's dig into the charts -

Chart 1: **Max Monthly (\~16 Years)**

[$EEM Max Monthly](https://preview.redd.it/ylknrqzhea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=91ee9718b89c47744e6f68224a133c48c7bcfc6f)

Here you can see we have a **symmetrical triangle** pattern that dates back to late 2007. In technical analysis, the longer the pattern has been building, the more significant the breakout will be. Subsequently - you can imagine the magnitude a pattern like this has.

When making new all time highs I like to look for psychological resistances. As a result - logical targets for this pattern are **75.00, 100.00.** Sounds simple, but it works in practice. Keep in mind - something like this will take **3 - 5 years** to play out. This is a position trade.

In order for this breakout to stay valid - we need to continue getting monthly closes above **50.85.** You can see we've pretty much gone perfectly sideways since breaking out for **4 months** now.

This is **bullish -** moving sideways in a higher range is always biased to the upside (except in special situations with certain reversal patterns). Not only that, but we've been forming an interesting setup on the next chart I will show you all -

Chart 2: **1 Year 1 Day**

[$EEM 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/7hy7wbqeea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8102c5b1f0e92c02260cfccc6b8d77eafea8035d)

On this chart - you can make much more sense of those 4 months of sideways. We are actually working on a large **falling wedge** \- which is a bullish continuation pattern. The breakout point for this is sitting around **54.37** as I am writing this (5/20/2021).

Upon breaking this (ignoring the previous chart) - we would target **54.94, 56.49, 57.32, 60.00, 65.00.** That would be if there was no setup on the monthly chart. Each of these are resistances we could stop and consolidate at. I like to scale in after breaking each resistance. Scale into winners and cut losers fast. A break from a pattern like this would probably take **3 - 6 months** to play out.

I also want to note that **MASSIVE** increase in volume on 3/26. Generally - an uptick on volume when price is doing what you want it to is always a plus. But one like that is very intriguing - on a huge green candle too. My guess would be someone loaded their bags there (or a group of players).

And... **that's it.** Keep it simple. Those are often the best setups.

***TL;DR -***

$EEM has a big pattern - broke out 4 months ago just chopping sideways waiting for the move to happen.

Price targets **75.00, 100.00**

Stop out below **50.87** monthly close

Timeframe **3-5 years**

It also has a smaller pattern above that one - which breaks out above **54.37** and has a shorter time horizon.

Price targets **60.00, 65.00**

Stop out if we close back inside

Timeframe **3-6 months**

\- Research coming out of John Hopkins University is suggesting that the use of Psilocybin is the most effective drug ever tested as a remedy for depression, anxiety, and PTSD. As the United States is currently under crisis in its battle against mental illness, these results are too impressive to ignore, even if it may need to overcome pressures from big pharma interest groups that seek to quell the expansion of this research.

\- These drugs have been extremely effective in treating addiction -- particularly alcohol and nicotine. Considering the government expenditure on the opioid crisis, once this proves to be an effective treatment, the government will expedite the medicinal legalization of the substances that MNMD has been treating/experimenting with.

\- Veterans, the most respected occupational category (statistically,) have begun launching advocacy groups for the widespread medicinal legalization of these substances due to their effectiveness against PTSD. These therapeutic measures have contributed to the plummeting of suicide rates (those treated w/ psilocybin vs. control group.) The Biden administration will have to choose ethics and reason over the suffering of veterans (former government employees) which I anticipate that they will given mounting pressure due to the effectiveness of these treatments.

&#x200B;

Does this hinge on expected earnings in the long-run ... certainly!

&#x200B;

But the effectiveness of this research is undeniable and can no longer be overlooked ... because of new cultural acceptance of these alternative treatments the government's hand will be forced in legalize, or otherwise be responsible for mental illness and addiction -- all of which could be treated and cured.

3037,,2021-05-20 16:06:53,t3_nh45af,,wallstreetbets,"I want to first start off by saying that I'm not liable for financial losses. I recently built an app that can generate efficient frontiers when you plug in individual US Equities. 

If you aren't familiar with the efficient frontier, what it tries to find is the *mean-variance portfolio.* This type of model deals with portfolio management / optimization. In terms of the efficient frontier you are trying to find the best portfolio allocation weights that give you the best risk adjusted returns. 

**In simple words:** you give it stocks and it tells you the best percentage holdings

I recently built an app on some python code that does this sort of optimization. There is no programming required to use the app. When running the app it will give two portfolios, minimum variance, and maximized sharpe (same as mean-variance, mean-markowitz). Minimum variance will tell you the least riskiest holding strategy (green), and max sharpe will give you the best reward-for-risk holding (red). I call that portfolio *the-juice-is-worth-the-squeeze.* Here is a sample output.

I used around 100,000 simulations, and 10Y of adjusted close data. 

The reason why I bring this up is because it does two things. The first is that it promotes portfolio diversification, which I know is pretty uncommon here. Also it finds the most aggressive returns in terms of minimizing risk. If you have high returns and wonder why you returns are so much higher than standard investment funds its probably because you are here

How high could it go?

* Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks

* WDC Fundamentals

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community.

A little bit about myself for context:

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/555339dhob071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42585b1cfe4cf1c85eab62b0cc01791f5321f1e2

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",nh8f2j,PUBM DD #1

3051,,2021-05-20 19:09:28,t3_nh8q8x,,wallstreetbets," So this is the first time I've ever played around with options and I'm probably doing it in a dumb way but get that's more fun for you guys to watch. I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

This is not financial advice but...

Now that Tellurian (TELL) has crossed the 1bln market cap, you are ready to find out about what has the potential to be your biggest play this year.

Tellurian is a stock that‚Äôs been rattled by short sellers, whom the chairman Charif Souki despises and he‚Äôs been pretty vocal about it. The stock price tumbled 60% as a result of aggressive shorting since February and it appeared that the company isn‚Äôt going anywhere. 

However, they have recently repaid most of their debt and are about to start construction of their Driftwood LNG project this summer. They are said to be announcing commercial agreements over the next few weeks which is where the best part comes in‚Ä¶

If you have a browse through the options chain (https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tell/option-chain) you will notice the ridiculous open interest on Jan 22 calls with a strike price of‚Ä¶ 15usd!

It appears that insiders know that big volume contracts are coming and are betting on huge moves with the stock price coming back to its former glory. 

Combined with a significant short volume this has the potential to be a very explosive stock over the coming months.

Position: 9750 shares at 2.44usd

First off, food and energy prices are in there, and with the exception of gas, lag very far behind the index as a whole. Gas on the other hand jumped way up this year, but otherwise hasn‚Äôt been particularly inflating over the last ten. Utilities in particular had something like 15% inflation over the last 10 years, and that accounts for half of most people‚Äôs energy expenses.

On the part about wages: I believe this chart shows an increasing drive towards assets, which implies that the greatest source of inflation in the last ten years comes from asset prices, not the weak wage growth and subsequent spending shown in the last chart. Moreover, if you look at a chart of productivity vs wage growth in the last 50 years, you‚Äôll notice that estimated productivity continues to rise radically, while wages begin to flatline in the ‚Äò70s. If what you‚Äôre saying is true, then we could expect to have extreme deflation over that period- fewer wage dollars are now chasing relatively more goods. But capital and rentier income has grown massively at the same time, offsetting that effect. 

The main place I‚Äôd argue you can see that effect in action is the difference between inflation in essential consumer goods, and in luxury goods and assets. Consumer goods have a really hard time inflating, while assets are free to explode. That‚Äôs because wages haven‚Äôt grown, so poor people have the same amount of money to spend as in the 70‚Äôs",,

This is called retained earnings and it gives the company the ability to compound their profits into more profits. An example: PUBM rolled out their CTV solution rapidly because they have the engineering resources to do it. They invest let's say 5 million of their previous profits into a CTV product (I have no idea how much that project cost). Once they cross sell the product to their customer base, they generate more revenue and therefore more profits. This compounding effect will eventually grow the value of the company as the money compounds. Earnings and revenue will go up. Dividends are more common among mature companies that can't find ways to compound the money, so they simply give it back to their investors. PUBM has growth opportunities ahead of it.",,

\- One stock was tooling along at about $243 and change and suddenly it dropped 13% just for about 30 seconds and then came back to where it was.  
\- Another stock was sitting at $18 something and there was a bid out there for $8.75.  
What my smooth brain cannot comprehend is why these things were happening.   
\- Was I seeing a directed trade on the $243 stock at a discount?  
\- Was the $8.75 bid just someone hoping to pick up a bargain if someone dropped some stocks in at ""market price""?

[$GC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/dudwlorvi3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb931a041ddf4f5b79d58c008d4badcb8b91b7c2)

First - let's take a look at the **1 year 1 day** chart. Here - we are breaking what appears to just be a broadening descending wedge (a massive one). The breakout point was **1853 -** and it needs to hold **1848** to stay intact. 

You can see we already got some follow through here. Now, price targets/resistances are **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3.** 

Keep in mind - the larger the pattern, the larger the move, **the longer it takes to play out.** This isn't going to happen overnight. Timeframe to complete the move is **3-6 months** \- and we could form lots of smaller patterns in between.

Every time we cross one of those resistances, it should become a support. Also note that upon reaching them, it's likely we consolidate for a few days. Overall - a super clean setup, and a play I've been eyeing since March. 

Lastly, keep in mind - for a setup of this magnitude, you want the **weekly close** for confirmation.

But - what makes this really interesting is the **10 year 1 week chart.**

[$GC 10 Year 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/ejdwc9xvj3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bdfbd8e014548cda17aaf6e754e28cd9abf651f)

Here, we have an absolutely massive cup and handle dating back to 2011. In this context - the addition of this data mainly means we can look for a much higher price target on the wedge breakout. 

As a result - I'm targeting $GC **2250 - 2500** within the next **year.** Remember what I said about timeframes. This could take quite a while. For this setup to trigger - I'm looking for the **monthly close** above that first breakout point.

And... that's it. Remember, technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. Fake outs can and do happen. That's why we identify **key levels** to tell where we are within a setup. Take it step by step.

***TL;DR -*** 

$GC above 1853 weekly close targets **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3**

$GC above 1853 monthly close targets **2250, 2500**

I'm planning to continue doing weekly relative rotation analysis of the market, but wanted to create this mid week post to take a quick look at UWMC. Please let me know if another flair is more appropriate.

I'm not going to get into the financials, since plenty of solid DD has been done on that already. However, I did mention in my last post (analyzing the market sectors) that I would look into positions related to the real estate sector (XLRE).

My thought process here it to take a look at the short term momentum for this stock due to the recent positive earnings, great financials, positive future outlook, and upcoming June Ex-Div date.

Lets jump into it and make it quick...

Since there is a lot of talk regarding Russell inclusion, here is the RRG of UWMC again UWM:

**My Thoughts:**

Personally, the company has strong fundamentals. So, in combination with the momentum, I think its a decent ""buy"" (this is not professional financial advice).

I'm playing this 3 ways:

6/18 short put x 2 @ $7

7/16 long call x 5 @ $6

1100 shares @ $8.06

Edit 1: Silly me, I forgot to mention that a share buyback plan was approved which also contributes to the positive momentum.

She has decreased her position in Netflix.

I think that the increase size of her fund will continue to limit her ability to invest in anything interesting. The longshots in her portfolio which have had massive success are often successful because her fund's investment has massively increased their market cap.  She has also tied herself so tightly to Tesla that she can never hop off that ride. She's tied to the autopilot whether it goes to the moon or into a tree.

What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either. 

Here is some better and more thought out DD:

3535,,2021-05-19 20:14:45,t3_ngftx1,,wallstreetbets,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",ngftx1,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Mr. Cramer..."

Big tech's earnings absolutely destroyed estimates but sell side thinks it's due to lock down and people will rely on tech less once things open up. It's a consistent pattern that all the gains made after earning erode overnight or in a few trading session as if the good earning did not happen.

3538,,2021-05-19 20:51:00,t3_nggpql,,wallstreetbets,"I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

3540,,2021-05-19 21:25:26,t3_nghmhm,,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",nghmhm,$NUE is strong as steel. Buy the dips.

Petco earnings is tomorrow pre-market. But this also might be a potential candidate for a short squeeze.

Short sellers are gearing up for a bad quarter. For the last three days, the short float increased from 4 point-something Monday, 6.05 yesterday, and today it's at 8.75.

In addition, short interest is up to 35.2%

To top it off, there are hardly any shares available to short, though borrowing rate remains at only 1%. For the last five days there were no more than 100k shares left to short.

The average price target is $28, but if earnings goes better than expected, this could be the catalyst for something significantly bigger. Listen to your pets' beckoning calls, and keep this on your watch list!

3552,,2021-05-20 05:24:49,t3_ngrqqf,,wallstreetbets,"Some context: Cell carriers in the US have decided to stop the function of shared short codes (5-6 digit phone numbers) June 1. Shared short codes were the preferred means of SMS and MMS communication for B2C traffic. Short codes were free to lease in many cases, text messages were cheap, thousands of businesses could send from the same number, and throughput was incredibly high (lots of messages could be sent very fast).

The new policy enforced by the CTIA (The private club all major cell phone carriers are in) is that shared short codes are to be discontinued and replaced by dedicated short codes and A2P 10dlc (approved B2C traffic on 10-digit phone numbers). This means that every business/organization that wants to send texts must either apply for a dedicated short code or apply for a 10DLC. 

Dedicated short codes are the preferred choice for large corporations. They can handle large throughput and look good for the brand. However, they only cater to large corporations because they are thousands of dollars/year to lease. Turn around time for application is 4-6 weeks. Barrier to entry is high.

10DLC is the preferred choice for the smaller businesses since it's less expensive. But, it is still far more expensive than the shared short codes businesses are used to, requires application, and costs $50/mo in carrier and registration fees alone. Turn around time for application is less than a week. On top of fees, 10dlc isn't even fully ready. The Campaign Registry, the organization responsible for rolling out ""the new messaging standard"" for the CTIA, is still developing their API.

Enter Toll-free messaging. TF has 0 barrier to entry and can be issued to a business with SMS and MMS capabilities in seconds. It's the easiest and now the most cost-effective way to send commercial messages.

Conveniently, every major carrier announced this month (for the first time) that they will start collecting a $0.0025/message fee for every sms sent. They're ready for and expecting businesses to move to this method.

Who is Zipwhip: Zipwhip was given full reign over all TF traffic. Anyone in the US  that wants to send messages on TF codes uses Zipwhip in one way or another. They are a massive reseller that everyone is required to go through.

It was recently announced the Twilio plans on acquiring Zipwhip for $850M. Twilio is the leader is programmable messaging hands down. 

Honestly, there should be antitrust issues that arise and block the acquisition. If it goes through, Twilio owns the new world of business sms. Good chance regulators won't notice any issue. They'll miss the fact that businesses will be pressured into TF over their preferred solutions (dedicated short codes and A2P 10DLC) since it's unnecessarily complicated and expensive. TF is ready now and cheap.

TL;DR if Twilio successfully acquires Zipwhip, every small to medium sized business that wants to send texts will have to go through them. Every single one of them in the US.",ngrqqf,$TWLO stands to be the primary source for commercial text messaging

3555,,2021-05-20 08:25:07,t3_ngulnq,,wallstreetbets,"So just how big is **today's news about the initial success of the Sofusa technology**?

1st, this is a technology that aims at lymphatic delivery. 

**What does this mean?** Well, when trying to fight a disease, it's difficult to target the lymphatic system. Because of how it works and the fact that it is spread throughout our body. 

So there are MANY, MANY drugs out there that treat several conditions through the lymphatic system. But, because of what we just explained, those drugs sometimes don't work. They are not properly ""delivered"". They don't get to where they need to get to make the necessary interaction and solve the problem.

**Sorrento has developed a technology that can deliver drugs to where they actually need to go** in the lymphatic system. So this is definitely breakthrough technology. Other companies are aiming to find similar solutions. But we are definitely talking about very advanced bio-tech.

In this case, we have a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. This is a condition that worsens with time. It's very painful and limits the patient's movement. It's not very common, so we are talking about 1.5 million people in the USA and about 30 million worldwide. 

But remember, **the technology Sorrento is developing  will be able to deliver drugs treating many other diseases** related to the lymphatic system. So the market for Sofusa is very, very large.

The press release tells us Sofusa was tested on ""First Enbrel-Non-Responding"" patients. 

**What does this mean?** Patients who need the drug Enbrel and, even though they have not been taking the drug for long (it's a ""first"" for them) they are not responding to it. It isn't helping them. 

Now, Sofusa comes into play. It's job is to deliver Enbrel to the patient effectively. To ""take"" Enbrel to where it needs to go in the lymphatic system.. 

The 1st obvious advantage is that the drug wasn't helping and now helps. But there are other important advantages.

Since the drug is being carried to its targeted ""destination"" the dosage needed, diminishes. Because less is ""lost along the way"". This is important because many diseases related to the lymphatic system, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are chronic, lifelong conditions. Being able to administer less drugs really helps the patient. Now you have a drug that actually works, more potently, which reduces its dosage. All this thanks to Sorrento.

The press release points out an important factor: This is a trial on ONE type of drug/treatment. Other such trials testing the effectiveness of Sofusa are already taking place. Again, this is proof of the potentially huge market for this delivery system.

Just to get an idea, the release mentions anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. These are a type of drugs that inhibit the activity of certain proteins (they inhibit PD1 and CTLA4, which are types of proteins. By stopping their activity, they help in stopping the growth of cancer tumors). There are several drugs that fall under these categories and treat a wide variety of cancers. **Sofusa can potentially play a vital role in all these treatments**. 

This is like several companies developing apps while Sorrento is developing a new smartphone technology. Each app has its rightful use and market. But once the new smartphone is up and working, all apps will need it. So this technology has huge revenue implications. T**he fact we are hearing good news about it is HUGE**.

As for the results themselves: **The DAS28 test measures rheumatoid activity in 28 joints** in the patient's body. The joints might be swollen or tender (hurting).

This patient had a DAS28 score of 4.6, with 18 out of 28 joints compromised.  That is considered  moderate to high disease activity.  There are 4 levels of DAS 28 scores going from remission (the best) to high (the worst). So this patient was not in the worst shape going in, but pretty bad.

Using Sofusa to deliver the Enbrel drug, in just 4 weeks (this is a very short time for this type of disease!!) the results went from 4.6 to 3.0. The total amount of compromised joints, from 18 to 11. **That is a dramatic change**. The patient went from being somewhere between level 3 and 4, to being in the lower level 2, called ""low disease activity"", which indicates it's moving towards remission (the lowest level). For someone suffering from this condition, it's a real life changer. For the company selling Enbrel, it's a real market changer. And if it can equally help people with tumors, **Sofusa becomes a major therapeutic factor.**

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC and its +23% run in the past week. A stock with a massive dividend. A stock trading with a very low P/E of and income growth of 4,200%.

So why is this stock still a buy and hold for me right now?

The CEO is positioning them to increase shareholder value, but also position the company to weather any reduction in the refi market. (65% of the business)

There are major catalysts that have been driving the increase in price that goes beyond the attention gained on WSB.

* Announced **NET earnings of $860M in the first quarter,** with huge margins.
* Reaffirmed a continued dividend, the next ex-dividend date is **6/9/2021**.
* Announced a **$300M stock buyback, representing as much as 40% of the free float** at the current prices.
* Russell index inclusion was missed last quarter due to confusion about their PREVIOUS status as a SPAC. It is expected that they will be reconsidered for Russell Index inclusions in the yearly reconstitution. While not the biggest catalyst, this is a sign of reputation and long-term stability for the stock. **The prelim list publishes 6/4/2021.**
* Creation of a jumbo mortgage product. The average loan origination in the market is \~410,000, indicating that the non-conforming section of the mortgage market is *exploding.* This is a very profitable sector of loan origination.

Other fundamentals driving a buy recommendation:

* Small float. 90M float, of which only about 60M is freely trading.
* This stock is not persistently pressured down quite as hard as others due to low share availability, but it appears based on the last two weeks it's trading the small waves of this stock to try to push it down under dangerous strike prices. A wave of positive sentiment could strangle this position in the stock. I don't have a Bloomberg terminal, but based on the evidence over the last several days, the indication is the 13.1% SI has grown.
* Exceptional open option interest for **tomorrow 5/21/2021.** The options expiring tomorrow have been documented elsewhere so I won't belabor them, but the open interest at the $9, and $10 strike represent almost 10% of the free float.
* Not a new startup, **they have been in this business since 1986**, making them almost as old as a fossil like me. They clearly survived the 2008 storm. This company isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

The cherry:

* **STILL forecasting growth in Q2**, whereas many of its competitors are not.

This post is NOT financial advice, but as someone who has ridden the waves of this stock since it was about $9, I see this position turning positive and the outlook through July for this position has high sentiment. Even if the mortgage market slows down as expected, I will hold these shares for years to come for the dividends and general stability of the organization.

My position 8000 shares @ 7.65 and 45x 6/18 8c. You can go stalk the fuck out of me if you want to see that I've been talking about this stock for some time and been saying the same thing about the strength and targets of their position since March. I am also the guy that tells you when you unintentionally reveal personal info on your yolo screenshots!

TLDR: UWMC should garner close attention for value investors looking for undervalued positions.

3566,,2021-05-20 13:28:43,t3_nh08j4,,wallstreetbets,"**Investment Thesis**

Overall, what makes MDXG a good buying opportunity right now is a combination of two factors.

* Number one is management‚Äôs miscommunication with the market. The market currently believes that wound care is the core business of MDXG, is not entirely aware of the potential of its biopharma pipeline and more specifically its Amniofix drug, and has priced the company based on this.¬†
* Number two is the huge potential of the Amniofix treatment and its ability to become the next blockbuster in the healthcare space after the conclusion of its phase 3 trial.

**Idea Summary**

MiMedx Group *(MDXG)* is a leading BioPharma and wound care business whose value has been drastically misunderstood by the market. Through drivers such as miscommunication from management about the company‚Äôs valued proposition as well as the lack of institutional investor coverage, the market currently believes that the majority of the company‚Äôs value sits in its low growth wound care business. In reality, its major competitive advantage is within its osteoarthritis drug Amniofix which has the potential to become the next blockbuster after it clears phase III clinical trials. A sum of the parts valuation was used to determine a minimum implied upside of at least 300%. Risks are discussed at the end.

**Business Overview**

MiMedx Group is a leading biopharma and advanced wound care business utilizing human placental tissues to develop products used in the healthcare sector. It processes placental tissues using its patented processes to produce allografts, which are tissues transplanted from one person to another for wound care and regeneration. These allografts are effective in healing difficult wounds because of the ability of the allograft cells to quickly associate with the cells of the patient, thereby taking part in the healing process, easing the ability of the body to close the wound, and speeding up the body‚Äôs regeneration process.

MDXG‚Äôs product offerings can be split into two business segments: wound care and biopharma (surgical solutions). Its flagship product Epifix and additional product Epicord fall under its wound care umbrella, and its flagship product Amniofix as well as additional products Amniocord, Amniofill, and Epiburn fall under its biopharma umbrella. The wound care products service the broad wound care industry, targeting specifically chronic wounds. The biopharma product line is more specific, with the flagship treatment Amniofix targeting knee osteoarthritis in specific.¬†

MDXG sells through direct sales, sales agents, and distributors in the United States. This past quarter, 95% of its sales were direct to customers such as healthcare professionals and facilities.¬†

**Internal Analysis**

The past 3 years have not been ideal for MDXG. Its revenues began to dip in 2018 around the time of their accounting scandal, the growth went from 40% in 2018, to 11% in 2019, and is currently around -16%. This sent their stock price tumbling from $16 USD to lows of almost $1 USD, though it is currently trading at $9 with new updates on their biopharma pipeline.

Their gross margin has stayed very high, around 80% while their EBITDA margins have dropped over the years. Though it wasn‚Äôt explicitly disclosed, a large part of this drop in EBITDA margins has been attributed to a temporary increase in legal fees due to the litigation MDXG has faced this past year. Its decreased volume may have also suppressed margins as the number of wound care treatments in hospitals significantly dropped during COVID-19.¬†

The company‚Äôs cash balance is sitting at a very high level of 84 mm. This is in large part due to its recent capital raise, which happened to be strongly criticized by one of MDXG‚Äôs activist investors, Prescience Point Capital (discussed in detail later).

**External Analysis**

*Wound Care Market*

The global wound care market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% from 2021 to 2028. This has been driven by the aging population and rising rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Wound care products are increasingly being used to prevent and surgical site infections.¬†

Though the overall market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% the specific advanced product segment which includes products such as those of MDXG‚Äôs which target chronic and non-healing wounds, is projected to grow much faster than 4.1%.¬†

The wound care market is relatively fragmented, with large players such as Integra LifeSciences, 3M, Johnson & Johnson, and Medtronic competing to gain the most market share. MDXG‚Äôs direct competition for its allograft advanced wound care treatments include Organogenesis, Axogen, Mediwound, and Vericel.¬†

Organogenesis is currently in the lead in this niche market, and while MDXG reported an 11% YoY decline in sales in 2020 (which has already been factored into the current price), Organogenesis reported a 30% increase. This is evident when comparing the stock performance of both companies over the past year (figure 1)

*Osteoarthritis Therapy Market*

91 million U.S. adults have arthritis, 20M have knee OA, and \~32 million per year are currently treated for plantar fasciitis, which is specifically targeted by MDXG‚Äôs Amniofix drug. There are very few FDA approved treatments for knee OA and plantar fasciitis, and those that exist have low efficacy and many drawbacks. Amniofix is currently the only treatment of its nature in phase 3 clinical trials that have posted very positive results in both company and independent trials, has been used off-label by >100K patients with zero severe adverse effects, and consistently demonstrates a significant reduction in pain as reported by patients. In addition, Amniofix has an RMAT (regenerative medicine advanced therapy) designation granted by the FDA which allows for MDXG to benefit from an expedited approval process from the FDA.

*Management Miscommunication*

The current market opinion of MDXG has been blurred by the miscommunication from company management whose goals do not align with maximizing shareholder value. This is largely due to the fact that EW healthcare, a private equity firm, has 33% representation on the board as a result of its 17% stake. From a corporate finance perspective, a private equity firm‚Äôs interests do not generally tend to align with those of public shareholders. Their influence has been exacerbated by the fact that there are no large institutional holdings in MDXG as of yet other than Prescience Point, and there has been minimal coverage on the stock leading to the market‚Äôs opinion on the company being heavily skewed by management communications.¬†

MDXG‚Äôs current growth strategy is focused on roll-ups in the wound care space. This is very characteristic of a private equity playbook, and goes alongside EW‚Äôs historical acquisitions. As was mentioned in the external analysis, the wound care space is growing at a slow rate of \~4.1%, however MDXG has lost significant market share to Organogenesis. Management has failed to realize that the current value driver of the business is within its biopharma line and not its wound care line, yet has continually communicated to shareholders that it believes it is in fact wound care and it is going to continue investing in growing within the industry.

Prescience Point Capital, an activist investor group which has advocated for change in MDXG's communication strategy, has supported the fact that MDXG‚Äôs communications have been focused on the wrong industry. At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, the potential for the drug Amniofix was drastically undersold and much time was spent convincing investors that the core business is in wound care. The 3.6% decline in shares two days after the conference illustrates how effective this strategy was.¬†

There has been strong opposition from MDXG‚Äôs board of directors to Prescience Point‚Äôs activist efforts. In a shareholder letter in early May, prior to their annual meeting, the company communicated that they believe the wound care and regenerative medicine direction being followed now is ideal. They stated that the activist investor does not understand pharmaceutical company disclosure and were advocating for speculative actions themselves though Prescience‚Äôs report discusses the opposite, with them outlining how EW‚Äôs influence on the board of directors is shifting the company‚Äôs focus away from maximizing shareholder value.

*Amniofix*

As mentioned in the external analysis, there is currently no other treatment, either in development or on the market, as effective as Amniofix in treating knee OA and also just as safe. Most recently, at its Q1 earnings call, MDXG CEO shared positive results from the phase IIb prospective trial of the treatment. There was a statistically significant reduction in VAS (visual analog score) for pain and an improvement in the foot function index score. There were also no serious adverse events during this clinical trial. Amniofix is currently in phase III trials, and MDXG believes they are on target to meet all criteria needed to find a biologics license application (BLA) so that the treatment can be introduced to the general public. MDXG is aiming to file their BLA in the first half of 2022, meaning that within a year this blockbuster treatment could be on the market, and given the feedback so far from clinical trials as well as the RMAT designation, it is highly likely.

A Prescience Point market capture analysis estimated that the treatment would bring in $4,050 million of annual sales. This is \~8 times higher than the current sales brought in through wound care. One year ago it would have been prudent to not entirely incorporate this into the share price, however today with clinical trials nearing completion and MDXG‚Äôs new RMAT designation, the likelihood of approval is much higher.

**Valuation**

From a valuation point of view, a quick sum of the parts analysis is the most ideal given the two different business lines of MDXG. A more in-depth DCF can be created once more cost information is provided from MDXG after the conclusion of clinical trials.

Shares outstanding of 109.8 mm, total debt of 51.8 mm, and total cash of 84.7mm were used to convert from enterprise value to equity value. The current implied upside was calculated using the current price of $9.46.

*Wound Care Valuation*

MDXG‚Äôs FY 2021 sales guidance assumed $255 mm to $270 mm in revenue from the wound care segment. Different points in this revenue ranged were used for the low, base, and high cases of the valuation. An EV/Revenue multiple was used to calculate implied enterprise value. The comparables analysis shown in figure 2 illustrated the median multiples derived from the analysis done using the aforementioned list of MDXG‚Äôs competitors. A median multiple of 5.3x was used. The median was used and not marked down because the gross margin and UFCF yield of MDXG is in-line with all competitors. Though the EBIDTA multiple was lower, the similar yield and gross margins indicate that company performance is relatively the same. In addition, litigation expenses factored into the lower EBIDTA multiples and thus it is not indicative of recurring performance.

Based on the revenue multiples, implied share values for the wound care segment range between $12.0 and $12.8.

**Wound Care Equity Value**

**Biopharma Valuation**

Prescience Point estimated annual revenues from Amniofix through using the market capture method. The total market size (annual knee OA injections) was estimated, and a capture percentage was applied to determine the annual number of patients receiving the Amniofix injection. Prescience assumed 1.5 injections per year but to be more conservative in this valuation 1 was used. Price per injection and FDA approval probability varied by the cases and were used to adjust the EV/Rev multiple downwards. Overall, an implied share value range between $25.4 and $57.1 was calculated for this segment.

https://preview.redd.it/we0pw4jm1a071.png?width=611&format=png&auto=webp&s=567d19cc5acc59acbe552a2afcf09789c80866ff

**Biopharma Equity Value**

Overall, the total implied share price ranges between $37.43 to $69.81. As more information regarding Amniofix comes out including the price of manufacturing, different multiples can be used to fine-tune the analysis.

https://preview.redd.it/a8035yfo1a071.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=12e0f9a041e326b505bfda25304261367c651406

**Risks**

1. Given the high influence EW healthcare has on the board of directors, there is potential for more value to describe acquisitions such as that of stability biologics, which was bought for 10 million and sold for 3.5 million 3 years later. If such a trend continues, the value of MDXG‚Äôs wound care business can dramatically decrease, which will hurt the share pierce
2. The FDA approval of Amniofix is a large driver of the valuation calculated. There is a large risk that the FDA will not approve the treatment, however, with the RMAT designation in place and positive results from the first two phases of clinical trials, the odds are strongly in the favour of the approval at the current point in time.

Overall MDXG has been strongly misrepresented by management leading to a skewed opinion and pricing by the market.",nh08j4,$MDXG - Management Miscommunication Skews Valuation Down and Creates Great Buying Opportunity

For those who don't know, $EEM - or the iShares Emerging Markets ETF - is comprised of stocks from developing nations, with a **ton** of room to grow. These countries **will** all catch up soon, it's only a matter of time. This is one of the many reasons I find this setup especially interesting.

Here are the top holdings:

[$EEM Holdings \(By Country\)](https://preview.redd.it/zh7nwb2hfa071.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cb2749a2c7d6c7f548ad89a3f9a746b56d2273)

Next, let's dig into the charts -

Chart 1: **Max Monthly (\~16 Years)**

[$EEM Max Monthly](https://preview.redd.it/ylknrqzhea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=91ee9718b89c47744e6f68224a133c48c7bcfc6f)

Here you can see we have a **symmetrical triangle** pattern that dates back to late 2007. In technical analysis, the longer the pattern has been building, the more significant the breakout will be. Subsequently - you can imagine the magnitude a pattern like this has.

When making new all time highs I like to look for psychological resistances. As a result - logical targets for this pattern are **75.00, 100.00.** Sounds simple, but it works in practice. Keep in mind - something like this will take **3 - 5 years** to play out. This is a position trade.

In order for this breakout to stay valid - we need to continue getting monthly closes above **50.85.** You can see we've pretty much gone perfectly sideways since breaking out for **4 months** now.

This is **bullish -** moving sideways in a higher range is always biased to the upside (except in special situations with certain reversal patterns). Not only that, but we've been forming an interesting setup on the next chart I will show you all -

Chart 2: **1 Year 1 Day**

[$EEM 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/7hy7wbqeea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8102c5b1f0e92c02260cfccc6b8d77eafea8035d)

On this chart - you can make much more sense of those 4 months of sideways. We are actually working on a large **falling wedge** \- which is a bullish continuation pattern. The breakout point for this is sitting around **54.37** as I am writing this (5/20/2021).

Upon breaking this (ignoring the previous chart) - we would target **54.94, 56.49, 57.32, 60.00, 65.00.** That would be if there was no setup on the monthly chart. Each of these are resistances we could stop and consolidate at. I like to scale in after breaking each resistance. Scale into winners and cut losers fast. A break from a pattern like this would probably take **3 - 6 months** to play out.

I also want to note that **MASSIVE** increase in volume on 3/26. Generally - an uptick on volume when price is doing what you want it to is always a plus. But one like that is very intriguing - on a huge green candle too. My guess would be someone loaded their bags there (or a group of players).

And... **that's it.** Keep it simple. Those are often the best setups.

***TL;DR -***

$EEM has a big pattern - broke out 4 months ago just chopping sideways waiting for the move to happen.

Price targets **75.00, 100.00**

Stop out below **50.87** monthly close

Timeframe **3-5 years**

It also has a smaller pattern above that one - which breaks out above **54.37** and has a shorter time horizon.

Price targets **60.00, 65.00**

Stop out if we close back inside

Timeframe **3-6 months**

***Positions -***

10% of my long term portfolio is in emerging markets ETFs and,

August **55c @ 0.91** \- Will always roll these back before they get below 60 DTE - Will scale in heavily after the smaller pattern breaks out

\- Research coming out of John Hopkins University is suggesting that the use of Psilocybin is the most effective drug ever tested as a remedy for depression, anxiety, and PTSD. As the United States is currently under crisis in its battle against mental illness, these results are too impressive to ignore, even if it may need to overcome pressures from big pharma interest groups that seek to quell the expansion of this research.

\- These drugs have been extremely effective in treating addiction -- particularly alcohol and nicotine. Considering the government expenditure on the opioid crisis, once this proves to be an effective treatment, the government will expedite the medicinal legalization of the substances that MNMD has been treating/experimenting with.

\- Veterans, the most respected occupational category (statistically,) have begun launching advocacy groups for the widespread medicinal legalization of these substances due to their effectiveness against PTSD. These therapeutic measures have contributed to the plummeting of suicide rates (those treated w/ psilocybin vs. control group.) The Biden administration will have to choose ethics and reason over the suffering of veterans (former government employees) which I anticipate that they will given mounting pressure due to the effectiveness of these treatments.

Does this hinge on expected earnings in the long-run ... certainly!

&#x200B;

But the effectiveness of this research is undeniable and can no longer be overlooked ... because of new cultural acceptance of these alternative treatments the government's hand will be forced in legalize, or otherwise be responsible for mental illness and addiction -- all of which could be treated and cured.

If you aren't familiar with the efficient frontier, what it tries to find is the *mean-variance portfolio.* This type of model deals with portfolio management / optimization. In terms of the efficient frontier you are trying to find the best portfolio allocation weights that give you the best risk adjusted returns. 

**In simple words:** you give it stocks and it tells you the best percentage holdings

I recently built an app on some python code that does this sort of optimization. There is no programming required to use the app. When running the app it will give two portfolios, minimum variance, and maximized sharpe (same as mean-variance, mean-markowitz). Minimum variance will tell you the least riskiest holding strategy (green), and max sharpe will give you the best reward-for-risk holding (red). I call that portfolio *the-juice-is-worth-the-squeeze.* Here is a sample output.

I used around 100,000 simulations, and 10Y of adjusted close data. 

The reason why I bring this up is because it does two things. The first is that it promotes portfolio diversification, which I know is pretty uncommon here. Also it finds the most aggressive returns in terms of minimizing risk. If you have high returns and wonder why you returns are so much higher than standard investment funds its probably because you are here

#Topics of discussion:

* Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks

* WDC Fundamentals

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community.

A little bit about myself for context:

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/555339dhob071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42585b1cfe4cf1c85eab62b0cc01791f5321f1e2

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",nh8f2j,PUBM DD #1

3590,,2021-05-20 19:09:28,t3_nh8q8x,,wallstreetbets," So this is the first time I've ever played around with options and I'm probably doing it in a dumb way but get that's more fun for you guys to watch. I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

This is not financial advice but...

Now that Tellurian (TELL) has crossed the 1bln market cap, you are ready to find out about what has the potential to be your biggest play this year.

Tellurian is a stock that‚Äôs been rattled by short sellers, whom the chairman Charif Souki despises and he‚Äôs been pretty vocal about it. The stock price tumbled 60% as a result of aggressive shorting since February and it appeared that the company isn‚Äôt going anywhere. 

However, they have recently repaid most of their debt and are about to start construction of their Driftwood LNG project this summer. They are said to be announcing commercial agreements over the next few weeks which is where the best part comes in‚Ä¶

If you have a browse through the options chain (https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tell/option-chain) you will notice the ridiculous open interest on Jan 22 calls with a strike price of‚Ä¶ 15usd!

It appears that insiders know that big volume contracts are coming and are betting on huge moves with the stock price coming back to its former glory. 

Combined with a significant short volume this has the potential to be a very explosive stock over the coming months.

Position: 9750 shares at 2.44usd

But this isn‚Äôt the only strike that exists out there. The March 2020 RH crash didn‚Äôt even make sense according to their own customer communications. They mentioned their outage was due to ‚Äúvery high load‚Äù but it took more than 2 days to fix everything AND a week later they said it was due to upgrading all of their services to use a new communication protocol. 

1. That is inconsistent communication like they gave for the Jan 2021 fiasco
2. The timing was impeccable. In the end the ‚Äúcommunication protocol upgrade‚Äù is not related at all to high traffic. Theoretically this issue could‚Äôve happened any other time in the history of the company. But it had to be during the 2020 crash.
3. These guys have really good tech.

3706,gyvkd90,2021-05-20 22:12:52,t1_gyvkd90,t1_gyvi9zk,wallstreetbets,"That's not an accurate depiction of core inflation. Having low real wages with increased productivity does not mean deflation at all. In fact it means growth and It means the fed can print money continuously and not suffer from massive inflation. 

Over the last 10 years interest rates have been very low. QE was used widely. But did we see inflation go up massively? 

The answer is no. Becuase real wages were not increasing but productivity was.

There's a reason why energy and food are stripped by the federal reserve when they look at core inflation. It's becuase it is very volatile and it can go up and down.

Real wages on the other hand are sticky and tend to stay up when they go up which has a bigger impact on long term inflation. 

When you look at energy costs going up 15% compared to real costs its effect isn't as significant.  Especially considering that energy price can tumble very quickly. Take last year in April...energy costs were less than they were 15 years ago.

For fed policy they want to look at inflation that will have a long term impact. That would be real wages. And as you correctly pointed out they have not been going up since the 1970s. Hence inflation has not been an issue for the last 30 or so years and the fed has been able to employ loose monetary policy.  

Since 2008 the fed has been pumping money into the economy. Don't you find it strange that now all of a sudden inflation is becoming a hot topic? The reasons are many like have extreme deflation last year when the global economy shut down but more importantly its the effect that workers right now are in demand and real wages might go up. This is what scares the fed. Not food or energy fluctuations. 

You need to look at this from a long term economic point of view and not short term blips.",,

First thing I notice is that periods of high variance returns are not sustained and they look possibly isolated, although there minor spikes before each big one.

https://preview.redd.it/ln6677wul1071.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c72c82557c3045a9575d857189931a84a693c24

On the other hand it looks like medium variance and low variance are in a constant switch off. We can see the almost perfect inversion between low variance probabilities and medium.

https://preview.redd.it/eqnl6ctzl1071.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f75444f4a5a854e7d842bb7f212c378c442f928

Most of those high variance returns come from changes from low to high variance. 

https://preview.redd.it/awjv82x4m1071.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=840a93a87d1745f84d79964cc296b8b282ff4153

This shows that high variance returns are more like *surprises* in the market because they come from low variance returns, its not a gradual buildup.  

**QQQ results**

QQQ‚Äôs results are very similar to SPY‚Äôs results. 

https://preview.redd.it/bqavsxmam1071.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad8be59558f24274d2ac689fa83e8c7a629de55

It seems like there are not *precursor* spikes in high variance returns, and the occur in isolation.  In this case it does seem like there is a sustained period of high variance returns in the early 2000s.  

https://preview.redd.it/gp4sc5yem1071.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=73c238b2a8657a2ada87e458ebc27140654a352f

The same cyclical inverse pattern occurs within the low and medium level regimes.

https://preview.redd.it/qqkq714km1071.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=899816666e35168b5e1756ee58dba86013739f5c

And consistent with SPY it seems like high variance regime spikes come from low variance to high variance.

https://preview.redd.it/cb5o3v2om1071.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89f554112e2b8dd2d79904a6aa6249b3326a31a

**Conclusions / Future areas to investigate**

¬∑ In CBOE VIX data is was common for large spikes in high variance to come from medium variance regimes, that does not seem to be the case for SPY or QQQ most of the high variance spikes come from changes from low variance to high variance

¬∑ Both QQQ and SPY exhibited what look like to be an inverse relationship between low and medium variance regimes. Confirming results and possibly making indicators could be comparing covariances and trends between the time series and then if a there is a *shift* that is probably a *break* in the relationship which probably leads to a time of high variance

¬∑ QQQ did exhibit high variance regime for a longer sustained time and that may be because of its growth-orientation.

 I hope to turn the codebase into a python-only repo so I can analyze the time series in a notebook a publish more of my findings.

3807,,2021-05-19 15:44:46,t3_ng99i7,,wallstreetbets,"Been watching this Gold setup develop since last November. It's been in the making for just about 10 years now. 

[$GC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/dudwlorvi3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb931a041ddf4f5b79d58c008d4badcb8b91b7c2)

First - let's take a look at the **1 year 1 day** chart. Here - we are breaking what appears to just be a broadening descending wedge (a massive one). The breakout point was **1853 -** and it needs to hold **1848** to stay intact. 

You can see we already got some follow through here. Now, price targets/resistances are **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3.** 

Keep in mind - the larger the pattern, the larger the move, **the longer it takes to play out.** This isn't going to happen overnight. Timeframe to complete the move is **3-6 months** \- and we could form lots of smaller patterns in between.

Every time we cross one of those resistances, it should become a support. Also note that upon reaching them, it's likely we consolidate for a few days. Overall - a super clean setup, and a play I've been eyeing since March. 

Lastly, keep in mind - for a setup of this magnitude, you want the **weekly close** for confirmation.

But - what makes this really interesting is the **10 year 1 week chart.**

[$GC 10 Year 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/ejdwc9xvj3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bdfbd8e014548cda17aaf6e754e28cd9abf651f)

Here, we have an absolutely massive cup and handle dating back to 2011. In this context - the addition of this data mainly means we can look for a much higher price target on the wedge breakout. 

As a result - I'm targeting $GC **2250 - 2500** within the next **year.** Remember what I said about timeframes. This could take quite a while. For this setup to trigger - I'm looking for the **monthly close** above that first breakout point.

And... that's it. Remember, technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. Fake outs can and do happen. That's why we identify **key levels** to tell where we are within a setup. Take it step by step.

***TL;DR -*** 

$GC above 1853 weekly close targets **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3**

$GC above 1853 monthly close targets **2250, 2500**

I'm planning to continue doing weekly relative rotation analysis of the market, but wanted to create this mid week post to take a quick look at UWMC. Please let me know if another flair is more appropriate.

I'm not going to get into the financials, since plenty of solid DD has been done on that already. However, I did mention in my last post (analyzing the market sectors) that I would look into positions related to the real estate sector (XLRE).

My thought process here it to take a look at the short term momentum for this stock due to the recent positive earnings, great financials, positive future outlook, and upcoming June Ex-Div date.

Lets jump into it and make it quick...

Since there is a lot of talk regarding Russell inclusion, here is the RRG of UWMC again UWM:

**My Thoughts:**

Personally, the company has strong fundamentals. So, in combination with the momentum, I think its a decent ""buy"" (this is not professional financial advice).

I'm playing this 3 ways:

6/18 short put x 2 @ $7

7/16 long call x 5 @ $6

1100 shares @ $8.06

Edit 1: Silly me, I forgot to mention that a share buyback plan was approved which also contributes to the positive momentum.

I think that the increase size of her fund will continue to limit her ability to invest in anything interesting. The longshots in her portfolio which have had massive success are often successful because her fund's investment has massively increased their market cap.  She has also tied herself so tightly to Tesla that she can never hop off that ride. She's tied to the autopilot whether it goes to the moon or into a tree.

What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either. 

Here is some better and more thought out DD:

Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",ngftx1,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Mr. Cramer..."

I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made.

Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

3837,,2021-05-19 21:25:26,t3_nghmhm,,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",nghmhm,$NUE is strong as steel. Buy the dips.

Petco earnings is tomorrow pre-market. But this also might be a potential candidate for a short squeeze.

Short sellers are gearing up for a bad quarter. For the last three days, the short float increased from 4 point-something Monday, 6.05 yesterday, and today it's at 8.75.

In addition, short interest is up to 35.2%

To top it off, there are hardly any shares available to short, though borrowing rate remains at only 1%. For the last five days there were no more than 100k shares left to short.

3849,,2021-05-20 05:24:49,t3_ngrqqf,,wallstreetbets,"Some context: Cell carriers in the US have decided to stop the function of shared short codes (5-6 digit phone numbers) June 1. Shared short codes were the preferred means of SMS and MMS communication for B2C traffic. Short codes were free to lease in many cases, text messages were cheap, thousands of businesses could send from the same number, and throughput was incredibly high (lots of messages could be sent very fast).

The new policy enforced by the CTIA (The private club all major cell phone carriers are in) is that shared short codes are to be discontinued and replaced by dedicated short codes and A2P 10dlc (approved B2C traffic on 10-digit phone numbers). This means that every business/organization that wants to send texts must either apply for a dedicated short code or apply for a 10DLC. 

Dedicated short codes are the preferred choice for large corporations. They can handle large throughput and look good for the brand. However, they only cater to large corporations because they are thousands of dollars/year to lease. Turn around time for application is 4-6 weeks. Barrier to entry is high.

10DLC is the preferred choice for the smaller businesses since it's less expensive. But, it is still far more expensive than the shared short codes businesses are used to, requires application, and costs $50/mo in carrier and registration fees alone. Turn around time for application is less than a week. On top of fees, 10dlc isn't even fully ready. The Campaign Registry, the organization responsible for rolling out ""the new messaging standard"" for the CTIA, is still developing their API.

Enter Toll-free messaging. TF has 0 barrier to entry and can be issued to a business with SMS and MMS capabilities in seconds. It's the easiest and now the most cost-effective way to send commercial messages.

Conveniently, every major carrier announced this month (for the first time) that they will start collecting a $0.0025/message fee for every sms sent. They're ready for and expecting businesses to move to this method.

Who is Zipwhip: Zipwhip was given full reign over all TF traffic. Anyone in the US  that wants to send messages on TF codes uses Zipwhip in one way or another. They are a massive reseller that everyone is required to go through.

It was recently announced the Twilio plans on acquiring Zipwhip for $850M. Twilio is the leader is programmable messaging hands down. 

Honestly, there should be antitrust issues that arise and block the acquisition. If it goes through, Twilio owns the new world of business sms. Good chance regulators won't notice any issue. They'll miss the fact that businesses will be pressured into TF over their preferred solutions (dedicated short codes and A2P 10DLC) since it's unnecessarily complicated and expensive. TF is ready now and cheap.

TL;DR if Twilio successfully acquires Zipwhip, every small to medium sized business that wants to send texts will have to go through them. Every single one of them in the US.",ngrqqf,$TWLO stands to be the primary source for commercial text messaging

3852,,2021-05-20 08:25:07,t3_ngulnq,,wallstreetbets,"So just how big is **today's news about the initial success of the Sofusa technology**?

1st, this is a technology that aims at lymphatic delivery. 

**What does this mean?** Well, when trying to fight a disease, it's difficult to target the lymphatic system. Because of how it works and the fact that it is spread throughout our body. 

So there are MANY, MANY drugs out there that treat several conditions through the lymphatic system. But, because of what we just explained, those drugs sometimes don't work. They are not properly ""delivered"". They don't get to where they need to get to make the necessary interaction and solve the problem.

**Sorrento has developed a technology that can deliver drugs to where they actually need to go** in the lymphatic system. So this is definitely breakthrough technology. Other companies are aiming to find similar solutions. But we are definitely talking about very advanced bio-tech.

In this case, we have a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. This is a condition that worsens with time. It's very painful and limits the patient's movement. It's not very common, so we are talking about 1.5 million people in the USA and about 30 million worldwide. 

But remember, **the technology Sorrento is developing  will be able to deliver drugs treating many other diseases** related to the lymphatic system. So the market for Sofusa is very, very large.

The press release tells us Sofusa was tested on ""First Enbrel-Non-Responding"" patients. 

**What does this mean?** Patients who need the drug Enbrel and, even though they have not been taking the drug for long (it's a ""first"" for them) they are not responding to it. It isn't helping them. 

Now, Sofusa comes into play. It's job is to deliver Enbrel to the patient effectively. To ""take"" Enbrel to where it needs to go in the lymphatic system.. 

The 1st obvious advantage is that the drug wasn't helping and now helps. But there are other important advantages.

Since the drug is being carried to its targeted ""destination"" the dosage needed, diminishes. Because less is ""lost along the way"". This is important because many diseases related to the lymphatic system, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are chronic, lifelong conditions. Being able to administer less drugs really helps the patient. Now you have a drug that actually works, more potently, which reduces its dosage. All this thanks to Sorrento.

The press release points out an important factor: This is a trial on ONE type of drug/treatment. Other such trials testing the effectiveness of Sofusa are already taking place. Again, this is proof of the potentially huge market for this delivery system.

Just to get an idea, the release mentions anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. These are a type of drugs that inhibit the activity of certain proteins (they inhibit PD1 and CTLA4, which are types of proteins. By stopping their activity, they help in stopping the growth of cancer tumors). There are several drugs that fall under these categories and treat a wide variety of cancers. **Sofusa can potentially play a vital role in all these treatments**. 

This is like several companies developing apps while Sorrento is developing a new smartphone technology. Each app has its rightful use and market. But once the new smartphone is up and working, all apps will need it. So this technology has huge revenue implications. T**he fact we are hearing good news about it is HUGE**.

As for the results themselves: **The DAS28 test measures rheumatoid activity in 28 joints** in the patient's body. The joints might be swollen or tender (hurting).

This patient had a DAS28 score of 4.6, with 18 out of 28 joints compromised.  That is considered  moderate to high disease activity.  There are 4 levels of DAS 28 scores going from remission (the best) to high (the worst). So this patient was not in the worst shape going in, but pretty bad.

Using Sofusa to deliver the Enbrel drug, in just 4 weeks (this is a very short time for this type of disease!!) the results went from 4.6 to 3.0. The total amount of compromised joints, from 18 to 11. **That is a dramatic change**. The patient went from being somewhere between level 3 and 4, to being in the lower level 2, called ""low disease activity"", which indicates it's moving towards remission (the lowest level). For someone suffering from this condition, it's a real life changer. For the company selling Enbrel, it's a real market changer. And if it can equally help people with tumors, **Sofusa becomes a major therapeutic factor.** 

I hope investors understand this. **It's another major development in an already extremely promising pipeline** which is currently badly undervalued. If the price doesn't spike today by 10-15%, as it should, just from this news, it would be disappointing. 

But if you are long, today's price change isn't what matters the most. It‚Äôs the understanding that Sorrento / SRNE has ANOTHER ace in its hand!",ngulnq,How Big is SRNE news release about Sofusa success?

Any thoughts?",nguxep,"If SpaceX does revolutionize accessibility to Space, what companies stand to gain?"

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC and its +23% run in the past week. A stock with a massive dividend. A stock trading with a very low P/E of and income growth of 4,200%.

So why is this stock still a buy and hold for me right now?

The CEO is positioning them to increase shareholder value, but also position the company to weather any reduction in the refi market. (65% of the business)

There are major catalysts that have been driving the increase in price that goes beyond the attention gained on WSB.

* Announced **NET earnings of $860M in the first quarter,** with huge margins.
* Reaffirmed a continued dividend, the next ex-dividend date is **6/9/2021**.
* Announced a **$300M stock buyback, representing as much as 40% of the free float** at the current prices.
* Russell index inclusion was missed last quarter due to confusion about their PREVIOUS status as a SPAC. It is expected that they will be reconsidered for Russell Index inclusions in the yearly reconstitution. While not the biggest catalyst, this is a sign of reputation and long-term stability for the stock. **The prelim list publishes 6/4/2021.**
* Creation of a jumbo mortgage product. The average loan origination in the market is \~410,000, indicating that the non-conforming section of the mortgage market is *exploding.* This is a very profitable sector of loan origination.

Other fundamentals driving a buy recommendation:

* Small float. 90M float, of which only about 60M is freely trading.
* This stock is not persistently pressured down quite as hard as others due to low share availability, but it appears based on the last two weeks it's trading the small waves of this stock to try to push it down under dangerous strike prices. A wave of positive sentiment could strangle this position in the stock. I don't have a Bloomberg terminal, but based on the evidence over the last several days, the indication is the 13.1% SI has grown.
* Exceptional open option interest for **tomorrow 5/21/2021.** The options expiring tomorrow have been documented elsewhere so I won't belabor them, but the open interest at the $9, and $10 strike represent almost 10% of the free float.
* Not a new startup, **they have been in this business since 1986**, making them almost as old as a fossil like me. They clearly survived the 2008 storm. This company isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

The cherry:

* **STILL forecasting growth in Q2**, whereas many of its competitors are not.

This post is NOT financial advice, but as someone who has ridden the waves of this stock since it was about $9, I see this position turning positive and the outlook through July for this position has high sentiment. Even if the mortgage market slows down as expected, I will hold these shares for years to come for the dividends and general stability of the organization.

My position 8000 shares @ 7.65 and 45x 6/18 8c. You can go stalk the fuck out of me if you want to see that I've been talking about this stock for some time and been saying the same thing about the strength and targets of their position since March. I am also the guy that tells you when you unintentionally reveal personal info on your yolo screenshots!

TLDR: UWMC should garner close attention for value investors looking for undervalued positions.

3863,,2021-05-20 13:28:43,t3_nh08j4,,wallstreetbets,"**Investment Thesis**

Overall, what makes MDXG a good buying opportunity right now is a combination of two factors.

* Number one is management‚Äôs miscommunication with the market. The market currently believes that wound care is the core business of MDXG, is not entirely aware of the potential of its biopharma pipeline and more specifically its Amniofix drug, and has priced the company based on this.¬†
* Number two is the huge potential of the Amniofix treatment and its ability to become the next blockbuster in the healthcare space after the conclusion of its phase 3 trial.

**Idea Summary**

MiMedx Group *(MDXG)* is a leading BioPharma and wound care business whose value has been drastically misunderstood by the market. Through drivers such as miscommunication from management about the company‚Äôs valued proposition as well as the lack of institutional investor coverage, the market currently believes that the majority of the company‚Äôs value sits in its low growth wound care business. In reality, its major competitive advantage is within its osteoarthritis drug Amniofix which has the potential to become the next blockbuster after it clears phase III clinical trials. A sum of the parts valuation was used to determine a minimum implied upside of at least 300%. Risks are discussed at the end.

**Business Overview**

MiMedx Group is a leading biopharma and advanced wound care business utilizing human placental tissues to develop products used in the healthcare sector. It processes placental tissues using its patented processes to produce allografts, which are tissues transplanted from one person to another for wound care and regeneration. These allografts are effective in healing difficult wounds because of the ability of the allograft cells to quickly associate with the cells of the patient, thereby taking part in the healing process, easing the ability of the body to close the wound, and speeding up the body‚Äôs regeneration process.

MDXG‚Äôs product offerings can be split into two business segments: wound care and biopharma (surgical solutions). Its flagship product Epifix and additional product Epicord fall under its wound care umbrella, and its flagship product Amniofix as well as additional products Amniocord, Amniofill, and Epiburn fall under its biopharma umbrella. The wound care products service the broad wound care industry, targeting specifically chronic wounds. The biopharma product line is more specific, with the flagship treatment Amniofix targeting knee osteoarthritis in specific.¬†

MDXG sells through direct sales, sales agents, and distributors in the United States. This past quarter, 95% of its sales were direct to customers such as healthcare professionals and facilities.¬†

**Internal Analysis**

The past 3 years have not been ideal for MDXG. Its revenues began to dip in 2018 around the time of their accounting scandal, the growth went from 40% in 2018, to 11% in 2019, and is currently around -16%. This sent their stock price tumbling from $16 USD to lows of almost $1 USD, though it is currently trading at $9 with new updates on their biopharma pipeline.

Their gross margin has stayed very high, around 80% while their EBITDA margins have dropped over the years. Though it wasn‚Äôt explicitly disclosed, a large part of this drop in EBITDA margins has been attributed to a temporary increase in legal fees due to the litigation MDXG has faced this past year. Its decreased volume may have also suppressed margins as the number of wound care treatments in hospitals significantly dropped during COVID-19.¬†

The company‚Äôs cash balance is sitting at a very high level of 84 mm. This is in large part due to its recent capital raise, which happened to be strongly criticized by one of MDXG‚Äôs activist investors, Prescience Point Capital (discussed in detail later).

**External Analysis**

*Wound Care Market*

The global wound care market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% from 2021 to 2028. This has been driven by the aging population and rising rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Wound care products are increasingly being used to prevent and surgical site infections.¬†

Though the overall market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% the specific advanced product segment which includes products such as those of MDXG‚Äôs which target chronic and non-healing wounds, is projected to grow much faster than 4.1%.¬†

The wound care market is relatively fragmented, with large players such as Integra LifeSciences, 3M, Johnson & Johnson, and Medtronic competing to gain the most market share. MDXG‚Äôs direct competition for its allograft advanced wound care treatments include Organogenesis, Axogen, Mediwound, and Vericel.¬†

Organogenesis is currently in the lead in this niche market, and while MDXG reported an 11% YoY decline in sales in 2020 (which has already been factored into the current price), Organogenesis reported a 30% increase. This is evident when comparing the stock performance of both companies over the past year (figure 1)

*Osteoarthritis Therapy Market*

91 million U.S. adults have arthritis, 20M have knee OA, and \~32 million per year are currently treated for plantar fasciitis, which is specifically targeted by MDXG‚Äôs Amniofix drug. There are very few FDA approved treatments for knee OA and plantar fasciitis, and those that exist have low efficacy and many drawbacks. Amniofix is currently the only treatment of its nature in phase 3 clinical trials that have posted very positive results in both company and independent trials, has been used off-label by >100K patients with zero severe adverse effects, and consistently demonstrates a significant reduction in pain as reported by patients. In addition, Amniofix has an RMAT (regenerative medicine advanced therapy) designation granted by the FDA which allows for MDXG to benefit from an expedited approval process from the FDA.

*Management Miscommunication*

The current market opinion of MDXG has been blurred by the miscommunication from company management whose goals do not align with maximizing shareholder value. This is largely due to the fact that EW healthcare, a private equity firm, has 33% representation on the board as a result of its 17% stake. From a corporate finance perspective, a private equity firm‚Äôs interests do not generally tend to align with those of public shareholders. Their influence has been exacerbated by the fact that there are no large institutional holdings in MDXG as of yet other than Prescience Point, and there has been minimal coverage on the stock leading to the market‚Äôs opinion on the company being heavily skewed by management communications.¬†

MDXG‚Äôs current growth strategy is focused on roll-ups in the wound care space. This is very characteristic of a private equity playbook, and goes alongside EW‚Äôs historical acquisitions. As was mentioned in the external analysis, the wound care space is growing at a slow rate of \~4.1%, however MDXG has lost significant market share to Organogenesis. Management has failed to realize that the current value driver of the business is within its biopharma line and not its wound care line, yet has continually communicated to shareholders that it believes it is in fact wound care and it is going to continue investing in growing within the industry.

Prescience Point Capital, an activist investor group which has advocated for change in MDXG's communication strategy, has supported the fact that MDXG‚Äôs communications have been focused on the wrong industry. At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, the potential for the drug Amniofix was drastically undersold and much time was spent convincing investors that the core business is in wound care. The 3.6% decline in shares two days after the conference illustrates how effective this strategy was.¬†

There has been strong opposition from MDXG‚Äôs board of directors to Prescience Point‚Äôs activist efforts. In a shareholder letter in early May, prior to their annual meeting, the company communicated that they believe the wound care and regenerative medicine direction being followed now is ideal. They stated that the activist investor does not understand pharmaceutical company disclosure and were advocating for speculative actions themselves though Prescience‚Äôs report discusses the opposite, with them outlining how EW‚Äôs influence on the board of directors is shifting the company‚Äôs focus away from maximizing shareholder value.

*Amniofix*

As mentioned in the external analysis, there is currently no other treatment, either in development or on the market, as effective as Amniofix in treating knee OA and also just as safe. Most recently, at its Q1 earnings call, MDXG CEO shared positive results from the phase IIb prospective trial of the treatment. There was a statistically significant reduction in VAS (visual analog score) for pain and an improvement in the foot function index score. There were also no serious adverse events during this clinical trial. Amniofix is currently in phase III trials, and MDXG believes they are on target to meet all criteria needed to find a biologics license application (BLA) so that the treatment can be introduced to the general public. MDXG is aiming to file their BLA in the first half of 2022, meaning that within a year this blockbuster treatment could be on the market, and given the feedback so far from clinical trials as well as the RMAT designation, it is highly likely.

A Prescience Point market capture analysis estimated that the treatment would bring in $4,050 million of annual sales. This is \~8 times higher than the current sales brought in through wound care. One year ago it would have been prudent to not entirely incorporate this into the share price, however today with clinical trials nearing completion and MDXG‚Äôs new RMAT designation, the likelihood of approval is much higher.

**Valuation**

From a valuation point of view, a quick sum of the parts analysis is the most ideal given the two different business lines of MDXG. A more in-depth DCF can be created once more cost information is provided from MDXG after the conclusion of clinical trials.

Shares outstanding of 109.8 mm, total debt of 51.8 mm, and total cash of 84.7mm were used to convert from enterprise value to equity value. The current implied upside was calculated using the current price of $9.46.

*Wound Care Valuation*

MDXG‚Äôs FY 2021 sales guidance assumed $255 mm to $270 mm in revenue from the wound care segment. Different points in this revenue ranged were used for the low, base, and high cases of the valuation. An EV/Revenue multiple was used to calculate implied enterprise value. The comparables analysis shown in figure 2 illustrated the median multiples derived from the analysis done using the aforementioned list of MDXG‚Äôs competitors. A median multiple of 5.3x was used. The median was used and not marked down because the gross margin and UFCF yield of MDXG is in-line with all competitors. Though the EBIDTA multiple was lower, the similar yield and gross margins indicate that company performance is relatively the same. In addition, litigation expenses factored into the lower EBIDTA multiples and thus it is not indicative of recurring performance.

Based on the revenue multiples, implied share values for the wound care segment range between $12.0 and $12.8.

**Wound Care Equity Value**

https://preview.redd.it/dibh93jl1a071.png?width=549&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c1871e08591796daa0a434274332cd9a4353258

**Biopharma Valuation**

Prescience Point estimated annual revenues from Amniofix through using the market capture method. The total market size (annual knee OA injections) was estimated, and a capture percentage was applied to determine the annual number of patients receiving the Amniofix injection. Prescience assumed 1.5 injections per year but to be more conservative in this valuation 1 was used. Price per injection and FDA approval probability varied by the cases and were used to adjust the EV/Rev multiple downwards. Overall, an implied share value range between $25.4 and $57.1 was calculated for this segment.

https://preview.redd.it/we0pw4jm1a071.png?width=611&format=png&auto=webp&s=567d19cc5acc59acbe552a2afcf09789c80866ff

**Biopharma Equity Value**

Overall, the total implied share price ranges between $37.43 to $69.81. As more information regarding Amniofix comes out including the price of manufacturing, different multiples can be used to fine-tune the analysis.

https://preview.redd.it/a8035yfo1a071.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=12e0f9a041e326b505bfda25304261367c651406

**Risks**

1. Given the high influence EW healthcare has on the board of directors, there is potential for more value to describe acquisitions such as that of stability biologics, which was bought for 10 million and sold for 3.5 million 3 years later. If such a trend continues, the value of MDXG‚Äôs wound care business can dramatically decrease, which will hurt the share pierce
2. The FDA approval of Amniofix is a large driver of the valuation calculated. There is a large risk that the FDA will not approve the treatment, however, with the RMAT designation in place and positive results from the first two phases of clinical trials, the odds are strongly in the favour of the approval at the current point in time.

Overall MDXG has been strongly misrepresented by management leading to a skewed opinion and pricing by the market.",nh08j4,$MDXG - Management Miscommunication Skews Valuation Down and Creates Great Buying Opportunity

For those who don't know, $EEM - or the iShares Emerging Markets ETF - is comprised of stocks from developing nations, with a **ton** of room to grow. These countries **will** all catch up soon, it's only a matter of time. This is one of the many reasons I find this setup especially interesting.

Here are the top holdings:

[$EEM Holdings \(By Country\)](https://preview.redd.it/zh7nwb2hfa071.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cb2749a2c7d6c7f548ad89a3f9a746b56d2273)

Next, let's dig into the charts -

Chart 1: **Max Monthly (\~16 Years)**

[$EEM Max Monthly](https://preview.redd.it/ylknrqzhea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=91ee9718b89c47744e6f68224a133c48c7bcfc6f)

Here you can see we have a **symmetrical triangle** pattern that dates back to late 2007. In technical analysis, the longer the pattern has been building, the more significant the breakout will be. Subsequently - you can imagine the magnitude a pattern like this has.

When making new all time highs I like to look for psychological resistances. As a result - logical targets for this pattern are **75.00, 100.00.** Sounds simple, but it works in practice. Keep in mind - something like this will take **3 - 5 years** to play out. This is a position trade.

In order for this breakout to stay valid - we need to continue getting monthly closes above **50.85.** You can see we've pretty much gone perfectly sideways since breaking out for **4 months** now.

This is **bullish -** moving sideways in a higher range is always biased to the upside (except in special situations with certain reversal patterns). Not only that, but we've been forming an interesting setup on the next chart I will show you all -

Chart 2: **1 Year 1 Day**

[$EEM 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/7hy7wbqeea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8102c5b1f0e92c02260cfccc6b8d77eafea8035d)

On this chart - you can make much more sense of those 4 months of sideways. We are actually working on a large **falling wedge** \- which is a bullish continuation pattern. The breakout point for this is sitting around **54.37** as I am writing this (5/20/2021).

Upon breaking this (ignoring the previous chart) - we would target **54.94, 56.49, 57.32, 60.00, 65.00.** That would be if there was no setup on the monthly chart. Each of these are resistances we could stop and consolidate at. I like to scale in after breaking each resistance. Scale into winners and cut losers fast. A break from a pattern like this would probably take **3 - 6 months** to play out.

I also want to note that **MASSIVE** increase in volume on 3/26. Generally - an uptick on volume when price is doing what you want it to is always a plus. But one like that is very intriguing - on a huge green candle too. My guess would be someone loaded their bags there (or a group of players).

And... **that's it.** Keep it simple. Those are often the best setups.

***TL;DR -***

$EEM has a big pattern - broke out 4 months ago just chopping sideways waiting for the move to happen.

Price targets **75.00, 100.00**

Stop out below **50.87** monthly close

Timeframe **3-5 years**

It also has a smaller pattern above that one - which breaks out above **54.37** and has a shorter time horizon.

Price targets **60.00, 65.00**

Stop out if we close back inside

Timeframe **3-6 months**

***Positions -***

10% of my long term portfolio is in emerging markets ETFs and,

August **55c @ 0.91** \- Will always roll these back before they get below 60 DTE - Will scale in heavily after the smaller pattern breaks out

\- Research coming out of John Hopkins University is suggesting that the use of Psilocybin is the most effective drug ever tested as a remedy for depression, anxiety, and PTSD. As the United States is currently under crisis in its battle against mental illness, these results are too impressive to ignore, even if it may need to overcome pressures from big pharma interest groups that seek to quell the expansion of this research.

\- These drugs have been extremely effective in treating addiction -- particularly alcohol and nicotine. Considering the government expenditure on the opioid crisis, once this proves to be an effective treatment, the government will expedite the medicinal legalization of the substances that MNMD has been treating/experimenting with.

\- Veterans, the most respected occupational category (statistically,) have begun launching advocacy groups for the widespread medicinal legalization of these substances due to their effectiveness against PTSD. These therapeutic measures have contributed to the plummeting of suicide rates (those treated w/ psilocybin vs. control group.) The Biden administration will have to choose ethics and reason over the suffering of veterans (former government employees) which I anticipate that they will given mounting pressure due to the effectiveness of these treatments.

Does this hinge on expected earnings in the long-run ... certainly!

But the effectiveness of this research is undeniable and can no longer be overlooked ... because of new cultural acceptance of these alternative treatments the government's hand will be forced in legalize, or otherwise be responsible for mental illness and addiction -- all of which could be treated and cured.

If you aren't familiar with the efficient frontier, what it tries to find is the *mean-variance portfolio.* This type of model deals with portfolio management / optimization. In terms of the efficient frontier you are trying to find the best portfolio allocation weights that give you the best risk adjusted returns. 

**In simple words:** you give it stocks and it tells you the best percentage holdings

I recently built an app on some python code that does this sort of optimization. There is no programming required to use the app. When running the app it will give two portfolios, minimum variance, and maximized sharpe (same as mean-variance, mean-markowitz). Minimum variance will tell you the least riskiest holding strategy (green), and max sharpe will give you the best reward-for-risk holding (red). I call that portfolio *the-juice-is-worth-the-squeeze.* Here is a sample output.

I used around 100,000 simulations, and 10Y of adjusted close data. 

The reason why I bring this up is because it does two things. The first is that it promotes portfolio diversification, which I know is pretty uncommon here. Also it finds the most aggressive returns in terms of minimizing risk. If you have high returns and wonder why you returns are so much higher than standard investment funds its probably because you are here

#Topics of discussion:

* Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks

* WDC Fundamentals

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community.

A little bit about myself for context:

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/555339dhob071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42585b1cfe4cf1c85eab62b0cc01791f5321f1e2

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",nh8f2j,PUBM DD #1

3887,,2021-05-20 19:09:28,t3_nh8q8x,,wallstreetbets," So this is the first time I've ever played around with options and I'm probably doing it in a dumb way but get that's more fun for you guys to watch. I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

This is not financial advice but...

Now that Tellurian (TELL) has crossed the 1bln market cap, you are ready to find out about what has the potential to be your biggest play this year.

Tellurian is a stock that‚Äôs been rattled by short sellers, whom the chairman Charif Souki despises and he‚Äôs been pretty vocal about it. The stock price tumbled 60% as a result of aggressive shorting since February and it appeared that the company isn‚Äôt going anywhere. 

However, they have recently repaid most of their debt and are about to start construction of their Driftwood LNG project this summer. They are said to be announcing commercial agreements over the next few weeks which is where the best part comes in‚Ä¶

If you have a browse through the options chain (https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tell/option-chain) you will notice the ridiculous open interest on Jan 22 calls with a strike price of‚Ä¶ 15usd!

It appears that insiders know that big volume contracts are coming and are betting on huge moves with the stock price coming back to its former glory. 

Combined with a significant short volume this has the potential to be a very explosive stock over the coming months.

Position: 9750 shares at 2.44usd

But at the same time, houses in my neighborhood, which is typically a low-price volatility neighborhood, are going through the roof.

I've been casually looking up what's for sale, and we're back to selling beat down houses for all time highs again. Meaning, people will put all their money down on a beater, and then jack up their credit cards at HD and Lowe's, buying shit to upgrade their homes. At some point that consumer credit will dry up for those stretched thin, and it will all go sideways again.

I am seriously wondering how long it can last before people wake up. At the same time, I am the stability in my current relationship, so if I try to time the market and sell high to buy low in a year or so, I might undermine us both (she rents).

I think your timing is probably right. That's what I was feeling a couple months ago. It's also a psychological factor when you see your home value increase by 20% in a few months in a ""safe"" neighborhood.

To your point though, inflation helps stocks when it‚Äôs the market that‚Äôs inflating. This would be huge injections of capital which you can see from the feds balance sheets, and wealth inequality because rich people just put their money in the stock market. So there‚Äôs been tons of inflation in the stock market over the years. There hasn‚Äôt been as much inflation in real goods though cuz I mean how many more groceries are rich people who are getting the majority of the money in the economy gonna buy? 

This inflation that‚Äôs happening now is not getting parked in stocks, it‚Äôs actually being spent on clothes, food, gas, used cars etc. When those real goods increase in price, the value of stocks decreases which is why market has been freaking out over inflation for past couple months",,

All good!

Its a similar scenario to the whole stock up on TP and Gas thing, the '08 PTSD. Everyone experiences it on some level.

Buying the poorest form of a product at its peak pricing and then using good money to fix it up while it depreciates.  

CC interest, Mortgage interest,  etc - wont end well for most.

You're right tho, the massive increase gives me sell fomo lol

I think the only logical play is to time a refi vs a sale - but all in all just glad im not forced to buy in this market or rent for another 1-2 years lol",,

I'm planning to continue doing weekly relative rotation analysis of the market, but wanted to create this mid week post to take a quick look at UWMC. Please let me know if another flair is more appropriate.

I'm not going to get into the financials, since plenty of solid DD has been done on that already. However, I did mention in my last post (analyzing the market sectors) that I would look into positions related to the real estate sector (XLRE).

My thought process here it to take a look at the short term momentum for this stock due to the recent positive earnings, great financials, positive future outlook, and upcoming June Ex-Div date.

Lets jump into it and make it quick...

Since there is a lot of talk regarding Russell inclusion, here is the RRG of UWMC again UWM:

[Looks like we have strong short term momentum when compared to the Russell 2000](https://preview.redd.it/4jlcf06t74071.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=aaf27b245685d1ecf8e0d0d5937216f3d1ef719d)

Now for SPY:

Finally, XLRE:

[No surprise. Similar to SPY](https://preview.redd.it/azj0le6i84071.png?width=893&format=png&auto=webp&s=84491c3d259a601a72339f9a7f53a7dc1078e3a1)

**My Thoughts:**

Personally, the company has strong fundamentals. So, in combination with the momentum, I think its a decent ""buy"" (this is not professional financial advice).

I'm playing this 3 ways:

6/18 short put x 2 @ $7

7/16 long call x 5 @ $6

1100 shares @ $8.06

Edit 1: Silly me, I forgot to mention that a share buyback plan was approved which also contributes to the positive momentum.

**TL;DR: UWMC looks good. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ**",ngckdk,UWMC: Relative Rotation

As always, be careful.

The Secondary offering is non dilutive and was offered @ 30.00 per share. The sellers were day 1 investors (Coliseum Capital).

I think that the increase size of her fund will continue to limit her ability to invest in anything interesting. The longshots in her portfolio which have had massive success are often successful because her fund's investment has massively increased their market cap.  She has also tied herself so tightly to Tesla that she can never hop off that ride. She's tied to the autopilot whether it goes to the moon or into a tree.

What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either. 

Here is some better and more thought out DD:

5003,,2021-05-19 20:14:45,t3_ngftx1,,wallstreetbets,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",ngftx1,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Mr. Cramer..."

Big tech's earnings absolutely destroyed estimates but sell side thinks it's due to lock down and people will rely on tech less once things open up. It's a consistent pattern that all the gains made after earning erode overnight or in a few trading session as if the good earning did not happen.

5006,,2021-05-19 20:51:00,t3_nggpql,,wallstreetbets,"I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

5008,,2021-05-19 21:25:26,t3_nghmhm,,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",nghmhm,$NUE is strong as steel. Buy the dips.

Petco earnings is tomorrow pre-market. But this also might be a potential candidate for a short squeeze.

Short sellers are gearing up for a bad quarter. For the last three days, the short float increased from 4 point-something Monday, 6.05 yesterday, and today it's at 8.75.

In addition, short interest is up to 35.2%

To top it off, there are hardly any shares available to short, though borrowing rate remains at only 1%. For the last five days there were no more than 100k shares left to short.

The average price target is $28, but if earnings goes better than expected, this could be the catalyst for something significantly bigger. Listen to your pets' beckoning calls, and keep this on your watch list!

Two major catalysts are on the near horizon:

1) Earnings report on 5/24 AH: Confirmation of late Q3 production and disclosure of binding orders have a high probability of being announced.

2) Lordstown Week (June 21-25): Plant open house for tours, test drives, etc., and above all else, transparency.  This should alone should put the final nail in the shorts coffin.

5020,,2021-05-20 05:24:49,t3_ngrqqf,,wallstreetbets,"Some context: Cell carriers in the US have decided to stop the function of shared short codes (5-6 digit phone numbers) June 1. Shared short codes were the preferred means of SMS and MMS communication for B2C traffic. Short codes were free to lease in many cases, text messages were cheap, thousands of businesses could send from the same number, and throughput was incredibly high (lots of messages could be sent very fast).

The new policy enforced by the CTIA (The private club all major cell phone carriers are in) is that shared short codes are to be discontinued and replaced by dedicated short codes and A2P 10dlc (approved B2C traffic on 10-digit phone numbers). This means that every business/organization that wants to send texts must either apply for a dedicated short code or apply for a 10DLC. 

Dedicated short codes are the preferred choice for large corporations. They can handle large throughput and look good for the brand. However, they only cater to large corporations because they are thousands of dollars/year to lease. Turn around time for application is 4-6 weeks. Barrier to entry is high.

10DLC is the preferred choice for the smaller businesses since it's less expensive. But, it is still far more expensive than the shared short codes businesses are used to, requires application, and costs $50/mo in carrier and registration fees alone. Turn around time for application is less than a week. On top of fees, 10dlc isn't even fully ready. The Campaign Registry, the organization responsible for rolling out ""the new messaging standard"" for the CTIA, is still developing their API.

Enter Toll-free messaging. TF has 0 barrier to entry and can be issued to a business with SMS and MMS capabilities in seconds. It's the easiest and now the most cost-effective way to send commercial messages.

Conveniently, every major carrier announced this month (for the first time) that they will start collecting a $0.0025/message fee for every sms sent. They're ready for and expecting businesses to move to this method.

Who is Zipwhip: Zipwhip was given full reign over all TF traffic. Anyone in the US  that wants to send messages on TF codes uses Zipwhip in one way or another. They are a massive reseller that everyone is required to go through.

It was recently announced the Twilio plans on acquiring Zipwhip for $850M. Twilio is the leader is programmable messaging hands down. 

Honestly, there should be antitrust issues that arise and block the acquisition. If it goes through, Twilio owns the new world of business sms. Good chance regulators won't notice any issue. They'll miss the fact that businesses will be pressured into TF over their preferred solutions (dedicated short codes and A2P 10DLC) since it's unnecessarily complicated and expensive. TF is ready now and cheap.

TL;DR if Twilio successfully acquires Zipwhip, every small to medium sized business that wants to send texts will have to go through them. Every single one of them in the US.",ngrqqf,$TWLO stands to be the primary source for commercial text messaging

5023,,2021-05-20 08:25:07,t3_ngulnq,,wallstreetbets,"So just how big is **today's news about the initial success of the Sofusa technology**?

1st, this is a technology that aims at lymphatic delivery. 

**What does this mean?** Well, when trying to fight a disease, it's difficult to target the lymphatic system. Because of how it works and the fact that it is spread throughout our body. 

So there are MANY, MANY drugs out there that treat several conditions through the lymphatic system. But, because of what we just explained, those drugs sometimes don't work. They are not properly ""delivered"". They don't get to where they need to get to make the necessary interaction and solve the problem.

**Sorrento has developed a technology that can deliver drugs to where they actually need to go** in the lymphatic system. So this is definitely breakthrough technology. Other companies are aiming to find similar solutions. But we are definitely talking about very advanced bio-tech.

In this case, we have a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. This is a condition that worsens with time. It's very painful and limits the patient's movement. It's not very common, so we are talking about 1.5 million people in the USA and about 30 million worldwide. 

But remember, **the technology Sorrento is developing  will be able to deliver drugs treating many other diseases** related to the lymphatic system. So the market for Sofusa is very, very large.

The press release tells us Sofusa was tested on ""First Enbrel-Non-Responding"" patients. 

**What does this mean?** Patients who need the drug Enbrel and, even though they have not been taking the drug for long (it's a ""first"" for them) they are not responding to it. It isn't helping them. 

Now, Sofusa comes into play. It's job is to deliver Enbrel to the patient effectively. To ""take"" Enbrel to where it needs to go in the lymphatic system.. 

The 1st obvious advantage is that the drug wasn't helping and now helps. But there are other important advantages.

Since the drug is being carried to its targeted ""destination"" the dosage needed, diminishes. Because less is ""lost along the way"". This is important because many diseases related to the lymphatic system, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are chronic, lifelong conditions. Being able to administer less drugs really helps the patient. Now you have a drug that actually works, more potently, which reduces its dosage. All this thanks to Sorrento.

The press release points out an important factor: This is a trial on ONE type of drug/treatment. Other such trials testing the effectiveness of Sofusa are already taking place. Again, this is proof of the potentially huge market for this delivery system.

Just to get an idea, the release mentions anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. These are a type of drugs that inhibit the activity of certain proteins (they inhibit PD1 and CTLA4, which are types of proteins. By stopping their activity, they help in stopping the growth of cancer tumors). There are several drugs that fall under these categories and treat a wide variety of cancers. **Sofusa can potentially play a vital role in all these treatments**. 

This is like several companies developing apps while Sorrento is developing a new smartphone technology. Each app has its rightful use and market. But once the new smartphone is up and working, all apps will need it. So this technology has huge revenue implications. T**he fact we are hearing good news about it is HUGE**.

As for the results themselves: **The DAS28 test measures rheumatoid activity in 28 joints** in the patient's body. The joints might be swollen or tender (hurting).

This patient had a DAS28 score of 4.6, with 18 out of 28 joints compromised.  That is considered  moderate to high disease activity.  There are 4 levels of DAS 28 scores going from remission (the best) to high (the worst). So this patient was not in the worst shape going in, but pretty bad.

Using Sofusa to deliver the Enbrel drug, in just 4 weeks (this is a very short time for this type of disease!!) the results went from 4.6 to 3.0. The total amount of compromised joints, from 18 to 11. **That is a dramatic change**. The patient went from being somewhere between level 3 and 4, to being in the lower level 2, called ""low disease activity"", which indicates it's moving towards remission (the lowest level). For someone suffering from this condition, it's a real life changer. For the company selling Enbrel, it's a real market changer. And if it can equally help people with tumors, **Sofusa becomes a major therapeutic factor.** 

I hope investors understand this. **It's another major development in an already extremely promising pipeline** which is currently badly undervalued. If the price doesn't spike today by 10-15%, as it should, just from this news, it would be disappointing. 

But if you are long, today's price change isn't what matters the most. It‚Äôs the understanding that Sorrento / SRNE has ANOTHER ace in its hand!",ngulnq,How Big is SRNE news release about Sofusa success?

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC and its +23% run in the past week. A stock with a massive dividend. A stock trading with a very low P/E of and income growth of 4,200%.

So why is this stock still a buy and hold for me right now?

The CEO is positioning them to increase shareholder value, but also position the company to weather any reduction in the refi market. (65% of the business)

There are major catalysts that have been driving the increase in price that goes beyond the attention gained on WSB.

* Announced **NET earnings of $860M in the first quarter,** with huge margins.
* Reaffirmed a continued dividend, the next ex-dividend date is **6/9/2021**.
* Announced a **$300M stock buyback, representing as much as 40% of the free float** at the current prices.
* Russell index inclusion was missed last quarter due to confusion about their PREVIOUS status as a SPAC. It is expected that they will be reconsidered for Russell Index inclusions in the yearly reconstitution. While not the biggest catalyst, this is a sign of reputation and long-term stability for the stock. **The prelim list publishes 6/4/2021.**
* Creation of a jumbo mortgage product. The average loan origination in the market is \~410,000, indicating that the non-conforming section of the mortgage market is *exploding.* This is a very profitable sector of loan origination.

Other fundamentals driving a buy recommendation:

* Small float. 90M float, of which only about 60M is freely trading.
* This stock is not persistently pressured down quite as hard as others due to low share availability, but it appears based on the last two weeks it's trading the small waves of this stock to try to push it down under dangerous strike prices. A wave of positive sentiment could strangle this position in the stock. I don't have a Bloomberg terminal, but based on the evidence over the last several days, the indication is the 13.1% SI has grown.
* Exceptional open option interest for **tomorrow 5/21/2021.** The options expiring tomorrow have been documented elsewhere so I won't belabor them, but the open interest at the $9, and $10 strike represent almost 10% of the free float.
* Not a new startup, **they have been in this business since 1986**, making them almost as old as a fossil like me. They clearly survived the 2008 storm. This company isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

The cherry:

* **STILL forecasting growth in Q2**, whereas many of its competitors are not.

This post is NOT financial advice, but as someone who has ridden the waves of this stock since it was about $9, I see this position turning positive and the outlook through July for this position has high sentiment. Even if the mortgage market slows down as expected, I will hold these shares for years to come for the dividends and general stability of the organization.

My position 8000 shares @ 7.65 and 45x 6/18 8c. You can go stalk the fuck out of me if you want to see that I've been talking about this stock for some time and been saying the same thing about the strength and targets of their position since March. I am also the guy that tells you when you unintentionally reveal personal info on your yolo screenshots!

TLDR: UWMC should garner close attention for value investors looking for undervalued positions.

5034,,2021-05-20 13:28:43,t3_nh08j4,,wallstreetbets,"**Investment Thesis**

Overall, what makes MDXG a good buying opportunity right now is a combination of two factors.

* Number one is management‚Äôs miscommunication with the market. The market currently believes that wound care is the core business of MDXG, is not entirely aware of the potential of its biopharma pipeline and more specifically its Amniofix drug, and has priced the company based on this.¬†
* Number two is the huge potential of the Amniofix treatment and its ability to become the next blockbuster in the healthcare space after the conclusion of its phase 3 trial.

**Idea Summary**

MiMedx Group *(MDXG)* is a leading BioPharma and wound care business whose value has been drastically misunderstood by the market. Through drivers such as miscommunication from management about the company‚Äôs valued proposition as well as the lack of institutional investor coverage, the market currently believes that the majority of the company‚Äôs value sits in its low growth wound care business. In reality, its major competitive advantage is within its osteoarthritis drug Amniofix which has the potential to become the next blockbuster after it clears phase III clinical trials. A sum of the parts valuation was used to determine a minimum implied upside of at least 300%. Risks are discussed at the end.

**Business Overview**

MiMedx Group is a leading biopharma and advanced wound care business utilizing human placental tissues to develop products used in the healthcare sector. It processes placental tissues using its patented processes to produce allografts, which are tissues transplanted from one person to another for wound care and regeneration. These allografts are effective in healing difficult wounds because of the ability of the allograft cells to quickly associate with the cells of the patient, thereby taking part in the healing process, easing the ability of the body to close the wound, and speeding up the body‚Äôs regeneration process.

MDXG‚Äôs product offerings can be split into two business segments: wound care and biopharma (surgical solutions). Its flagship product Epifix and additional product Epicord fall under its wound care umbrella, and its flagship product Amniofix as well as additional products Amniocord, Amniofill, and Epiburn fall under its biopharma umbrella. The wound care products service the broad wound care industry, targeting specifically chronic wounds. The biopharma product line is more specific, with the flagship treatment Amniofix targeting knee osteoarthritis in specific.¬†

MDXG sells through direct sales, sales agents, and distributors in the United States. This past quarter, 95% of its sales were direct to customers such as healthcare professionals and facilities.¬†

**Internal Analysis**

The past 3 years have not been ideal for MDXG. Its revenues began to dip in 2018 around the time of their accounting scandal, the growth went from 40% in 2018, to 11% in 2019, and is currently around -16%. This sent their stock price tumbling from $16 USD to lows of almost $1 USD, though it is currently trading at $9 with new updates on their biopharma pipeline.

Their gross margin has stayed very high, around 80% while their EBITDA margins have dropped over the years. Though it wasn‚Äôt explicitly disclosed, a large part of this drop in EBITDA margins has been attributed to a temporary increase in legal fees due to the litigation MDXG has faced this past year. Its decreased volume may have also suppressed margins as the number of wound care treatments in hospitals significantly dropped during COVID-19.¬†

The company‚Äôs cash balance is sitting at a very high level of 84 mm. This is in large part due to its recent capital raise, which happened to be strongly criticized by one of MDXG‚Äôs activist investors, Prescience Point Capital (discussed in detail later).

**External Analysis**

*Wound Care Market*

The global wound care market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% from 2021 to 2028. This has been driven by the aging population and rising rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Wound care products are increasingly being used to prevent and surgical site infections.¬†

Though the overall market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% the specific advanced product segment which includes products such as those of MDXG‚Äôs which target chronic and non-healing wounds, is projected to grow much faster than 4.1%.¬†

The wound care market is relatively fragmented, with large players such as Integra LifeSciences, 3M, Johnson & Johnson, and Medtronic competing to gain the most market share. MDXG‚Äôs direct competition for its allograft advanced wound care treatments include Organogenesis, Axogen, Mediwound, and Vericel.¬†

Organogenesis is currently in the lead in this niche market, and while MDXG reported an 11% YoY decline in sales in 2020 (which has already been factored into the current price), Organogenesis reported a 30% increase. This is evident when comparing the stock performance of both companies over the past year (figure 1)

*Osteoarthritis Therapy Market*

91 million U.S. adults have arthritis, 20M have knee OA, and \~32 million per year are currently treated for plantar fasciitis, which is specifically targeted by MDXG‚Äôs Amniofix drug. There are very few FDA approved treatments for knee OA and plantar fasciitis, and those that exist have low efficacy and many drawbacks. Amniofix is currently the only treatment of its nature in phase 3 clinical trials that have posted very positive results in both company and independent trials, has been used off-label by >100K patients with zero severe adverse effects, and consistently demonstrates a significant reduction in pain as reported by patients. In addition, Amniofix has an RMAT (regenerative medicine advanced therapy) designation granted by the FDA which allows for MDXG to benefit from an expedited approval process from the FDA.

*Management Miscommunication*

The current market opinion of MDXG has been blurred by the miscommunication from company management whose goals do not align with maximizing shareholder value. This is largely due to the fact that EW healthcare, a private equity firm, has 33% representation on the board as a result of its 17% stake. From a corporate finance perspective, a private equity firm‚Äôs interests do not generally tend to align with those of public shareholders. Their influence has been exacerbated by the fact that there are no large institutional holdings in MDXG as of yet other than Prescience Point, and there has been minimal coverage on the stock leading to the market‚Äôs opinion on the company being heavily skewed by management communications.¬†

MDXG‚Äôs current growth strategy is focused on roll-ups in the wound care space. This is very characteristic of a private equity playbook, and goes alongside EW‚Äôs historical acquisitions. As was mentioned in the external analysis, the wound care space is growing at a slow rate of \~4.1%, however MDXG has lost significant market share to Organogenesis. Management has failed to realize that the current value driver of the business is within its biopharma line and not its wound care line, yet has continually communicated to shareholders that it believes it is in fact wound care and it is going to continue investing in growing within the industry.

Prescience Point Capital, an activist investor group which has advocated for change in MDXG's communication strategy, has supported the fact that MDXG‚Äôs communications have been focused on the wrong industry. At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, the potential for the drug Amniofix was drastically undersold and much time was spent convincing investors that the core business is in wound care. The 3.6% decline in shares two days after the conference illustrates how effective this strategy was.¬†

There has been strong opposition from MDXG‚Äôs board of directors to Prescience Point‚Äôs activist efforts. In a shareholder letter in early May, prior to their annual meeting, the company communicated that they believe the wound care and regenerative medicine direction being followed now is ideal. They stated that the activist investor does not understand pharmaceutical company disclosure and were advocating for speculative actions themselves though Prescience‚Äôs report discusses the opposite, with them outlining how EW‚Äôs influence on the board of directors is shifting the company‚Äôs focus away from maximizing shareholder value.

*Amniofix*

As mentioned in the external analysis, there is currently no other treatment, either in development or on the market, as effective as Amniofix in treating knee OA and also just as safe. Most recently, at its Q1 earnings call, MDXG CEO shared positive results from the phase IIb prospective trial of the treatment. There was a statistically significant reduction in VAS (visual analog score) for pain and an improvement in the foot function index score. There were also no serious adverse events during this clinical trial. Amniofix is currently in phase III trials, and MDXG believes they are on target to meet all criteria needed to find a biologics license application (BLA) so that the treatment can be introduced to the general public. MDXG is aiming to file their BLA in the first half of 2022, meaning that within a year this blockbuster treatment could be on the market, and given the feedback so far from clinical trials as well as the RMAT designation, it is highly likely.

A Prescience Point market capture analysis estimated that the treatment would bring in $4,050 million of annual sales. This is \~8 times higher than the current sales brought in through wound care. One year ago it would have been prudent to not entirely incorporate this into the share price, however today with clinical trials nearing completion and MDXG‚Äôs new RMAT designation, the likelihood of approval is much higher.

**Valuation**

From a valuation point of view, a quick sum of the parts analysis is the most ideal given the two different business lines of MDXG. A more in-depth DCF can be created once more cost information is provided from MDXG after the conclusion of clinical trials.

Shares outstanding of 109.8 mm, total debt of 51.8 mm, and total cash of 84.7mm were used to convert from enterprise value to equity value. The current implied upside was calculated using the current price of $9.46.

*Wound Care Valuation*

MDXG‚Äôs FY 2021 sales guidance assumed $255 mm to $270 mm in revenue from the wound care segment. Different points in this revenue ranged were used for the low, base, and high cases of the valuation. An EV/Revenue multiple was used to calculate implied enterprise value. The comparables analysis shown in figure 2 illustrated the median multiples derived from the analysis done using the aforementioned list of MDXG‚Äôs competitors. A median multiple of 5.3x was used. The median was used and not marked down because the gross margin and UFCF yield of MDXG is in-line with all competitors. Though the EBIDTA multiple was lower, the similar yield and gross margins indicate that company performance is relatively the same. In addition, litigation expenses factored into the lower EBIDTA multiples and thus it is not indicative of recurring performance.

Based on the revenue multiples, implied share values for the wound care segment range between $12.0 and $12.8.

**Wound Care Equity Value**

**Biopharma Valuation**

Prescience Point estimated annual revenues from Amniofix through using the market capture method. The total market size (annual knee OA injections) was estimated, and a capture percentage was applied to determine the annual number of patients receiving the Amniofix injection. Prescience assumed 1.5 injections per year but to be more conservative in this valuation 1 was used. Price per injection and FDA approval probability varied by the cases and were used to adjust the EV/Rev multiple downwards. Overall, an implied share value range between $25.4 and $57.1 was calculated for this segment.

https://preview.redd.it/we0pw4jm1a071.png?width=611&format=png&auto=webp&s=567d19cc5acc59acbe552a2afcf09789c80866ff

**Biopharma Equity Value**

Overall, the total implied share price ranges between $37.43 to $69.81. As more information regarding Amniofix comes out including the price of manufacturing, different multiples can be used to fine-tune the analysis.

https://preview.redd.it/a8035yfo1a071.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=12e0f9a041e326b505bfda25304261367c651406

**Risks**

1. Given the high influence EW healthcare has on the board of directors, there is potential for more value to describe acquisitions such as that of stability biologics, which was bought for 10 million and sold for 3.5 million 3 years later. If such a trend continues, the value of MDXG‚Äôs wound care business can dramatically decrease, which will hurt the share pierce
2. The FDA approval of Amniofix is a large driver of the valuation calculated. There is a large risk that the FDA will not approve the treatment, however, with the RMAT designation in place and positive results from the first two phases of clinical trials, the odds are strongly in the favour of the approval at the current point in time.

For those who don't know, $EEM - or the iShares Emerging Markets ETF - is comprised of stocks from developing nations, with a **ton** of room to grow. These countries **will** all catch up soon, it's only a matter of time. This is one of the many reasons I find this setup especially interesting.

Here are the top holdings:

[$EEM Holdings \(By Country\)](https://preview.redd.it/zh7nwb2hfa071.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cb2749a2c7d6c7f548ad89a3f9a746b56d2273)

Next, let's dig into the charts -

Chart 1: **Max Monthly (\~16 Years)**

[$EEM Max Monthly](https://preview.redd.it/ylknrqzhea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=91ee9718b89c47744e6f68224a133c48c7bcfc6f)

Here you can see we have a **symmetrical triangle** pattern that dates back to late 2007. In technical analysis, the longer the pattern has been building, the more significant the breakout will be. Subsequently - you can imagine the magnitude a pattern like this has.

When making new all time highs I like to look for psychological resistances. As a result - logical targets for this pattern are **75.00, 100.00.** Sounds simple, but it works in practice. Keep in mind - something like this will take **3 - 5 years** to play out. This is a position trade.

In order for this breakout to stay valid - we need to continue getting monthly closes above **50.85.** You can see we've pretty much gone perfectly sideways since breaking out for **4 months** now.

This is **bullish -** moving sideways in a higher range is always biased to the upside (except in special situations with certain reversal patterns). Not only that, but we've been forming an interesting setup on the next chart I will show you all -

Chart 2: **1 Year 1 Day**

[$EEM 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/7hy7wbqeea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8102c5b1f0e92c02260cfccc6b8d77eafea8035d)

On this chart - you can make much more sense of those 4 months of sideways. We are actually working on a large **falling wedge** \- which is a bullish continuation pattern. The breakout point for this is sitting around **54.37** as I am writing this (5/20/2021).

Upon breaking this (ignoring the previous chart) - we would target **54.94, 56.49, 57.32, 60.00, 65.00.** That would be if there was no setup on the monthly chart. Each of these are resistances we could stop and consolidate at. I like to scale in after breaking each resistance. Scale into winners and cut losers fast. A break from a pattern like this would probably take **3 - 6 months** to play out.

I also want to note that **MASSIVE** increase in volume on 3/26. Generally - an uptick on volume when price is doing what you want it to is always a plus. But one like that is very intriguing - on a huge green candle too. My guess would be someone loaded their bags there (or a group of players).

And... **that's it.** Keep it simple. Those are often the best setups.

***TL;DR -***

$EEM has a big pattern - broke out 4 months ago just chopping sideways waiting for the move to happen.

Price targets **75.00, 100.00**

Stop out below **50.87** monthly close

Timeframe **3-5 years**

It also has a smaller pattern above that one - which breaks out above **54.37** and has a shorter time horizon.

Price targets **60.00, 65.00**

Stop out if we close back inside

Timeframe **3-6 months**

***Positions -***

10% of my long term portfolio is in emerging markets ETFs and,

August **55c @ 0.91** \- Will always roll these back before they get below 60 DTE - Will scale in heavily after the smaller pattern breaks out

\- Research coming out of John Hopkins University is suggesting that the use of Psilocybin is the most effective drug ever tested as a remedy for depression, anxiety, and PTSD. As the United States is currently under crisis in its battle against mental illness, these results are too impressive to ignore, even if it may need to overcome pressures from big pharma interest groups that seek to quell the expansion of this research.

\- These drugs have been extremely effective in treating addiction -- particularly alcohol and nicotine. Considering the government expenditure on the opioid crisis, once this proves to be an effective treatment, the government will expedite the medicinal legalization of the substances that MNMD has been treating/experimenting with.

\- Veterans, the most respected occupational category (statistically,) have begun launching advocacy groups for the widespread medicinal legalization of these substances due to their effectiveness against PTSD. These therapeutic measures have contributed to the plummeting of suicide rates (those treated w/ psilocybin vs. control group.) The Biden administration will have to choose ethics and reason over the suffering of veterans (former government employees) which I anticipate that they will given mounting pressure due to the effectiveness of these treatments.

&#x200B;

Does this hinge on expected earnings in the long-run ... certainly!

&#x200B;

But the effectiveness of this research is undeniable and can no longer be overlooked ... because of new cultural acceptance of these alternative treatments the government's hand will be forced in legalize, or otherwise be responsible for mental illness and addiction -- all of which could be treated and cured.

If you aren't familiar with the efficient frontier, what it tries to find is the *mean-variance portfolio.* This type of model deals with portfolio management / optimization. In terms of the efficient frontier you are trying to find the best portfolio allocation weights that give you the best risk adjusted returns. 

**In simple words:** you give it stocks and it tells you the best percentage holdings

I recently built an app on some python code that does this sort of optimization. There is no programming required to use the app. When running the app it will give two portfolios, minimum variance, and maximized sharpe (same as mean-variance, mean-markowitz). Minimum variance will tell you the least riskiest holding strategy (green), and max sharpe will give you the best reward-for-risk holding (red). I call that portfolio *the-juice-is-worth-the-squeeze.* Here is a sample output.

I used around 100,000 simulations, and 10Y of adjusted close data. 

The reason why I bring this up is because it does two things. The first is that it promotes portfolio diversification, which I know is pretty uncommon here. Also it finds the most aggressive returns in terms of minimizing risk. If you have high returns and wonder why you returns are so much higher than standard investment funds its probably because you are here

So if the test flight actually happens on the 22nd, then could be really big boom. Currently the price is around 18-19 bucks, so it's an absolute steal in my opinion, but there is always the risk that some shit fucks up and the test flight is delayed even further, in which case I will have to sell the house.

And before any of you autistic fucks say that SpaceX is better, just keep in mind that Virgin Galactic is playing a whole different game. SpaceX is trying to go to Mars, and Virgin Galactic is just trying to do some space tourism. Also keep in mind that Virgin Galactic was founded 2 whole years after SpaceX, so SpaceX has had a bit of a head start.

In this post I'm going to not talk about some kind of currency that can get this post removed. Hint: it crashed big time yesterday. You know the one.

There is a new kind of this currency that uses a lot of computer storage space. How much? Well - 7 EXABYTES and it's currently adding 1 exabyte every 3 days. I'm going to assume you know about this currency and if not you can look through my post history and see which subreddit I've posted to recently involving this particular one.

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

I believe the technology will allow for a more personal approach in the field of medicine, and should not be viewed solely as a research-based company.  

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community.

A little bit about myself for context:

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/555339dhob071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42585b1cfe4cf1c85eab62b0cc01791f5321f1e2

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",nh8f2j,PUBM DD #1

5058,,2021-05-20 19:09:28,t3_nh8q8x,,wallstreetbets," So this is the first time I've ever played around with options and I'm probably doing it in a dumb way but get that's more fun for you guys to watch. I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

Tellurian is a stock that‚Äôs been rattled by short sellers, whom the chairman Charif Souki despises and he‚Äôs been pretty vocal about it. The stock price tumbled 60% as a result of aggressive shorting since February and it appeared that the company isn‚Äôt going anywhere. 

However, they have recently repaid most of their debt and are about to start construction of their Driftwood LNG project this summer. They are said to be announcing commercial agreements over the next few weeks which is where the best part comes in‚Ä¶

If you have a browse through the options chain (https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tell/option-chain) you will notice the ridiculous open interest on Jan 22 calls with a strike price of‚Ä¶ 15usd!

It appears that insiders know that big volume contracts are coming and are betting on huge moves with the stock price coming back to its former glory. 

Combined with a significant short volume this has the potential to be a very explosive stock over the coming months.

My thesis:

* The dollar will continue to dump lower
* Fed will be backed into a corner needing to raise interest rates (bad for gold) to tame inflation, but won't be able to, because it would crash the market (they've tried in the past). So they'll need to do 'Yield Curve Control' (YCC is crazy shit, artificially capping rates) which is great for gold.
* I predict Gold will hit $2,600+ by EOY, which I believe will rocket all companies with the word ""GOLD"" in them.

Why SGNv?

Nokia Stock Forecast: $10 by 2025

By [MIKE STENGER](https://moneymorning.com/author/mstenger/), Associate Editor, *Money Morning* ‚Ä¢ May 20, 2021

Nokia stock has waited in the bullpen for years. Now, it may finally get the catalyst needed for a triple-digit rage. The Nokia stock forecast for 2025 is $10, more than double what it is today.

And this is happening sooner than later‚Ä¶

The Finnish telecom fell with the best of them in the 2020 COVID-19 crash, down near $3. Its growth couldn't match the broad market rally in the months that followed, though it did regain some footing in the $5 range.

üì∑

Nokia almost hit $7 when the Robinhood craze came about in January 2021. Those were levels unseen in the last decade.

Well, it's about to do it again. And this time, it's going even further.

Nokia was also one of the ""meme stocks"" making headlines alongside GameStop Corp. (NYSE: [GME](https://moneymorning.websol.barchart.com/?module=symbolSearch&override=1&symbol=GME)) and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (NYSE: [AMC](https://moneymorning.websol.barchart.com/?module=symbolSearch&override=1&symbol=AMC)). Hedge funds that were short on the stock were put in a difficult ""squeeze"" position where they had to buy back shares for more than they sold them.

However, some traders were unable to buy in as Nokia was among the stocks for which Robinhood controversially paused trading.

Now that the hype has mostly faded, we still have a solid $4.91 Nokia stock price, steadily climbing toward the previous $5 analyst target.

Two big market stories will move the Nokia stock price over the next decade. The rise of the Robinhood trader will continue to play a role. And 5G will start to show the results we've all been waiting for.

But one could make it a buy immediately.

Nokia's 5G Is Catching On

Probably the biggest driver of the Nokia stock price is future 5G hopes. According to ***Allied Market Research***, the 5G market could rise to $667 billion by 2026, which will have been a 1,526% rise from its 2020 value. Nokia could gain a significant portion of that.

We said in our 2021 Nokia stock forecast that the company would have to edge out a few of its global competitors to do this ‚Äì China's Huawei and Sweden's Ericsson.

While both companies are larger than Nokia, it looks like Nokia stands a chance against them both, as predicted in our 2021 Nokia stock price prediction.",nhdgyk,Very conservative outlook for NOK

5078,,2021-05-20 22:42:55,t3_nhdnzi,,wallstreetbets,"The cruise line industry has been nearly brought to extinction during the pandemic, but with the vaccines being distributed, cruise lines are making a major comeback. 
This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let‚Äôs go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don‚Äôt need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there‚Äôs a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

I'm planning to continue doing weekly relative rotation analysis of the market, but wanted to create this mid week post to take a quick look at UWMC. Please let me know if another flair is more appropriate.

I'm not going to get into the financials, since plenty of solid DD has been done on that already. However, I did mention in my last post (analyzing the market sectors) that I would look into positions related to the real estate sector (XLRE).

My thought process here it to take a look at the short term momentum for this stock due to the recent positive earnings, great financials, positive future outlook, and upcoming June Ex-Div date.

Lets jump into it and make it quick...

Since there is a lot of talk regarding Russell inclusion, here is the RRG of UWMC again UWM:

Finally, XLRE:

**My Thoughts:**

Personally, the company has strong fundamentals. So, in combination with the momentum, I think its a decent ""buy"" (this is not professional financial advice).

I'm playing this 3 ways:

6/18 short put x 2 @ $7

7/16 long call x 5 @ $6

1100 shares @ $8.06

Edit 1: Silly me, I forgot to mention that a share buyback plan was approved which also contributes to the positive momentum.

From the minute I heard the interview I realized that this person had no clue what she was talking about. To the credit of the Podcast hosts they mentioned that ARKK would have issues with outflows leading to lower stock prices in a later Podcast, which they have. I should have shorted it, but I'm not rich. Here are some of her stances:

She predicts CoinBit $500,000.

She is all-in on Tesla.

She thinks gene editing is a sound investment at this time.

She has decreased her position in Netflix.

I think that the increase size of her fund will continue to limit her ability to invest in anything interesting. The longshots in her portfolio which have had massive success are often successful because her fund's investment has massively increased their market cap.  She has also tied herself so tightly to Tesla that she can never hop off that ride. She's tied to the autopilot whether it goes to the moon or into a tree. I'm not denying that she has had good results during this bull market, but I think a fund that goes the other direction will do very well over the next 5 years.

What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either. 

Here is some better and more thought out DD:

Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",ngftx1,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Mr. Cramer..."

I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

5348,,2021-05-19 21:25:26,t3_nghmhm,,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",nghmhm,$NUE is strong as steel. Buy the dips.

Petco earnings is tomorrow pre-market. But this also might be a potential candidate for a short squeeze.

Short sellers are gearing up for a bad quarter. For the last three days, the short float increased from 4 point-something Monday, 6.05 yesterday, and today it's at 8.75.

In addition, short interest is up to 35.2%

To top it off, there are hardly any shares available to short, though borrowing rate remains at only 1%. For the last five days there were no more than 100k shares left to short.

The average price target is $28, but if earnings goes better than expected, this could be the catalyst for something significantly bigger. Listen to your pets' beckoning calls, and keep this on your watch list!

5360,,2021-05-20 05:24:49,t3_ngrqqf,,wallstreetbets,"Some context: Cell carriers in the US have decided to stop the function of shared short codes (5-6 digit phone numbers) June 1. Shared short codes were the preferred means of SMS and MMS communication for B2C traffic. Short codes were free to lease in many cases, text messages were cheap, thousands of businesses could send from the same number, and throughput was incredibly high (lots of messages could be sent very fast).

The new policy enforced by the CTIA (The private club all major cell phone carriers are in) is that shared short codes are to be discontinued and replaced by dedicated short codes and A2P 10dlc (approved B2C traffic on 10-digit phone numbers). This means that every business/organization that wants to send texts must either apply for a dedicated short code or apply for a 10DLC. 

Dedicated short codes are the preferred choice for large corporations. They can handle large throughput and look good for the brand. However, they only cater to large corporations because they are thousands of dollars/year to lease. Turn around time for application is 4-6 weeks. Barrier to entry is high.

10DLC is the preferred choice for the smaller businesses since it's less expensive. But, it is still far more expensive than the shared short codes businesses are used to, requires application, and costs $50/mo in carrier and registration fees alone. Turn around time for application is less than a week. On top of fees, 10dlc isn't even fully ready. The Campaign Registry, the organization responsible for rolling out ""the new messaging standard"" for the CTIA, is still developing their API.

Enter Toll-free messaging. TF has 0 barrier to entry and can be issued to a business with SMS and MMS capabilities in seconds. It's the easiest and now the most cost-effective way to send commercial messages.

Conveniently, every major carrier announced this month (for the first time) that they will start collecting a $0.0025/message fee for every sms sent. They're ready for and expecting businesses to move to this method.

Who is Zipwhip: Zipwhip was given full reign over all TF traffic. Anyone in the US  that wants to send messages on TF codes uses Zipwhip in one way or another. They are a massive reseller that everyone is required to go through.

It was recently announced the Twilio plans on acquiring Zipwhip for $850M. Twilio is the leader is programmable messaging hands down. 

Honestly, there should be antitrust issues that arise and block the acquisition. If it goes through, Twilio owns the new world of business sms. Good chance regulators won't notice any issue. They'll miss the fact that businesses will be pressured into TF over their preferred solutions (dedicated short codes and A2P 10DLC) since it's unnecessarily complicated and expensive. TF is ready now and cheap.

TL;DR if Twilio successfully acquires Zipwhip, every small to medium sized business that wants to send texts will have to go through them. Every single one of them in the US.",ngrqqf,$TWLO stands to be the primary source for commercial text messaging

5363,,2021-05-20 08:25:07,t3_ngulnq,,wallstreetbets,"So just how big is **today's news about the initial success of the Sofusa technology**?

1st, this is a technology that aims at lymphatic delivery. 

**What does this mean?** Well, when trying to fight a disease, it's difficult to target the lymphatic system. Because of how it works and the fact that it is spread throughout our body. 

So there are MANY, MANY drugs out there that treat several conditions through the lymphatic system. But, because of what we just explained, those drugs sometimes don't work. They are not properly ""delivered"". They don't get to where they need to get to make the necessary interaction and solve the problem.

**Sorrento has developed a technology that can deliver drugs to where they actually need to go** in the lymphatic system. So this is definitely breakthrough technology. Other companies are aiming to find similar solutions. But we are definitely talking about very advanced bio-tech.

In this case, we have a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. This is a condition that worsens with time. It's very painful and limits the patient's movement. It's not very common, so we are talking about 1.5 million people in the USA and about 30 million worldwide. 

But remember, **the technology Sorrento is developing  will be able to deliver drugs treating many other diseases** related to the lymphatic system. So the market for Sofusa is very, very large.

The press release tells us Sofusa was tested on ""First Enbrel-Non-Responding"" patients. 

**What does this mean?** Patients who need the drug Enbrel and, even though they have not been taking the drug for long (it's a ""first"" for them) they are not responding to it. It isn't helping them. 

Now, Sofusa comes into play. It's job is to deliver Enbrel to the patient effectively. To ""take"" Enbrel to where it needs to go in the lymphatic system.. 

The 1st obvious advantage is that the drug wasn't helping and now helps. But there are other important advantages.

Since the drug is being carried to its targeted ""destination"" the dosage needed, diminishes. Because less is ""lost along the way"". This is important because many diseases related to the lymphatic system, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are chronic, lifelong conditions. Being able to administer less drugs really helps the patient. Now you have a drug that actually works, more potently, which reduces its dosage. All this thanks to Sorrento.

The press release points out an important factor: This is a trial on ONE type of drug/treatment. Other such trials testing the effectiveness of Sofusa are already taking place. Again, this is proof of the potentially huge market for this delivery system.

Just to get an idea, the release mentions anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. These are a type of drugs that inhibit the activity of certain proteins (they inhibit PD1 and CTLA4, which are types of proteins. By stopping their activity, they help in stopping the growth of cancer tumors). There are several drugs that fall under these categories and treat a wide variety of cancers. **Sofusa can potentially play a vital role in all these treatments**. 

This is like several companies developing apps while Sorrento is developing a new smartphone technology. Each app has its rightful use and market. But once the new smartphone is up and working, all apps will need it. So this technology has huge revenue implications. T**he fact we are hearing good news about it is HUGE**.

As for the results themselves: **The DAS28 test measures rheumatoid activity in 28 joints** in the patient's body. The joints might be swollen or tender (hurting).

This patient had a DAS28 score of 4.6, with 18 out of 28 joints compromised.  That is considered  moderate to high disease activity.  There are 4 levels of DAS 28 scores going from remission (the best) to high (the worst). So this patient was not in the worst shape going in, but pretty bad.

Using Sofusa to deliver the Enbrel drug, in just 4 weeks (this is a very short time for this type of disease!!) the results went from 4.6 to 3.0. The total amount of compromised joints, from 18 to 11. **That is a dramatic change**. The patient went from being somewhere between level 3 and 4, to being in the lower level 2, called ""low disease activity"", which indicates it's moving towards remission (the lowest level). For someone suffering from this condition, it's a real life changer. For the company selling Enbrel, it's a real market changer. And if it can equally help people with tumors, **Sofusa becomes a major therapeutic factor.** 

I hope investors understand this. **It's another major development in an already extremely promising pipeline** which is currently badly undervalued. If the price doesn't spike today by 10-15%, as it should, just from this news, it would be disappointing. 

But if you are long, today's price change isn't what matters the most. It‚Äôs the understanding that Sorrento / SRNE has ANOTHER ace in its hand!",ngulnq,How Big is SRNE news release about Sofusa success?

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC and its +23% run in the past week. A stock with a massive dividend. A stock trading with a very low P/E of and income growth of 4,200%.

So why is this stock still a buy and hold for me right now?

The CEO is positioning them to increase shareholder value, but also position the company to weather any reduction in the refi market. (65% of the business)

There are major catalysts that have been driving the increase in price that goes beyond the attention gained on WSB.

* Announced **NET earnings of $860M in the first quarter,** with huge margins.
* Reaffirmed a continued dividend, the next ex-dividend date is **6/9/2021**.
* Announced a **$300M stock buyback, representing as much as 40% of the free float** at the current prices.
* Russell index inclusion was missed last quarter due to confusion about their PREVIOUS status as a SPAC. It is expected that they will be reconsidered for Russell Index inclusions in the yearly reconstitution. While not the biggest catalyst, this is a sign of reputation and long-term stability for the stock. **The prelim list publishes 6/4/2021.**
* Creation of a jumbo mortgage product. The average loan origination in the market is \~410,000, indicating that the non-conforming section of the mortgage market is *exploding.* This is a very profitable sector of loan origination.

Other fundamentals driving a buy recommendation:

* Small float. 90M float, of which only about 60M is freely trading.
* This stock is not persistently pressured down quite as hard as others due to low share availability, but it appears based on the last two weeks it's trading the small waves of this stock to try to push it down under dangerous strike prices. A wave of positive sentiment could strangle this position in the stock. I don't have a Bloomberg terminal, but based on the evidence over the last several days, the indication is the 13.1% SI has grown.
* Exceptional open option interest for **tomorrow 5/21/2021.** The options expiring tomorrow have been documented elsewhere so I won't belabor them, but the open interest at the $9, and $10 strike represent almost 10% of the free float.
* Not a new startup, **they have been in this business since 1986**, making them almost as old as a fossil like me. They clearly survived the 2008 storm. This company isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

The cherry:

* **STILL forecasting growth in Q2**, whereas many of its competitors are not.

This post is NOT financial advice, but as someone who has ridden the waves of this stock since it was about $9, I see this position turning positive and the outlook through July for this position has high sentiment. Even if the mortgage market slows down as expected, I will hold these shares for years to come for the dividends and general stability of the organization.

My position 8000 shares @ 7.65 and 45x 6/18 8c. You can go stalk the fuck out of me if you want to see that I've been talking about this stock for some time and been saying the same thing about the strength and targets of their position since March. I am also the guy that tells you when you unintentionally reveal personal info on your yolo screenshots!

TLDR: UWMC should garner close attention for value investors looking for undervalued positions.

5374,,2021-05-20 13:28:43,t3_nh08j4,,wallstreetbets,"**Investment Thesis**

Overall, what makes MDXG a good buying opportunity right now is a combination of two factors.

* Number one is management‚Äôs miscommunication with the market. The market currently believes that wound care is the core business of MDXG, is not entirely aware of the potential of its biopharma pipeline and more specifically its Amniofix drug, and has priced the company based on this.¬†
* Number two is the huge potential of the Amniofix treatment and its ability to become the next blockbuster in the healthcare space after the conclusion of its phase 3 trial.

**Idea Summary**

MiMedx Group *(MDXG)* is a leading BioPharma and wound care business whose value has been drastically misunderstood by the market. Through drivers such as miscommunication from management about the company‚Äôs valued proposition as well as the lack of institutional investor coverage, the market currently believes that the majority of the company‚Äôs value sits in its low growth wound care business. In reality, its major competitive advantage is within its osteoarthritis drug Amniofix which has the potential to become the next blockbuster after it clears phase III clinical trials. A sum of the parts valuation was used to determine a minimum implied upside of at least 300%. Risks are discussed at the end.

**Business Overview**

MiMedx Group is a leading biopharma and advanced wound care business utilizing human placental tissues to develop products used in the healthcare sector. It processes placental tissues using its patented processes to produce allografts, which are tissues transplanted from one person to another for wound care and regeneration. These allografts are effective in healing difficult wounds because of the ability of the allograft cells to quickly associate with the cells of the patient, thereby taking part in the healing process, easing the ability of the body to close the wound, and speeding up the body‚Äôs regeneration process.

MDXG‚Äôs product offerings can be split into two business segments: wound care and biopharma (surgical solutions). Its flagship product Epifix and additional product Epicord fall under its wound care umbrella, and its flagship product Amniofix as well as additional products Amniocord, Amniofill, and Epiburn fall under its biopharma umbrella. The wound care products service the broad wound care industry, targeting specifically chronic wounds. The biopharma product line is more specific, with the flagship treatment Amniofix targeting knee osteoarthritis in specific.¬†

MDXG sells through direct sales, sales agents, and distributors in the United States. This past quarter, 95% of its sales were direct to customers such as healthcare professionals and facilities.¬†

**Internal Analysis**

The past 3 years have not been ideal for MDXG. Its revenues began to dip in 2018 around the time of their accounting scandal, the growth went from 40% in 2018, to 11% in 2019, and is currently around -16%. This sent their stock price tumbling from $16 USD to lows of almost $1 USD, though it is currently trading at $9 with new updates on their biopharma pipeline.

Their gross margin has stayed very high, around 80% while their EBITDA margins have dropped over the years. Though it wasn‚Äôt explicitly disclosed, a large part of this drop in EBITDA margins has been attributed to a temporary increase in legal fees due to the litigation MDXG has faced this past year. Its decreased volume may have also suppressed margins as the number of wound care treatments in hospitals significantly dropped during COVID-19.¬†

The company‚Äôs cash balance is sitting at a very high level of 84 mm. This is in large part due to its recent capital raise, which happened to be strongly criticized by one of MDXG‚Äôs activist investors, Prescience Point Capital (discussed in detail later).

**External Analysis**

*Wound Care Market*

The global wound care market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% from 2021 to 2028. This has been driven by the aging population and rising rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Wound care products are increasingly being used to prevent and surgical site infections.¬†

Though the overall market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% the specific advanced product segment which includes products such as those of MDXG‚Äôs which target chronic and non-healing wounds, is projected to grow much faster than 4.1%.¬†

The wound care market is relatively fragmented, with large players such as Integra LifeSciences, 3M, Johnson & Johnson, and Medtronic competing to gain the most market share. MDXG‚Äôs direct competition for its allograft advanced wound care treatments include Organogenesis, Axogen, Mediwound, and Vericel.¬†

Organogenesis is currently in the lead in this niche market, and while MDXG reported an 11% YoY decline in sales in 2020 (which has already been factored into the current price), Organogenesis reported a 30% increase. This is evident when comparing the stock performance of both companies over the past year (figure 1)

*Osteoarthritis Therapy Market*

91 million U.S. adults have arthritis, 20M have knee OA, and \~32 million per year are currently treated for plantar fasciitis, which is specifically targeted by MDXG‚Äôs Amniofix drug. There are very few FDA approved treatments for knee OA and plantar fasciitis, and those that exist have low efficacy and many drawbacks. Amniofix is currently the only treatment of its nature in phase 3 clinical trials that have posted very positive results in both company and independent trials, has been used off-label by >100K patients with zero severe adverse effects, and consistently demonstrates a significant reduction in pain as reported by patients. In addition, Amniofix has an RMAT (regenerative medicine advanced therapy) designation granted by the FDA which allows for MDXG to benefit from an expedited approval process from the FDA.

*Management Miscommunication*

The current market opinion of MDXG has been blurred by the miscommunication from company management whose goals do not align with maximizing shareholder value. This is largely due to the fact that EW healthcare, a private equity firm, has 33% representation on the board as a result of its 17% stake. From a corporate finance perspective, a private equity firm‚Äôs interests do not generally tend to align with those of public shareholders. Their influence has been exacerbated by the fact that there are no large institutional holdings in MDXG as of yet other than Prescience Point, and there has been minimal coverage on the stock leading to the market‚Äôs opinion on the company being heavily skewed by management communications.¬†

MDXG‚Äôs current growth strategy is focused on roll-ups in the wound care space. This is very characteristic of a private equity playbook, and goes alongside EW‚Äôs historical acquisitions. As was mentioned in the external analysis, the wound care space is growing at a slow rate of \~4.1%, however MDXG has lost significant market share to Organogenesis. Management has failed to realize that the current value driver of the business is within its biopharma line and not its wound care line, yet has continually communicated to shareholders that it believes it is in fact wound care and it is going to continue investing in growing within the industry.

Prescience Point Capital, an activist investor group which has advocated for change in MDXG's communication strategy, has supported the fact that MDXG‚Äôs communications have been focused on the wrong industry. At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, the potential for the drug Amniofix was drastically undersold and much time was spent convincing investors that the core business is in wound care. The 3.6% decline in shares two days after the conference illustrates how effective this strategy was.¬†

There has been strong opposition from MDXG‚Äôs board of directors to Prescience Point‚Äôs activist efforts. In a shareholder letter in early May, prior to their annual meeting, the company communicated that they believe the wound care and regenerative medicine direction being followed now is ideal. They stated that the activist investor does not understand pharmaceutical company disclosure and were advocating for speculative actions themselves though Prescience‚Äôs report discusses the opposite, with them outlining how EW‚Äôs influence on the board of directors is shifting the company‚Äôs focus away from maximizing shareholder value.

*Amniofix*

As mentioned in the external analysis, there is currently no other treatment, either in development or on the market, as effective as Amniofix in treating knee OA and also just as safe. Most recently, at its Q1 earnings call, MDXG CEO shared positive results from the phase IIb prospective trial of the treatment. There was a statistically significant reduction in VAS (visual analog score) for pain and an improvement in the foot function index score. There were also no serious adverse events during this clinical trial. Amniofix is currently in phase III trials, and MDXG believes they are on target to meet all criteria needed to find a biologics license application (BLA) so that the treatment can be introduced to the general public. MDXG is aiming to file their BLA in the first half of 2022, meaning that within a year this blockbuster treatment could be on the market, and given the feedback so far from clinical trials as well as the RMAT designation, it is highly likely.

A Prescience Point market capture analysis estimated that the treatment would bring in $4,050 million of annual sales. This is \~8 times higher than the current sales brought in through wound care. One year ago it would have been prudent to not entirely incorporate this into the share price, however today with clinical trials nearing completion and MDXG‚Äôs new RMAT designation, the likelihood of approval is much higher.

**Valuation**

From a valuation point of view, a quick sum of the parts analysis is the most ideal given the two different business lines of MDXG. A more in-depth DCF can be created once more cost information is provided from MDXG after the conclusion of clinical trials.

Shares outstanding of 109.8 mm, total debt of 51.8 mm, and total cash of 84.7mm were used to convert from enterprise value to equity value. The current implied upside was calculated using the current price of $9.46.

*Wound Care Valuation*

MDXG‚Äôs FY 2021 sales guidance assumed $255 mm to $270 mm in revenue from the wound care segment. Different points in this revenue ranged were used for the low, base, and high cases of the valuation. An EV/Revenue multiple was used to calculate implied enterprise value. The comparables analysis shown in figure 2 illustrated the median multiples derived from the analysis done using the aforementioned list of MDXG‚Äôs competitors. A median multiple of 5.3x was used. The median was used and not marked down because the gross margin and UFCF yield of MDXG is in-line with all competitors. Though the EBIDTA multiple was lower, the similar yield and gross margins indicate that company performance is relatively the same. In addition, litigation expenses factored into the lower EBIDTA multiples and thus it is not indicative of recurring performance.

Based on the revenue multiples, implied share values for the wound care segment range between $12.0 and $12.8.

**Wound Care Equity Value**

**Biopharma Valuation**

Prescience Point estimated annual revenues from Amniofix through using the market capture method. The total market size (annual knee OA injections) was estimated, and a capture percentage was applied to determine the annual number of patients receiving the Amniofix injection. Prescience assumed 1.5 injections per year but to be more conservative in this valuation 1 was used. Price per injection and FDA approval probability varied by the cases and were used to adjust the EV/Rev multiple downwards. Overall, an implied share value range between $25.4 and $57.1 was calculated for this segment.

https://preview.redd.it/we0pw4jm1a071.png?width=611&format=png&auto=webp&s=567d19cc5acc59acbe552a2afcf09789c80866ff

**Biopharma Equity Value**

Overall, the total implied share price ranges between $37.43 to $69.81. As more information regarding Amniofix comes out including the price of manufacturing, different multiples can be used to fine-tune the analysis.

https://preview.redd.it/a8035yfo1a071.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=12e0f9a041e326b505bfda25304261367c651406

**Risks**

1. Given the high influence EW healthcare has on the board of directors, there is potential for more value to describe acquisitions such as that of stability biologics, which was bought for 10 million and sold for 3.5 million 3 years later. If such a trend continues, the value of MDXG‚Äôs wound care business can dramatically decrease, which will hurt the share pierce
2. The FDA approval of Amniofix is a large driver of the valuation calculated. There is a large risk that the FDA will not approve the treatment, however, with the RMAT designation in place and positive results from the first two phases of clinical trials, the odds are strongly in the favour of the approval at the current point in time.

Overall MDXG has been strongly misrepresented by management leading to a skewed opinion and pricing by the market.",nh08j4,$MDXG - Management Miscommunication Skews Valuation Down and Creates Great Buying Opportunity

For those who don't know, $EEM - or the iShares Emerging Markets ETF - is comprised of stocks from developing nations, with a **ton** of room to grow. These countries **will** all catch up soon, it's only a matter of time. This is one of the many reasons I find this setup especially interesting.

Here are the top holdings:

[$EEM Holdings \(By Country\)](https://preview.redd.it/zh7nwb2hfa071.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cb2749a2c7d6c7f548ad89a3f9a746b56d2273)

Next, let's dig into the charts -

Chart 1: **Max Monthly (\~16 Years)**

[$EEM Max Monthly](https://preview.redd.it/ylknrqzhea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=91ee9718b89c47744e6f68224a133c48c7bcfc6f)

Here you can see we have a **symmetrical triangle** pattern that dates back to late 2007. In technical analysis, the longer the pattern has been building, the more significant the breakout will be. Subsequently - you can imagine the magnitude a pattern like this has.

When making new all time highs I like to look for psychological resistances. As a result - logical targets for this pattern are **75.00, 100.00.** Sounds simple, but it works in practice. Keep in mind - something like this will take **3 - 5 years** to play out. This is a position trade.

In order for this breakout to stay valid - we need to continue getting monthly closes above **50.85.** You can see we've pretty much gone perfectly sideways since breaking out for **4 months** now.

This is **bullish -** moving sideways in a higher range is always biased to the upside (except in special situations with certain reversal patterns). Not only that, but we've been forming an interesting setup on the next chart I will show you all -

Chart 2: **1 Year 1 Day**

[$EEM 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/7hy7wbqeea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8102c5b1f0e92c02260cfccc6b8d77eafea8035d)

On this chart - you can make much more sense of those 4 months of sideways. We are actually working on a large **falling wedge** \- which is a bullish continuation pattern. The breakout point for this is sitting around **54.37** as I am writing this (5/20/2021).

Upon breaking this (ignoring the previous chart) - we would target **54.94, 56.49, 57.32, 60.00, 65.00.** That would be if there was no setup on the monthly chart. Each of these are resistances we could stop and consolidate at. I like to scale in after breaking each resistance. Scale into winners and cut losers fast. A break from a pattern like this would probably take **3 - 6 months** to play out.

I also want to note that **MASSIVE** increase in volume on 3/26. Generally - an uptick on volume when price is doing what you want it to is always a plus. But one like that is very intriguing - on a huge green candle too. My guess would be someone loaded their bags there (or a group of players).

And... **that's it.** Keep it simple. Those are often the best setups.

***TL;DR -***

$EEM has a big pattern - broke out 4 months ago just chopping sideways waiting for the move to happen.

Price targets **75.00, 100.00**

Stop out below **50.87** monthly close

Timeframe **3-5 years**

It also has a smaller pattern above that one - which breaks out above **54.37** and has a shorter time horizon.

Price targets **60.00, 65.00**

Stop out if we close back inside

Timeframe **3-6 months**

***Positions -***

10% of my long term portfolio is in emerging markets ETFs and,

August **55c @ 0.91** \- Will always roll these back before they get below 60 DTE - Will scale in heavily after the smaller pattern breaks out

\- These drugs have been extremely effective in treating addiction -- particularly alcohol and nicotine. Considering the government expenditure on the opioid crisis, once this proves to be an effective treatment, the government will expedite the medicinal legalization of the substances that MNMD has been treating/experimenting with.

\- Veterans, the most respected occupational category (statistically,) have begun launching advocacy groups for the widespread medicinal legalization of these substances due to their effectiveness against PTSD. These therapeutic measures have contributed to the plummeting of suicide rates (those treated w/ psilocybin vs. control group.) The Biden administration will have to choose ethics and reason over the suffering of veterans (former government employees) which I anticipate that they will given mounting pressure due to the effectiveness of these treatments.

&#x200B;

Does this hinge on expected earnings in the long-run ... certainly!

&#x200B;

But the effectiveness of this research is undeniable and can no longer be overlooked ... because of new cultural acceptance of these alternative treatments the government's hand will be forced in legalize, or otherwise be responsible for mental illness and addiction -- all of which could be treated and cured.

If you aren't familiar with the efficient frontier, what it tries to find is the *mean-variance portfolio.* This type of model deals with portfolio management / optimization. In terms of the efficient frontier you are trying to find the best portfolio allocation weights that give you the best risk adjusted returns. 

**In simple words:** you give it stocks and it tells you the best percentage holdings

I recently built an app on some python code that does this sort of optimization. There is no programming required to use the app. When running the app it will give two portfolios, minimum variance, and maximized sharpe (same as mean-variance, mean-markowitz). Minimum variance will tell you the least riskiest holding strategy (green), and max sharpe will give you the best reward-for-risk holding (red). I call that portfolio *the-juice-is-worth-the-squeeze.* Here is a sample output.

I used around 100,000 simulations, and 10Y of adjusted close data. 

The reason why I bring this up is because it does two things. The first is that it promotes portfolio diversification, which I know is pretty uncommon here. Also it finds the most aggressive returns in terms of minimizing risk. If you have high returns and wonder why you returns are so much higher than standard investment funds its probably because you are here

Yah you may good returns, you are probably taking on more risk than what you are getting in return.

#Topics of discussion:

* Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks

* WDC Fundamentals

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community.

A little bit about myself for context:

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/555339dhob071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42585b1cfe4cf1c85eab62b0cc01791f5321f1e2

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",nh8f2j,PUBM DD #1

5398,,2021-05-20 19:09:28,t3_nh8q8x,,wallstreetbets," So this is the first time I've ever played around with options and I'm probably doing it in a dumb way but get that's more fun for you guys to watch. I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

Nokia Stock Forecast: $10 by 2025

By [MIKE STENGER](https://moneymorning.com/author/mstenger/), Associate Editor, *Money Morning* ‚Ä¢ May 20, 2021

Nokia stock has waited in the bullpen for years. Now, it may finally get the catalyst needed for a triple-digit rage. The Nokia stock forecast for 2025 is $10, more than double what it is today.

And this is happening sooner than later‚Ä¶

The Finnish telecom fell with the best of them in the 2020 COVID-19 crash, down near $3. Its growth couldn't match the broad market rally in the months that followed, though it did regain some footing in the $5 range.

üì∑

Nokia almost hit $7 when the Robinhood craze came about in January 2021. Those were levels unseen in the last decade.

Well, it's about to do it again. And this time, it's going even further.

Nokia was also one of the ""meme stocks"" making headlines alongside GameStop Corp. (NYSE: [GME](https://moneymorning.websol.barchart.com/?module=symbolSearch&override=1&symbol=GME)) and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (NYSE: [AMC](https://moneymorning.websol.barchart.com/?module=symbolSearch&override=1&symbol=AMC)). Hedge funds that were short on the stock were put in a difficult ""squeeze"" position where they had to buy back shares for more than they sold them.

However, some traders were unable to buy in as Nokia was among the stocks for which Robinhood controversially paused trading.

Now that the hype has mostly faded, we still have a solid $4.91 Nokia stock price, steadily climbing toward the previous $5 analyst target.

Two big market stories will move the Nokia stock price over the next decade. The rise of the Robinhood trader will continue to play a role. And 5G will start to show the results we've all been waiting for.

But one could make it a buy immediately.

Nokia's 5G Is Catching On

Probably the biggest driver of the Nokia stock price is future 5G hopes. According to ***Allied Market Research***, the 5G market could rise to $667 billion by 2026, which will have been a 1,526% rise from its 2020 value. Nokia could gain a significant portion of that.

We said in our 2021 Nokia stock forecast that the company would have to edge out a few of its global competitors to do this ‚Äì China's Huawei and Sweden's Ericsson.

While both companies are larger than Nokia, it looks like Nokia stands a chance against them both, as predicted in our 2021 Nokia stock price prediction.",nhdgyk,Very conservative outlook for NOK

This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let‚Äôs go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don‚Äôt need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there‚Äôs a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

I have a position in both, and before either camp starts screaming about how one is more revolutionary, or has better blah blah blah, realize that the only thing driving price action for either is public sentiment. UWMC declared a regular dividend while RKT only a special.

Evan was very reassuring that shareholders of $UWMC would receive the correct rate, but data in app still doesn't match. Considering your size in the brokerage game, I hope that you realize how important it is that your data is accurate.

Google shows dividend yield 4.78%. Other brokerage showing the same amount within .03%. RH shows as less than 2% and has for some time. Been bugging me since about Q1. I've owned this company on another platform since SPAC merger.

Evan was very reassuring that shareholders of $UWMC would receive the correct rate, but data in app still doesn't match. Considering your size in the brokerage game, I hope that you realize how important it is that your data is accurate.

Google shows dividend yield 4.78%. Other brokerage showing the same amount within .03%. RH shows as less than 2% and has for some time. Been bugging me since about Q1. I've owned this company on another platform since SPAC merger.

From the minute I heard the interview I realized that this person had no clue what she was talking about. To the credit of the Podcast hosts they mentioned that ARKK would have issues with outflows leading to lower stock prices in a later Podcast, which they have. I should have shorted it, but I'm not rich. Here are some of her stances:

&#x200B;

She predicts CoinBit $500,000.

She is all-in on Tesla.

She thinks gene editing is a sound investment at this time.

She has decreased her position in Netflix.

&#x200B;

I think that the increase size of her fund will continue to limit her ability to invest in anything interesting. The longshots in her portfolio which have had massive success are often successful because her fund's investment has massively increased their market cap.  She has also tied herself so tightly to Tesla that she can never hop off that ride. She's tied to the autopilot whether it goes to the moon or into a tree. I'm not denying that she has had good results during this bull market, but I think a fund that goes the other direction will do very well over the next 5 years.

What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either. 

Here is some better and more thought out DD:

5872,,2021-05-19 20:14:45,t3_ngftx1,,wallstreetbets,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",ngftx1,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Mr. Cramer..."

Big tech's earnings absolutely destroyed estimates but sell side thinks it's due to lock down and people will rely on tech less once things open up. It's a consistent pattern that all the gains made after earning erode overnight or in a few trading session as if the good earning did not happen.

I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

5877,,2021-05-19 21:25:26,t3_nghmhm,,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",nghmhm,$NUE is strong as steel. Buy the dips.

Petco earnings is tomorrow pre-market. But this also might be a potential candidate for a short squeeze.

Short sellers are gearing up for a bad quarter. For the last three days, the short float increased from 4 point-something Monday, 6.05 yesterday, and today it's at 8.75.

In addition, short interest is up to 35.2%

To top it off, there are hardly any shares available to short, though borrowing rate remains at only 1%. For the last five days there were no more than 100k shares left to short.

The average price target is $28, but if earnings goes better than expected, this could be the catalyst for something significantly bigger. Listen to your pets' beckoning calls, and keep this on your watch list!

Two major catalysts are on the near horizon:

1) Earnings report on 5/24 AH: Confirmation of late Q3 production and disclosure of binding orders have a high probability of being announced.

2) Lordstown Week (June 21-25): Plant open house for tours, test drives, etc., and above all else, transparency.  This should alone should put the final nail in the shorts coffin.

5889,,2021-05-20 05:24:49,t3_ngrqqf,,wallstreetbets,"Some context: Cell carriers in the US have decided to stop the function of shared short codes (5-6 digit phone numbers) June 1. Shared short codes were the preferred means of SMS and MMS communication for B2C traffic. Short codes were free to lease in many cases, text messages were cheap, thousands of businesses could send from the same number, and throughput was incredibly high (lots of messages could be sent very fast).

The new policy enforced by the CTIA (The private club all major cell phone carriers are in) is that shared short codes are to be discontinued and replaced by dedicated short codes and A2P 10dlc (approved B2C traffic on 10-digit phone numbers). This means that every business/organization that wants to send texts must either apply for a dedicated short code or apply for a 10DLC. 

Dedicated short codes are the preferred choice for large corporations. They can handle large throughput and look good for the brand. However, they only cater to large corporations because they are thousands of dollars/year to lease. Turn around time for application is 4-6 weeks. Barrier to entry is high.

10DLC is the preferred choice for the smaller businesses since it's less expensive. But, it is still far more expensive than the shared short codes businesses are used to, requires application, and costs $50/mo in carrier and registration fees alone. Turn around time for application is less than a week. On top of fees, 10dlc isn't even fully ready. The Campaign Registry, the organization responsible for rolling out ""the new messaging standard"" for the CTIA, is still developing their API.

Enter Toll-free messaging. TF has 0 barrier to entry and can be issued to a business with SMS and MMS capabilities in seconds. It's the easiest and now the most cost-effective way to send commercial messages.

Conveniently, every major carrier announced this month (for the first time) that they will start collecting a $0.0025/message fee for every sms sent. They're ready for and expecting businesses to move to this method.

Who is Zipwhip: Zipwhip was given full reign over all TF traffic. Anyone in the US  that wants to send messages on TF codes uses Zipwhip in one way or another. They are a massive reseller that everyone is required to go through.

It was recently announced the Twilio plans on acquiring Zipwhip for $850M. Twilio is the leader is programmable messaging hands down. 

Honestly, there should be antitrust issues that arise and block the acquisition. If it goes through, Twilio owns the new world of business sms. Good chance regulators won't notice any issue. They'll miss the fact that businesses will be pressured into TF over their preferred solutions (dedicated short codes and A2P 10DLC) since it's unnecessarily complicated and expensive. TF is ready now and cheap.

TL;DR if Twilio successfully acquires Zipwhip, every small to medium sized business that wants to send texts will have to go through them. Every single one of them in the US.",ngrqqf,$TWLO stands to be the primary source for commercial text messaging

5892,,2021-05-20 08:25:07,t3_ngulnq,,wallstreetbets,"So just how big is **today's news about the initial success of the Sofusa technology**?

1st, this is a technology that aims at lymphatic delivery. 

**What does this mean?** Well, when trying to fight a disease, it's difficult to target the lymphatic system. Because of how it works and the fact that it is spread throughout our body. 

So there are MANY, MANY drugs out there that treat several conditions through the lymphatic system. But, because of what we just explained, those drugs sometimes don't work. They are not properly ""delivered"". They don't get to where they need to get to make the necessary interaction and solve the problem.

**Sorrento has developed a technology that can deliver drugs to where they actually need to go** in the lymphatic system. So this is definitely breakthrough technology. Other companies are aiming to find similar solutions. But we are definitely talking about very advanced bio-tech.

In this case, we have a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. This is a condition that worsens with time. It's very painful and limits the patient's movement. It's not very common, so we are talking about 1.5 million people in the USA and about 30 million worldwide. 

But remember, **the technology Sorrento is developing  will be able to deliver drugs treating many other diseases** related to the lymphatic system. So the market for Sofusa is very, very large.

The press release tells us Sofusa was tested on ""First Enbrel-Non-Responding"" patients. 

**What does this mean?** Patients who need the drug Enbrel and, even though they have not been taking the drug for long (it's a ""first"" for them) they are not responding to it. It isn't helping them. 

Now, Sofusa comes into play. It's job is to deliver Enbrel to the patient effectively. To ""take"" Enbrel to where it needs to go in the lymphatic system.. 

The 1st obvious advantage is that the drug wasn't helping and now helps. But there are other important advantages.

Since the drug is being carried to its targeted ""destination"" the dosage needed, diminishes. Because less is ""lost along the way"". This is important because many diseases related to the lymphatic system, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are chronic, lifelong conditions. Being able to administer less drugs really helps the patient. Now you have a drug that actually works, more potently, which reduces its dosage. All this thanks to Sorrento.

The press release points out an important factor: This is a trial on ONE type of drug/treatment. Other such trials testing the effectiveness of Sofusa are already taking place. Again, this is proof of the potentially huge market for this delivery system.

Just to get an idea, the release mentions anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. These are a type of drugs that inhibit the activity of certain proteins (they inhibit PD1 and CTLA4, which are types of proteins. By stopping their activity, they help in stopping the growth of cancer tumors). There are several drugs that fall under these categories and treat a wide variety of cancers. **Sofusa can potentially play a vital role in all these treatments**. 

This is like several companies developing apps while Sorrento is developing a new smartphone technology. Each app has its rightful use and market. But once the new smartphone is up and working, all apps will need it. So this technology has huge revenue implications. T**he fact we are hearing good news about it is HUGE**.

As for the results themselves: **The DAS28 test measures rheumatoid activity in 28 joints** in the patient's body. The joints might be swollen or tender (hurting).

This patient had a DAS28 score of 4.6, with 18 out of 28 joints compromised.  That is considered  moderate to high disease activity.  There are 4 levels of DAS 28 scores going from remission (the best) to high (the worst). So this patient was not in the worst shape going in, but pretty bad.

Using Sofusa to deliver the Enbrel drug, in just 4 weeks (this is a very short time for this type of disease!!) the results went from 4.6 to 3.0. The total amount of compromised joints, from 18 to 11. **That is a dramatic change**. The patient went from being somewhere between level 3 and 4, to being in the lower level 2, called ""low disease activity"", which indicates it's moving towards remission (the lowest level). For someone suffering from this condition, it's a real life changer. For the company selling Enbrel, it's a real market changer. And if it can equally help people with tumors, **Sofusa becomes a major therapeutic factor.** 

I hope investors understand this. **It's another major development in an already extremely promising pipeline** which is currently badly undervalued. If the price doesn't spike today by 10-15%, as it should, just from this news, it would be disappointing. 

But if you are long, today's price change isn't what matters the most. It‚Äôs the understanding that Sorrento / SRNE has ANOTHER ace in its hand!",ngulnq,How Big is SRNE news release about Sofusa success?

* Announced a **$300M stock buyback, representing as much as 40% of the free float** at the current prices.
* Russell index inclusion was missed last quarter due to confusion about their PREVIOUS status as a SPAC. It is expected that they will be reconsidered for Russell Index inclusions in the yearly reconstitution. While not the biggest catalyst, this is a sign of reputation and long-term stability for the stock. **The prelim list publishes 6/4/2021.**
* Creation of a jumbo mortgage product. The average loan origination in the market is \~410,000, indicating that the non-conforming section of the mortgage market is *exploding.* This is a very profitable sector of loan origination.

Other fundamentals driving a buy recommendation:

* Small float. 90M float, of which only about 60M is freely trading.
* This stock is not persistently pressured down quite as hard as others due to low share availability, but it appears based on the last two weeks it's trading the small waves of this stock to try to push it down under dangerous strike prices. A wave of positive sentiment could strangle this position in the stock. I don't have a Bloomberg terminal, but based on the evidence over the last several days, the indication is the 13.1% SI has grown.
* Exceptional open option interest for **tomorrow 5/21/2021.** The options expiring tomorrow have been documented elsewhere so I won't belabor them, but the open interest at the $9, and $10 strike represent almost 10% of the free float.
* Not a new startup, **they have been in this business since 1986**, making them almost as old as a fossil like me. They clearly survived the 2008 storm. This company isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

The cherry:

* **STILL forecasting growth in Q2**, whereas many of its competitors are not.

This post is NOT financial advice, but as someone who has ridden the waves of this stock since it was about $9, I see this position turning positive and the outlook through July for this position has high sentiment. Even if the mortgage market slows down as expected, I will hold these shares for years to come for the dividends and general stability of the organization.

My position 8000 shares @ 7.65 and 45x 6/18 8c. You can go stalk the fuck out of me if you want to see that I've been talking about this stock for some time and been saying the same thing about the strength and targets of their position since March. I am also the guy that tells you when you unintentionally reveal personal info on your yolo screenshots!

5903,,2021-05-20 13:28:43,t3_nh08j4,,wallstreetbets,"**Investment Thesis**

Overall, what makes MDXG a good buying opportunity right now is a combination of two factors.

* Number one is management‚Äôs miscommunication with the market. The market currently believes that wound care is the core business of MDXG, is not entirely aware of the potential of its biopharma pipeline and more specifically its Amniofix drug, and has priced the company based on this.¬†
* Number two is the huge potential of the Amniofix treatment and its ability to become the next blockbuster in the healthcare space after the conclusion of its phase 3 trial.

**Idea Summary**

MiMedx Group *(MDXG)* is a leading BioPharma and wound care business whose value has been drastically misunderstood by the market. Through drivers such as miscommunication from management about the company‚Äôs valued proposition as well as the lack of institutional investor coverage, the market currently believes that the majority of the company‚Äôs value sits in its low growth wound care business. In reality, its major competitive advantage is within its osteoarthritis drug Amniofix which has the potential to become the next blockbuster after it clears phase III clinical trials. A sum of the parts valuation was used to determine a minimum implied upside of at least 300%. Risks are discussed at the end.

**Business Overview**

MiMedx Group is a leading biopharma and advanced wound care business utilizing human placental tissues to develop products used in the healthcare sector. It processes placental tissues using its patented processes to produce allografts, which are tissues transplanted from one person to another for wound care and regeneration. These allografts are effective in healing difficult wounds because of the ability of the allograft cells to quickly associate with the cells of the patient, thereby taking part in the healing process, easing the ability of the body to close the wound, and speeding up the body‚Äôs regeneration process.

MDXG‚Äôs product offerings can be split into two business segments: wound care and biopharma (surgical solutions). Its flagship product Epifix and additional product Epicord fall under its wound care umbrella, and its flagship product Amniofix as well as additional products Amniocord, Amniofill, and Epiburn fall under its biopharma umbrella. The wound care products service the broad wound care industry, targeting specifically chronic wounds. The biopharma product line is more specific, with the flagship treatment Amniofix targeting knee osteoarthritis in specific.¬†

MDXG sells through direct sales, sales agents, and distributors in the United States. This past quarter, 95% of its sales were direct to customers such as healthcare professionals and facilities.¬†

**Internal Analysis**

The past 3 years have not been ideal for MDXG. Its revenues began to dip in 2018 around the time of their accounting scandal, the growth went from 40% in 2018, to 11% in 2019, and is currently around -16%. This sent their stock price tumbling from $16 USD to lows of almost $1 USD, though it is currently trading at $9 with new updates on their biopharma pipeline.

Their gross margin has stayed very high, around 80% while their EBITDA margins have dropped over the years. Though it wasn‚Äôt explicitly disclosed, a large part of this drop in EBITDA margins has been attributed to a temporary increase in legal fees due to the litigation MDXG has faced this past year. Its decreased volume may have also suppressed margins as the number of wound care treatments in hospitals significantly dropped during COVID-19.¬†

The company‚Äôs cash balance is sitting at a very high level of 84 mm. This is in large part due to its recent capital raise, which happened to be strongly criticized by one of MDXG‚Äôs activist investors, Prescience Point Capital (discussed in detail later).

**External Analysis**

*Wound Care Market*

The global wound care market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% from 2021 to 2028. This has been driven by the aging population and rising rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Wound care products are increasingly being used to prevent and surgical site infections.¬†

Though the overall market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% the specific advanced product segment which includes products such as those of MDXG‚Äôs which target chronic and non-healing wounds, is projected to grow much faster than 4.1%.¬†

The wound care market is relatively fragmented, with large players such as Integra LifeSciences, 3M, Johnson & Johnson, and Medtronic competing to gain the most market share. MDXG‚Äôs direct competition for its allograft advanced wound care treatments include Organogenesis, Axogen, Mediwound, and Vericel.¬†

Organogenesis is currently in the lead in this niche market, and while MDXG reported an 11% YoY decline in sales in 2020 (which has already been factored into the current price), Organogenesis reported a 30% increase. This is evident when comparing the stock performance of both companies over the past year (figure 1)

*Osteoarthritis Therapy Market*

91 million U.S. adults have arthritis, 20M have knee OA, and \~32 million per year are currently treated for plantar fasciitis, which is specifically targeted by MDXG‚Äôs Amniofix drug. There are very few FDA approved treatments for knee OA and plantar fasciitis, and those that exist have low efficacy and many drawbacks. Amniofix is currently the only treatment of its nature in phase 3 clinical trials that have posted very positive results in both company and independent trials, has been used off-label by >100K patients with zero severe adverse effects, and consistently demonstrates a significant reduction in pain as reported by patients. In addition, Amniofix has an RMAT (regenerative medicine advanced therapy) designation granted by the FDA which allows for MDXG to benefit from an expedited approval process from the FDA.

*Management Miscommunication*

The current market opinion of MDXG has been blurred by the miscommunication from company management whose goals do not align with maximizing shareholder value. This is largely due to the fact that EW healthcare, a private equity firm, has 33% representation on the board as a result of its 17% stake. From a corporate finance perspective, a private equity firm‚Äôs interests do not generally tend to align with those of public shareholders. Their influence has been exacerbated by the fact that there are no large institutional holdings in MDXG as of yet other than Prescience Point, and there has been minimal coverage on the stock leading to the market‚Äôs opinion on the company being heavily skewed by management communications.¬†

MDXG‚Äôs current growth strategy is focused on roll-ups in the wound care space. This is very characteristic of a private equity playbook, and goes alongside EW‚Äôs historical acquisitions. As was mentioned in the external analysis, the wound care space is growing at a slow rate of \~4.1%, however MDXG has lost significant market share to Organogenesis. Management has failed to realize that the current value driver of the business is within its biopharma line and not its wound care line, yet has continually communicated to shareholders that it believes it is in fact wound care and it is going to continue investing in growing within the industry.

Prescience Point Capital, an activist investor group which has advocated for change in MDXG's communication strategy, has supported the fact that MDXG‚Äôs communications have been focused on the wrong industry. At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, the potential for the drug Amniofix was drastically undersold and much time was spent convincing investors that the core business is in wound care. The 3.6% decline in shares two days after the conference illustrates how effective this strategy was.¬†

There has been strong opposition from MDXG‚Äôs board of directors to Prescience Point‚Äôs activist efforts. In a shareholder letter in early May, prior to their annual meeting, the company communicated that they believe the wound care and regenerative medicine direction being followed now is ideal. They stated that the activist investor does not understand pharmaceutical company disclosure and were advocating for speculative actions themselves though Prescience‚Äôs report discusses the opposite, with them outlining how EW‚Äôs influence on the board of directors is shifting the company‚Äôs focus away from maximizing shareholder value.

*Amniofix*

As mentioned in the external analysis, there is currently no other treatment, either in development or on the market, as effective as Amniofix in treating knee OA and also just as safe. Most recently, at its Q1 earnings call, MDXG CEO shared positive results from the phase IIb prospective trial of the treatment. There was a statistically significant reduction in VAS (visual analog score) for pain and an improvement in the foot function index score. There were also no serious adverse events during this clinical trial. Amniofix is currently in phase III trials, and MDXG believes they are on target to meet all criteria needed to find a biologics license application (BLA) so that the treatment can be introduced to the general public. MDXG is aiming to file their BLA in the first half of 2022, meaning that within a year this blockbuster treatment could be on the market, and given the feedback so far from clinical trials as well as the RMAT designation, it is highly likely.

A Prescience Point market capture analysis estimated that the treatment would bring in $4,050 million of annual sales. This is \~8 times higher than the current sales brought in through wound care. One year ago it would have been prudent to not entirely incorporate this into the share price, however today with clinical trials nearing completion and MDXG‚Äôs new RMAT designation, the likelihood of approval is much higher.

**Valuation**

From a valuation point of view, a quick sum of the parts analysis is the most ideal given the two different business lines of MDXG. A more in-depth DCF can be created once more cost information is provided from MDXG after the conclusion of clinical trials.

Shares outstanding of 109.8 mm, total debt of 51.8 mm, and total cash of 84.7mm were used to convert from enterprise value to equity value. The current implied upside was calculated using the current price of $9.46.

*Wound Care Valuation*

MDXG‚Äôs FY 2021 sales guidance assumed $255 mm to $270 mm in revenue from the wound care segment. Different points in this revenue ranged were used for the low, base, and high cases of the valuation. An EV/Revenue multiple was used to calculate implied enterprise value. The comparables analysis shown in figure 2 illustrated the median multiples derived from the analysis done using the aforementioned list of MDXG‚Äôs competitors. A median multiple of 5.3x was used. The median was used and not marked down because the gross margin and UFCF yield of MDXG is in-line with all competitors. Though the EBIDTA multiple was lower, the similar yield and gross margins indicate that company performance is relatively the same. In addition, litigation expenses factored into the lower EBIDTA multiples and thus it is not indicative of recurring performance.

Based on the revenue multiples, implied share values for the wound care segment range between $12.0 and $12.8.

**Wound Care Equity Value**

**Biopharma Valuation**

Prescience Point estimated annual revenues from Amniofix through using the market capture method. The total market size (annual knee OA injections) was estimated, and a capture percentage was applied to determine the annual number of patients receiving the Amniofix injection. Prescience assumed 1.5 injections per year but to be more conservative in this valuation 1 was used. Price per injection and FDA approval probability varied by the cases and were used to adjust the EV/Rev multiple downwards. Overall, an implied share value range between $25.4 and $57.1 was calculated for this segment.

https://preview.redd.it/we0pw4jm1a071.png?width=611&format=png&auto=webp&s=567d19cc5acc59acbe552a2afcf09789c80866ff

**Biopharma Equity Value**

Overall, the total implied share price ranges between $37.43 to $69.81. As more information regarding Amniofix comes out including the price of manufacturing, different multiples can be used to fine-tune the analysis.

https://preview.redd.it/a8035yfo1a071.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=12e0f9a041e326b505bfda25304261367c651406

**Risks**

1. Given the high influence EW healthcare has on the board of directors, there is potential for more value to describe acquisitions such as that of stability biologics, which was bought for 10 million and sold for 3.5 million 3 years later. If such a trend continues, the value of MDXG‚Äôs wound care business can dramatically decrease, which will hurt the share pierce
2. The FDA approval of Amniofix is a large driver of the valuation calculated. There is a large risk that the FDA will not approve the treatment, however, with the RMAT designation in place and positive results from the first two phases of clinical trials, the odds are strongly in the favour of the approval at the current point in time.

For those who don't know, $EEM - or the iShares Emerging Markets ETF - is comprised of stocks from developing nations, with a **ton** of room to grow. These countries **will** all catch up soon, it's only a matter of time. This is one of the many reasons I find this setup especially interesting.

Here are the top holdings:

[$EEM Holdings \(By Country\)](https://preview.redd.it/zh7nwb2hfa071.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cb2749a2c7d6c7f548ad89a3f9a746b56d2273)

Next, let's dig into the charts -

Chart 1: **Max Monthly (\~16 Years)**

[$EEM Max Monthly](https://preview.redd.it/ylknrqzhea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=91ee9718b89c47744e6f68224a133c48c7bcfc6f)

Here you can see we have a **symmetrical triangle** pattern that dates back to late 2007. In technical analysis, the longer the pattern has been building, the more significant the breakout will be. Subsequently - you can imagine the magnitude a pattern like this has.

When making new all time highs I like to look for psychological resistances. As a result - logical targets for this pattern are **75.00, 100.00.** Sounds simple, but it works in practice. Keep in mind - something like this will take **3 - 5 years** to play out. This is a position trade.

In order for this breakout to stay valid - we need to continue getting monthly closes above **50.85.** You can see we've pretty much gone perfectly sideways since breaking out for **4 months** now.

This is **bullish -** moving sideways in a higher range is always biased to the upside (except in special situations with certain reversal patterns). Not only that, but we've been forming an interesting setup on the next chart I will show you all -

Chart 2: **1 Year 1 Day**

[$EEM 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/7hy7wbqeea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8102c5b1f0e92c02260cfccc6b8d77eafea8035d)

On this chart - you can make much more sense of those 4 months of sideways. We are actually working on a large **falling wedge** \- which is a bullish continuation pattern. The breakout point for this is sitting around **54.37** as I am writing this (5/20/2021).

Upon breaking this (ignoring the previous chart) - we would target **54.94, 56.49, 57.32, 60.00, 65.00.** That would be if there was no setup on the monthly chart. Each of these are resistances we could stop and consolidate at. I like to scale in after breaking each resistance. Scale into winners and cut losers fast. A break from a pattern like this would probably take **3 - 6 months** to play out.

I also want to note that **MASSIVE** increase in volume on 3/26. Generally - an uptick on volume when price is doing what you want it to is always a plus. But one like that is very intriguing - on a huge green candle too. My guess would be someone loaded their bags there (or a group of players).

And... **that's it.** Keep it simple. Those are often the best setups.

***TL;DR -***

$EEM has a big pattern - broke out 4 months ago just chopping sideways waiting for the move to happen.

Price targets **75.00, 100.00**

Stop out below **50.87** monthly close

Timeframe **3-5 years**

It also has a smaller pattern above that one - which breaks out above **54.37** and has a shorter time horizon.

Price targets **60.00, 65.00**

Stop out if we close back inside

Timeframe **3-6 months**

***Positions -***

10% of my long term portfolio is in emerging markets ETFs and,

August **55c @ 0.91** \- Will always roll these back before they get below 60 DTE - Will scale in heavily after the smaller pattern breaks out

\- Research coming out of John Hopkins University is suggesting that the use of Psilocybin is the most effective drug ever tested as a remedy for depression, anxiety, and PTSD. As the United States is currently under crisis in its battle against mental illness, these results are too impressive to ignore, even if it may need to overcome pressures from big pharma interest groups that seek to quell the expansion of this research.

\- These drugs have been extremely effective in treating addiction -- particularly alcohol and nicotine. Considering the government expenditure on the opioid crisis, once this proves to be an effective treatment, the government will expedite the medicinal legalization of the substances that MNMD has been treating/experimenting with.

\- Veterans, the most respected occupational category (statistically,) have begun launching advocacy groups for the widespread medicinal legalization of these substances due to their effectiveness against PTSD. These therapeutic measures have contributed to the plummeting of suicide rates (those treated w/ psilocybin vs. control group.) The Biden administration will have to choose ethics and reason over the suffering of veterans (former government employees) which I anticipate that they will given mounting pressure due to the effectiveness of these treatments.

&#x200B;

Does this hinge on expected earnings in the long-run ... certainly!

&#x200B;

But the effectiveness of this research is undeniable and can no longer be overlooked ... because of new cultural acceptance of these alternative treatments the government's hand will be forced in legalize, or otherwise be responsible for mental illness and addiction -- all of which could be treated and cured.

5913,,2021-05-20 16:06:53,t3_nh45af,,wallstreetbets,"I want to first start off by saying that I'm not liable for financial losses. I recently built an app that can generate efficient frontiers when you plug in individual US Equities. 

If you aren't familiar with the efficient frontier, what it tries to find is the *mean-variance portfolio.* This type of model deals with portfolio management / optimization. In terms of the efficient frontier you are trying to find the best portfolio allocation weights that give you the best risk adjusted returns. 

**In simple words:** you give it stocks and it tells you the best percentage holdings

I recently built an app on some python code that does this sort of optimization. There is no programming required to use the app. When running the app it will give two portfolios, minimum variance, and maximized sharpe (same as mean-variance, mean-markowitz). Minimum variance will tell you the least riskiest holding strategy (green), and max sharpe will give you the best reward-for-risk holding (red). I call that portfolio *the-juice-is-worth-the-squeeze.* Here is a sample output.

I used around 100,000 simulations, and 10Y of adjusted close data. 

The reason why I bring this up is because it does two things. The first is that it promotes portfolio diversification, which I know is pretty uncommon here. Also it finds the most aggressive returns in terms of minimizing risk. If you have high returns and wonder why you returns are so much higher than standard investment funds its probably because you are here

Yah you may good returns, you are probably taking on more risk than what you are getting in return.

How high could it go? Well If we take a look at the graph below, we can see that SPCE peaked at around 60 bucks  back in February in ANTICIPATION for the previous test flight which was delayed until May for safety reasons (They had some problems with electromagnetic interference which is fixed now).

Currently the price is around 18-19 bucks, so it's an absolute steal in my opinion, but there is always the risk that some shit fucks up and the test flight is delayed even further, in which case I will have to sell the house.

In this post I'm going to not talk about some kind of currency that can get this post removed. Hint: it crashed big time yesterday. You know the one.

There is a new kind of this currency that uses a lot of computer storage space. How much? Well - 7 EXABYTES and it's currently adding 1 exabyte every 3 days. I'm going to assume you know about this currency and if not you can look through my post history and see which subreddit I've posted to recently involving this particular one.

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

I believe the technology will allow for a more personal approach in the field of medicine, and should not be viewed solely as a research-based company.  

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community.

A little bit about myself for context:

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/555339dhob071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42585b1cfe4cf1c85eab62b0cc01791f5321f1e2

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",nh8f2j,PUBM DD #1

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

Now that Tellurian (TELL) has crossed the 1bln market cap, you are ready to find out about what has the potential to be your biggest play this year.

Tellurian is a stock that‚Äôs been rattled by short sellers, whom the chairman Charif Souki despises and he‚Äôs been pretty vocal about it. The stock price tumbled 60% as a result of aggressive shorting since February and it appeared that the company isn‚Äôt going anywhere. 

However, they have recently repaid most of their debt and are about to start construction of their Driftwood LNG project this summer. They are said to be announcing commercial agreements over the next few weeks which is where the best part comes in‚Ä¶

If you have a browse through the options chain (https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tell/option-chain) you will notice the ridiculous open interest on Jan 22 calls with a strike price of‚Ä¶ 15usd!

It appears that insiders know that big volume contracts are coming and are betting on huge moves with the stock price coming back to its former glory. 

Combined with a significant short volume this has the potential to be a very explosive stock over the coming months.

Position: 9750 shares at 2.44usd

Nokia Stock Forecast: $10 by 2025

By [MIKE STENGER](https://moneymorning.com/author/mstenger/), Associate Editor, *Money Morning* ‚Ä¢ May 20, 2021

Nokia stock has waited in the bullpen for years. Now, it may finally get the catalyst needed for a triple-digit rage. The Nokia stock forecast for 2025 is $10, more than double what it is today.

And this is happening sooner than later‚Ä¶

The Finnish telecom fell with the best of them in the 2020 COVID-19 crash, down near $3. Its growth couldn't match the broad market rally in the months that followed, though it did regain some footing in the $5 range.

üì∑

Nokia almost hit $7 when the Robinhood craze came about in January 2021. Those were levels unseen in the last decade.

Well, it's about to do it again. And this time, it's going even further.

Nokia was also one of the ""meme stocks"" making headlines alongside GameStop Corp. (NYSE: [GME](https://moneymorning.websol.barchart.com/?module=symbolSearch&override=1&symbol=GME)) and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (NYSE: [AMC](https://moneymorning.websol.barchart.com/?module=symbolSearch&override=1&symbol=AMC)). Hedge funds that were short on the stock were put in a difficult ""squeeze"" position where they had to buy back shares for more than they sold them.

However, some traders were unable to buy in as Nokia was among the stocks for which Robinhood controversially paused trading.

Now that the hype has mostly faded, we still have a solid $4.91 Nokia stock price, steadily climbing toward the previous $5 analyst target.

Two big market stories will move the Nokia stock price over the next decade. The rise of the Robinhood trader will continue to play a role. And 5G will start to show the results we've all been waiting for.

But one could make it a buy immediately.

Nokia's 5G Is Catching On

Probably the biggest driver of the Nokia stock price is future 5G hopes. According to ***Allied Market Research***, the 5G market could rise to $667 billion by 2026, which will have been a 1,526% rise from its 2020 value. Nokia could gain a significant portion of that.

We said in our 2021 Nokia stock forecast that the company would have to edge out a few of its global competitors to do this ‚Äì China's Huawei and Sweden's Ericsson.

While both companies are larger than Nokia, it looks like Nokia stands a chance against them both, as predicted in our 2021 Nokia stock price prediction.",nhdgyk,Very conservative outlook for NOK
5943,,2021-05-20 22:42:55,t3_nhdnzi,,wallstreetbets,"The cruise line industry has been nearly brought to extinction during the pandemic, but with the vaccines being distributed, cruise lines are making a major comeback. 
This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let‚Äôs go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don‚Äôt need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there‚Äôs a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

Overall, I‚Äôm bullish and have over 30 call contracts expiring this July üöÄüöÄüöÄ",nhdnzi,Bull Cruise $CCL primed to explode üöÄüöÄüìàüöÄ

There is little difference in their lines of business at the moment, margins are similar, products are similar. There‚Äôs very little differentiation, he‚Äôll they‚Äôre in the same city. UWMC has had a better post-earnings period not because their top line YOY growth was so good or even indicative of something remotely possible to sustain moving forward, but really just because of the dividend and chest pounding against RKT.

I have a position in both, and before either camp starts screaming about how one is more revolutionary, or has better blah blah blah, realize that the only thing driving price action for either is public sentiment. UWMC declared a regular dividend while RKT only a special. 

Next week, either Jay Farner gets flashy (new dividend, massive auto rollout, something new) and starts publicly pushing back against Ishbia, or RKT continues downward. I think it‚Äôs 50/50 but looks ripe for anyone looking for a straddle yolo, with IV not as bad as it was before.

I should have shorted it, but I'm not rich. Here are some of her stances:

She predicts CoinBit $500,000.

She is all-in on Tesla.

She thinks gene editing is a sound investment at this time.

She has decreased her position in Netflix.

&#x200B;

I think that the increase size of her fund will continue to limit her ability to invest in anything interesting. The longshots in her portfolio which have had massive success are often successful because her fund's investment has massively increased their market cap.  She has also tied herself so tightly to Tesla that she can never hop off that ride. She's tied to the autopilot whether it goes to the moon or into a tree. I'm not denying that she has had good results during this bull market, but I think a fund that goes the other direction will do very well over the next 5 years.

What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either. 

Here is some better and more thought out DD:

6196,,2021-05-19 20:14:45,t3_ngftx1,,wallstreetbets,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",ngftx1,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Mr. Cramer..."

6199,,2021-05-19 20:51:00,t3_nggpql,,wallstreetbets,"I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

6201,,2021-05-19 21:25:26,t3_nghmhm,,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",nghmhm,$NUE is strong as steel. Buy the dips.

Petco earnings is tomorrow pre-market. But this also might be a potential candidate for a short squeeze.

Short sellers are gearing up for a bad quarter. For the last three days, the short float increased from 4 point-something Monday, 6.05 yesterday, and today it's at 8.75.

In addition, short interest is up to 35.2%

To top it off, there are hardly any shares available to short, though borrowing rate remains at only 1%. For the last five days there were no more than 100k shares left to short.

The average price target is $28, but if earnings goes better than expected, this could be the catalyst for something significantly bigger. Listen to your pets' beckoning calls, and keep this on your watch list!

We‚Äôve had a run up of 55% from 5/6-5/17 to $14.38 high on 5/17.  Slight gain of 0.6% on 5/18 (similar to the slight drop on 3/19 with freaky similar volume changes) and then the massive sell off decline on 5/19 of (9.9%) is eerily similar to the (10.3%) drop on 3/22.......

Potential to give up all of the gains since 5/6 by this Friday and puts are ridiculously cheap in the $10 below range for 5/21 and 5/28.  If AMC goes on a similar slide to the March slide, there will be massive returns on these ridiculously cheap put options (9.9% decline today and the sub $10 puts barely moved in price on both the 5/21 and 5/28 expiration dates.

Cheap way to place a bet if the squeeze doesn‚Äôt materialize that could be a >10x return based on how cheap the <$10 puts are for 5/21 and 5/28 put options.

If you are holding stock, max gains you are getting for $20 is ~2x but this could be the real money maker with puts sub $10 priced at $0.01-$0.05 that could go to $0.5+ if the stock slides similar to the March slide.

6213,,2021-05-20 05:24:49,t3_ngrqqf,,wallstreetbets,"Some context: Cell carriers in the US have decided to stop the function of shared short codes (5-6 digit phone numbers) June 1. Shared short codes were the preferred means of SMS and MMS communication for B2C traffic. Short codes were free to lease in many cases, text messages were cheap, thousands of businesses could send from the same number, and throughput was incredibly high (lots of messages could be sent very fast).

The new policy enforced by the CTIA (The private club all major cell phone carriers are in) is that shared short codes are to be discontinued and replaced by dedicated short codes and A2P 10dlc (approved B2C traffic on 10-digit phone numbers). This means that every business/organization that wants to send texts must either apply for a dedicated short code or apply for a 10DLC. 

Dedicated short codes are the preferred choice for large corporations. They can handle large throughput and look good for the brand. However, they only cater to large corporations because they are thousands of dollars/year to lease. Turn around time for application is 4-6 weeks. Barrier to entry is high.

10DLC is the preferred choice for the smaller businesses since it's less expensive. But, it is still far more expensive than the shared short codes businesses are used to, requires application, and costs $50/mo in carrier and registration fees alone. Turn around time for application is less than a week. On top of fees, 10dlc isn't even fully ready. The Campaign Registry, the organization responsible for rolling out ""the new messaging standard"" for the CTIA, is still developing their API.

Enter Toll-free messaging. TF has 0 barrier to entry and can be issued to a business with SMS and MMS capabilities in seconds. It's the easiest and now the most cost-effective way to send commercial messages.

Conveniently, every major carrier announced this month (for the first time) that they will start collecting a $0.0025/message fee for every sms sent. They're ready for and expecting businesses to move to this method.

Who is Zipwhip: Zipwhip was given full reign over all TF traffic. Anyone in the US  that wants to send messages on TF codes uses Zipwhip in one way or another. They are a massive reseller that everyone is required to go through.

It was recently announced the Twilio plans on acquiring Zipwhip for $850M. Twilio is the leader is programmable messaging hands down. 

Honestly, there should be antitrust issues that arise and block the acquisition. If it goes through, Twilio owns the new world of business sms. Good chance regulators won't notice any issue. They'll miss the fact that businesses will be pressured into TF over their preferred solutions (dedicated short codes and A2P 10DLC) since it's unnecessarily complicated and expensive. TF is ready now and cheap.

TL;DR if Twilio successfully acquires Zipwhip, every small to medium sized business that wants to send texts will have to go through them. Every single one of them in the US.",ngrqqf,$TWLO stands to be the primary source for commercial text messaging

6216,,2021-05-20 08:25:07,t3_ngulnq,,wallstreetbets,"So just how big is **today's news about the initial success of the Sofusa technology**?

1st, this is a technology that aims at lymphatic delivery. 

**What does this mean?** Well, when trying to fight a disease, it's difficult to target the lymphatic system. Because of how it works and the fact that it is spread throughout our body. 

So there are MANY, MANY drugs out there that treat several conditions through the lymphatic system. But, because of what we just explained, those drugs sometimes don't work. They are not properly ""delivered"". They don't get to where they need to get to make the necessary interaction and solve the problem.

**Sorrento has developed a technology that can deliver drugs to where they actually need to go** in the lymphatic system. So this is definitely breakthrough technology. Other companies are aiming to find similar solutions. But we are definitely talking about very advanced bio-tech.

In this case, we have a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. This is a condition that worsens with time. It's very painful and limits the patient's movement. It's not very common, so we are talking about 1.5 million people in the USA and about 30 million worldwide. 

But remember, **the technology Sorrento is developing  will be able to deliver drugs treating many other diseases** related to the lymphatic system. So the market for Sofusa is very, very large.

The press release tells us Sofusa was tested on ""First Enbrel-Non-Responding"" patients. 

**What does this mean?** Patients who need the drug Enbrel and, even though they have not been taking the drug for long (it's a ""first"" for them) they are not responding to it. It isn't helping them. 

Now, Sofusa comes into play. It's job is to deliver Enbrel to the patient effectively. To ""take"" Enbrel to where it needs to go in the lymphatic system.. 

The 1st obvious advantage is that the drug wasn't helping and now helps. But there are other important advantages.

Since the drug is being carried to its targeted ""destination"" the dosage needed, diminishes. Because less is ""lost along the way"". This is important because many diseases related to the lymphatic system, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are chronic, lifelong conditions. Being able to administer less drugs really helps the patient. Now you have a drug that actually works, more potently, which reduces its dosage. All this thanks to Sorrento.

The press release points out an important factor: This is a trial on ONE type of drug/treatment. Other such trials testing the effectiveness of Sofusa are already taking place. Again, this is proof of the potentially huge market for this delivery system.

Just to get an idea, the release mentions anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. These are a type of drugs that inhibit the activity of certain proteins (they inhibit PD1 and CTLA4, which are types of proteins. By stopping their activity, they help in stopping the growth of cancer tumors). There are several drugs that fall under these categories and treat a wide variety of cancers. **Sofusa can potentially play a vital role in all these treatments**. 

This is like several companies developing apps while Sorrento is developing a new smartphone technology. Each app has its rightful use and market. But once the new smartphone is up and working, all apps will need it. So this technology has huge revenue implications. T**he fact we are hearing good news about it is HUGE**.

As for the results themselves: **The DAS28 test measures rheumatoid activity in 28 joints** in the patient's body. The joints might be swollen or tender (hurting).

This patient had a DAS28 score of 4.6, with 18 out of 28 joints compromised.  That is considered  moderate to high disease activity.  There are 4 levels of DAS 28 scores going from remission (the best) to high (the worst). So this patient was not in the worst shape going in, but pretty bad.

Using Sofusa to deliver the Enbrel drug, in just 4 weeks (this is a very short time for this type of disease!!) the results went from 4.6 to 3.0. The total amount of compromised joints, from 18 to 11. **That is a dramatic change**. The patient went from being somewhere between level 3 and 4, to being in the lower level 2, called ""low disease activity"", which indicates it's moving towards remission (the lowest level). For someone suffering from this condition, it's a real life changer. For the company selling Enbrel, it's a real market changer. And if it can equally help people with tumors, **Sofusa becomes a major therapeutic factor.** 

I hope investors understand this. **It's another major development in an already extremely promising pipeline** which is currently badly undervalued. If the price doesn't spike today by 10-15%, as it should, just from this news, it would be disappointing. 

But if you are long, today's price change isn't what matters the most. It‚Äôs the understanding that Sorrento / SRNE has ANOTHER ace in its hand!",ngulnq,How Big is SRNE news release about Sofusa success?

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC and its +23% run in the past week. A stock with a massive dividend. A stock trading with a very low P/E of and income growth of 4,200%.

So why is this stock still a buy and hold for me right now?

The CEO is positioning them to increase shareholder value, but also position the company to weather any reduction in the refi market. (65% of the business)

There are major catalysts that have been driving the increase in price that goes beyond the attention gained on WSB.

* Announced **NET earnings of $860M in the first quarter,** with huge margins.
* Reaffirmed a continued dividend, the next ex-dividend date is **6/9/2021**.
* Announced a **$300M stock buyback, representing as much as 40% of the free float** at the current prices.
* Russell index inclusion was missed last quarter due to confusion about their PREVIOUS status as a SPAC. It is expected that they will be reconsidered for Russell Index inclusions in the yearly reconstitution. While not the biggest catalyst, this is a sign of reputation and long-term stability for the stock. **The prelim list publishes 6/4/2021.**
* Creation of a jumbo mortgage product. The average loan origination in the market is \~410,000, indicating that the non-conforming section of the mortgage market is *exploding.* This is a very profitable sector of loan origination.

Other fundamentals driving a buy recommendation:

* Small float. 90M float, of which only about 60M is freely trading.
* This stock is not persistently pressured down quite as hard as others due to low share availability, but it appears based on the last two weeks it's trading the small waves of this stock to try to push it down under dangerous strike prices. A wave of positive sentiment could strangle this position in the stock. I don't have a Bloomberg terminal, but based on the evidence over the last several days, the indication is the 13.1% SI has grown.
* Exceptional open option interest for **tomorrow 5/21/2021.** The options expiring tomorrow have been documented elsewhere so I won't belabor them, but the open interest at the $9, and $10 strike represent almost 10% of the free float.
* Not a new startup, **they have been in this business since 1986**, making them almost as old as a fossil like me. They clearly survived the 2008 storm. This company isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

The cherry:

* **STILL forecasting growth in Q2**, whereas many of its competitors are not.

This post is NOT financial advice, but as someone who has ridden the waves of this stock since it was about $9, I see this position turning positive and the outlook through July for this position has high sentiment. Even if the mortgage market slows down as expected, I will hold these shares for years to come for the dividends and general stability of the organization.

My position 8000 shares @ 7.65 and 45x 6/18 8c. You can go stalk the fuck out of me if you want to see that I've been talking about this stock for some time and been saying the same thing about the strength and targets of their position since March. I am also the guy that tells you when you unintentionally reveal personal info on your yolo screenshots!

TLDR: UWMC should garner close attention for value investors looking for undervalued positions.

6227,,2021-05-20 13:28:43,t3_nh08j4,,wallstreetbets,"**Investment Thesis**

Overall, what makes MDXG a good buying opportunity right now is a combination of two factors.

* Number one is management‚Äôs miscommunication with the market. The market currently believes that wound care is the core business of MDXG, is not entirely aware of the potential of its biopharma pipeline and more specifically its Amniofix drug, and has priced the company based on this.¬†
* Number two is the huge potential of the Amniofix treatment and its ability to become the next blockbuster in the healthcare space after the conclusion of its phase 3 trial.

**Idea Summary**

MiMedx Group *(MDXG)* is a leading BioPharma and wound care business whose value has been drastically misunderstood by the market. Through drivers such as miscommunication from management about the company‚Äôs valued proposition as well as the lack of institutional investor coverage, the market currently believes that the majority of the company‚Äôs value sits in its low growth wound care business. In reality, its major competitive advantage is within its osteoarthritis drug Amniofix which has the potential to become the next blockbuster after it clears phase III clinical trials. A sum of the parts valuation was used to determine a minimum implied upside of at least 300%. Risks are discussed at the end.

**Business Overview**

MiMedx Group is a leading biopharma and advanced wound care business utilizing human placental tissues to develop products used in the healthcare sector. It processes placental tissues using its patented processes to produce allografts, which are tissues transplanted from one person to another for wound care and regeneration. These allografts are effective in healing difficult wounds because of the ability of the allograft cells to quickly associate with the cells of the patient, thereby taking part in the healing process, easing the ability of the body to close the wound, and speeding up the body‚Äôs regeneration process.

MDXG‚Äôs product offerings can be split into two business segments: wound care and biopharma (surgical solutions). Its flagship product Epifix and additional product Epicord fall under its wound care umbrella, and its flagship product Amniofix as well as additional products Amniocord, Amniofill, and Epiburn fall under its biopharma umbrella. The wound care products service the broad wound care industry, targeting specifically chronic wounds. The biopharma product line is more specific, with the flagship treatment Amniofix targeting knee osteoarthritis in specific.¬†

MDXG sells through direct sales, sales agents, and distributors in the United States. This past quarter, 95% of its sales were direct to customers such as healthcare professionals and facilities.¬†

**Internal Analysis**

The past 3 years have not been ideal for MDXG. Its revenues began to dip in 2018 around the time of their accounting scandal, the growth went from 40% in 2018, to 11% in 2019, and is currently around -16%. This sent their stock price tumbling from $16 USD to lows of almost $1 USD, though it is currently trading at $9 with new updates on their biopharma pipeline.

Their gross margin has stayed very high, around 80% while their EBITDA margins have dropped over the years. Though it wasn‚Äôt explicitly disclosed, a large part of this drop in EBITDA margins has been attributed to a temporary increase in legal fees due to the litigation MDXG has faced this past year. Its decreased volume may have also suppressed margins as the number of wound care treatments in hospitals significantly dropped during COVID-19.¬†

The company‚Äôs cash balance is sitting at a very high level of 84 mm. This is in large part due to its recent capital raise, which happened to be strongly criticized by one of MDXG‚Äôs activist investors, Prescience Point Capital (discussed in detail later).

**External Analysis**

*Wound Care Market*

The global wound care market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% from 2021 to 2028. This has been driven by the aging population and rising rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Wound care products are increasingly being used to prevent and surgical site infections.¬†

Though the overall market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% the specific advanced product segment which includes products such as those of MDXG‚Äôs which target chronic and non-healing wounds, is projected to grow much faster than 4.1%.¬†

The wound care market is relatively fragmented, with large players such as Integra LifeSciences, 3M, Johnson & Johnson, and Medtronic competing to gain the most market share. MDXG‚Äôs direct competition for its allograft advanced wound care treatments include Organogenesis, Axogen, Mediwound, and Vericel.¬†

Organogenesis is currently in the lead in this niche market, and while MDXG reported an 11% YoY decline in sales in 2020 (which has already been factored into the current price), Organogenesis reported a 30% increase. This is evident when comparing the stock performance of both companies over the past year (figure 1)

*Osteoarthritis Therapy Market*

91 million U.S. adults have arthritis, 20M have knee OA, and \~32 million per year are currently treated for plantar fasciitis, which is specifically targeted by MDXG‚Äôs Amniofix drug. There are very few FDA approved treatments for knee OA and plantar fasciitis, and those that exist have low efficacy and many drawbacks. Amniofix is currently the only treatment of its nature in phase 3 clinical trials that have posted very positive results in both company and independent trials, has been used off-label by >100K patients with zero severe adverse effects, and consistently demonstrates a significant reduction in pain as reported by patients. In addition, Amniofix has an RMAT (regenerative medicine advanced therapy) designation granted by the FDA which allows for MDXG to benefit from an expedited approval process from the FDA.

*Management Miscommunication*

The current market opinion of MDXG has been blurred by the miscommunication from company management whose goals do not align with maximizing shareholder value. This is largely due to the fact that EW healthcare, a private equity firm, has 33% representation on the board as a result of its 17% stake. From a corporate finance perspective, a private equity firm‚Äôs interests do not generally tend to align with those of public shareholders. Their influence has been exacerbated by the fact that there are no large institutional holdings in MDXG as of yet other than Prescience Point, and there has been minimal coverage on the stock leading to the market‚Äôs opinion on the company being heavily skewed by management communications.¬†

MDXG‚Äôs current growth strategy is focused on roll-ups in the wound care space. This is very characteristic of a private equity playbook, and goes alongside EW‚Äôs historical acquisitions. As was mentioned in the external analysis, the wound care space is growing at a slow rate of \~4.1%, however MDXG has lost significant market share to Organogenesis. Management has failed to realize that the current value driver of the business is within its biopharma line and not its wound care line, yet has continually communicated to shareholders that it believes it is in fact wound care and it is going to continue investing in growing within the industry.

Prescience Point Capital, an activist investor group which has advocated for change in MDXG's communication strategy, has supported the fact that MDXG‚Äôs communications have been focused on the wrong industry. At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, the potential for the drug Amniofix was drastically undersold and much time was spent convincing investors that the core business is in wound care. The 3.6% decline in shares two days after the conference illustrates how effective this strategy was.¬†

There has been strong opposition from MDXG‚Äôs board of directors to Prescience Point‚Äôs activist efforts. In a shareholder letter in early May, prior to their annual meeting, the company communicated that they believe the wound care and regenerative medicine direction being followed now is ideal. They stated that the activist investor does not understand pharmaceutical company disclosure and were advocating for speculative actions themselves though Prescience‚Äôs report discusses the opposite, with them outlining how EW‚Äôs influence on the board of directors is shifting the company‚Äôs focus away from maximizing shareholder value.

*Amniofix*

As mentioned in the external analysis, there is currently no other treatment, either in development or on the market, as effective as Amniofix in treating knee OA and also just as safe. Most recently, at its Q1 earnings call, MDXG CEO shared positive results from the phase IIb prospective trial of the treatment. There was a statistically significant reduction in VAS (visual analog score) for pain and an improvement in the foot function index score. There were also no serious adverse events during this clinical trial. Amniofix is currently in phase III trials, and MDXG believes they are on target to meet all criteria needed to find a biologics license application (BLA) so that the treatment can be introduced to the general public. MDXG is aiming to file their BLA in the first half of 2022, meaning that within a year this blockbuster treatment could be on the market, and given the feedback so far from clinical trials as well as the RMAT designation, it is highly likely.

A Prescience Point market capture analysis estimated that the treatment would bring in $4,050 million of annual sales. This is \~8 times higher than the current sales brought in through wound care. One year ago it would have been prudent to not entirely incorporate this into the share price, however today with clinical trials nearing completion and MDXG‚Äôs new RMAT designation, the likelihood of approval is much higher.

**Valuation**

From a valuation point of view, a quick sum of the parts analysis is the most ideal given the two different business lines of MDXG. A more in-depth DCF can be created once more cost information is provided from MDXG after the conclusion of clinical trials.

Shares outstanding of 109.8 mm, total debt of 51.8 mm, and total cash of 84.7mm were used to convert from enterprise value to equity value. The current implied upside was calculated using the current price of $9.46.

*Wound Care Valuation*

MDXG‚Äôs FY 2021 sales guidance assumed $255 mm to $270 mm in revenue from the wound care segment. Different points in this revenue ranged were used for the low, base, and high cases of the valuation. An EV/Revenue multiple was used to calculate implied enterprise value. The comparables analysis shown in figure 2 illustrated the median multiples derived from the analysis done using the aforementioned list of MDXG‚Äôs competitors. A median multiple of 5.3x was used. The median was used and not marked down because the gross margin and UFCF yield of MDXG is in-line with all competitors. Though the EBIDTA multiple was lower, the similar yield and gross margins indicate that company performance is relatively the same. In addition, litigation expenses factored into the lower EBIDTA multiples and thus it is not indicative of recurring performance.

Based on the revenue multiples, implied share values for the wound care segment range between $12.0 and $12.8.

**Wound Care Equity Value**

**Biopharma Valuation**

Prescience Point estimated annual revenues from Amniofix through using the market capture method. The total market size (annual knee OA injections) was estimated, and a capture percentage was applied to determine the annual number of patients receiving the Amniofix injection. Prescience assumed 1.5 injections per year but to be more conservative in this valuation 1 was used. Price per injection and FDA approval probability varied by the cases and were used to adjust the EV/Rev multiple downwards. Overall, an implied share value range between $25.4 and $57.1 was calculated for this segment.

**Biopharma Equity Value**

Overall, the total implied share price ranges between $37.43 to $69.81. As more information regarding Amniofix comes out including the price of manufacturing, different multiples can be used to fine-tune the analysis.

https://preview.redd.it/a8035yfo1a071.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=12e0f9a041e326b505bfda25304261367c651406

**Risks**

1. Given the high influence EW healthcare has on the board of directors, there is potential for more value to describe acquisitions such as that of stability biologics, which was bought for 10 million and sold for 3.5 million 3 years later. If such a trend continues, the value of MDXG‚Äôs wound care business can dramatically decrease, which will hurt the share pierce
2. The FDA approval of Amniofix is a large driver of the valuation calculated. There is a large risk that the FDA will not approve the treatment, however, with the RMAT designation in place and positive results from the first two phases of clinical trials, the odds are strongly in the favour of the approval at the current point in time.

For those who don't know, $EEM - or the iShares Emerging Markets ETF - is comprised of stocks from developing nations, with a **ton** of room to grow. These countries **will** all catch up soon, it's only a matter of time. This is one of the many reasons I find this setup especially interesting.

Here are the top holdings:

[$EEM Holdings \(By Country\)](https://preview.redd.it/zh7nwb2hfa071.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cb2749a2c7d6c7f548ad89a3f9a746b56d2273)

Next, let's dig into the charts -

Chart 1: **Max Monthly (\~16 Years)**

[$EEM Max Monthly](https://preview.redd.it/ylknrqzhea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=91ee9718b89c47744e6f68224a133c48c7bcfc6f)

Here you can see we have a **symmetrical triangle** pattern that dates back to late 2007. In technical analysis, the longer the pattern has been building, the more significant the breakout will be. Subsequently - you can imagine the magnitude a pattern like this has.

When making new all time highs I like to look for psychological resistances. As a result - logical targets for this pattern are **75.00, 100.00.** Sounds simple, but it works in practice. Keep in mind - something like this will take **3 - 5 years** to play out. This is a position trade.

In order for this breakout to stay valid - we need to continue getting monthly closes above **50.85.** You can see we've pretty much gone perfectly sideways since breaking out for **4 months** now.

This is **bullish -** moving sideways in a higher range is always biased to the upside (except in special situations with certain reversal patterns). Not only that, but we've been forming an interesting setup on the next chart I will show you all -

Chart 2: **1 Year 1 Day**

[$EEM 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/7hy7wbqeea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8102c5b1f0e92c02260cfccc6b8d77eafea8035d)

On this chart - you can make much more sense of those 4 months of sideways. We are actually working on a large **falling wedge** \- which is a bullish continuation pattern. The breakout point for this is sitting around **54.37** as I am writing this (5/20/2021).

Upon breaking this (ignoring the previous chart) - we would target **54.94, 56.49, 57.32, 60.00, 65.00.** That would be if there was no setup on the monthly chart. Each of these are resistances we could stop and consolidate at. I like to scale in after breaking each resistance. Scale into winners and cut losers fast. A break from a pattern like this would probably take **3 - 6 months** to play out.

I also want to note that **MASSIVE** increase in volume on 3/26. Generally - an uptick on volume when price is doing what you want it to is always a plus. But one like that is very intriguing - on a huge green candle too. My guess would be someone loaded their bags there (or a group of players).

And... **that's it.** Keep it simple. Those are often the best setups.

***TL;DR -***

$EEM has a big pattern - broke out 4 months ago just chopping sideways waiting for the move to happen.

Price targets **75.00, 100.00**

Stop out below **50.87** monthly close

Timeframe **3-5 years**

It also has a smaller pattern above that one - which breaks out above **54.37** and has a shorter time horizon.

Price targets **60.00, 65.00**

Stop out if we close back inside

Timeframe **3-6 months**

***Positions -***

10% of my long term portfolio is in emerging markets ETFs and,

August **55c @ 0.91** \- Will always roll these back before they get below 60 DTE - Will scale in heavily after the smaller pattern breaks out

\- Research coming out of John Hopkins University is suggesting that the use of Psilocybin is the most effective drug ever tested as a remedy for depression, anxiety, and PTSD. As the United States is currently under crisis in its battle against mental illness, these results are too impressive to ignore, even if it may need to overcome pressures from big pharma interest groups that seek to quell the expansion of this research.

\- These drugs have been extremely effective in treating addiction -- particularly alcohol and nicotine. Considering the government expenditure on the opioid crisis, once this proves to be an effective treatment, the government will expedite the medicinal legalization of the substances that MNMD has been treating/experimenting with.

\- Veterans, the most respected occupational category (statistically,) have begun launching advocacy groups for the widespread medicinal legalization of these substances due to their effectiveness against PTSD. These therapeutic measures have contributed to the plummeting of suicide rates (those treated w/ psilocybin vs. control group.) The Biden administration will have to choose ethics and reason over the suffering of veterans (former government employees) which I anticipate that they will given mounting pressure due to the effectiveness of these treatments.

&#x200B;

Does this hinge on expected earnings in the long-run ... certainly!

&#x200B;

But the effectiveness of this research is undeniable and can no longer be overlooked ... because of new cultural acceptance of these alternative treatments the government's hand will be forced in legalize, or otherwise be responsible for mental illness and addiction -- all of which could be treated and cured.

If you aren't familiar with the efficient frontier, what it tries to find is the *mean-variance portfolio.* This type of model deals with portfolio management / optimization. In terms of the efficient frontier you are trying to find the best portfolio allocation weights that give you the best risk adjusted returns. 

**In simple words:** you give it stocks and it tells you the best percentage holdings

I recently built an app on some python code that does this sort of optimization. There is no programming required to use the app. When running the app it will give two portfolios, minimum variance, and maximized sharpe (same as mean-variance, mean-markowitz). Minimum variance will tell you the least riskiest holding strategy (green), and max sharpe will give you the best reward-for-risk holding (red). I call that portfolio *the-juice-is-worth-the-squeeze.* Here is a sample output.

I used around 100,000 simulations, and 10Y of adjusted close data. 

The reason why I bring this up is because it does two things. The first is that it promotes portfolio diversification, which I know is pretty uncommon here. Also it finds the most aggressive returns in terms of minimizing risk. If you have high returns and wonder why you returns are so much higher than standard investment funds its probably because you are here

How high could it go?

#Topics of discussion:

* Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks

* WDC Fundamentals

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community.

A little bit about myself for context:

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/555339dhob071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42585b1cfe4cf1c85eab62b0cc01791f5321f1e2

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",nh8f2j,PUBM DD #1

I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

This is not financial advice but...

Now that Tellurian (TELL) has crossed the 1bln market cap, you are ready to find out about what has the potential to be your biggest play this year.

Tellurian is a stock that‚Äôs been rattled by short sellers, whom the chairman Charif Souki despises and he‚Äôs been pretty vocal about it. The stock price tumbled 60% as a result of aggressive shorting since February and it appeared that the company isn‚Äôt going anywhere. 

However, they have recently repaid most of their debt and are about to start construction of their Driftwood LNG project this summer. They are said to be announcing commercial agreements over the next few weeks which is where the best part comes in‚Ä¶

If you have a browse through the options chain (https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tell/option-chain) you will notice the ridiculous open interest on Jan 22 calls with a strike price of‚Ä¶ 15usd!

It appears that insiders know that big volume contracts are coming and are betting on huge moves with the stock price coming back to its former glory. 

Combined with a significant short volume this has the potential to be a very explosive stock over the coming months.

Position: 9750 shares at 2.44usd 
[proof](https://ibb.co/NjcRRhw) 

TL;DR; People are betting on a huge move in TELL, you might want to get on board.",nhakjn,TELL - someone‚Äôs betting on a 6x move

This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let‚Äôs go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don‚Äôt need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there‚Äôs a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

Overall, I‚Äôm bullish and have over 30 call contracts expiring this July üöÄüöÄüöÄ",nhdnzi,Bull Cruise $CCL primed to explode üöÄüöÄüìàüöÄ

There is little difference in their lines of business at the moment, margins are similar, products are similar. There‚Äôs very little differentiation, he‚Äôll they‚Äôre in the same city. UWMC has had a better post-earnings period not because their top line YOY growth was so good or even indicative of something remotely possible to sustain moving forward, but really just because of the dividend and chest pounding against RKT.

I have a position in both, and before either camp starts screaming about how one is more revolutionary, or has better blah blah blah, realize that the only thing driving price action for either is public sentiment. UWMC declared a regular dividend while RKT only a special. 

Next week, either Jay Farner gets flashy (new dividend, massive auto rollout, something new) and starts publicly pushing back against Ishbia, or RKT continues downward. I think it‚Äôs 50/50 but looks ripe for anyone looking for a straddle yolo, with IV not as bad as it was before.

Put prices increases when there is more demand for them because people are fearful of future events and want to hedge their positions. Do you understand so far? 

On the opposite when everything's good in the market and nobody's fearful, put options are cheaper because most people aren't hedging they're position. You're still with me?

I think I'm actually mentally broken. Like forever. 

While the whole world was burning in 2020 I had multiple golden tickets come my way that I basically threw away.

Got assigned SOXL at (post-split) $4...sold for $6...could have sold for $45 a year later. ZERO reason not to hold, but I sold.

Had BB $15Cs I bought way OTM before it went to $25. 2000% gain...just looked at it, then the next day it tanked. NO reason.

Made OK $ on GME and then managed to snag 7 $100C's for ~$10...sold 3 of them for ~$50 for no reason. Was *just* about to hit sell at $245 on 3/10 when the big red dildo fucked me. Literally a matter of seconds...my finger was pressing the button. That's after getting screwed during the first rug pull.

I've thrown away $200k+ in gains like this. I somehow still more than doubled my account, but the amount left on the table with retarded moves like these has **really** broken me.

I might be able to get over it if it wasn't for the ""once in a lifetime"" aspect. 

There won't be another COVID. Ever. There won't be another GME. Ever. I doubt I'll ever be so lucky to be in the right place at the right time again...even /r/wsb is now very different than how it was when I was fortunate enough to stumble on it at that unique moment in history.

I could have come out the other side of Armageddon a decade closer to retirement with an amazing story to tell, instead I'm just a mediocre coulda-been with crushing regrets I'll carry with me the *rest of my life*.

The problem is now I can't focus on anything. What's the point? I have 0 motivation for work or even finding a different job. Watching that much profit evaporate makes everything else seem fake and distant. If I fucked up such easy layups so cluelessly, what else am I fucking up in life? Do I even deserve to ""win""? I don't feel like I'm even entitled to any more luck again ever. I bitched and moaned my whole life, and when the universe relented and rained down tendies, I threw them away.

Anyway, Siri, play Everlong...",,

I'm planning to continue doing weekly relative rotation analysis of the market, but wanted to create this mid week post to take a quick look at UWMC. Please let me know if another flair is more appropriate.

I'm not going to get into the financials, since plenty of solid DD has been done on that already. However, I did mention in my last post (analyzing the market sectors) that I would look into positions related to the real estate sector (XLRE).

My thought process here it to take a look at the short term momentum for this stock due to the recent positive earnings, great financials, positive future outlook, and upcoming June Ex-Div date.

Lets jump into it and make it quick...

Since there is a lot of talk regarding Russell inclusion, here is the RRG of UWMC again UWM:

**My Thoughts:**

Personally, the company has strong fundamentals. So, in combination with the momentum, I think its a decent ""buy"" (this is not professional financial advice).

I'm playing this 3 ways:

6/18 short put x 2 @ $7

7/16 long call x 5 @ $6

1100 shares @ $8.06

Edit 1: Silly me, I forgot to mention that a share buyback plan was approved which also contributes to the positive momentum.

What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either. 

Here is some better and more thought out DD:

6978,,2021-05-19 20:14:45,t3_ngftx1,,wallstreetbets,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",ngftx1,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Mr. Cramer..."

6981,,2021-05-19 20:51:00,t3_nggpql,,wallstreetbets,"I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D.

6983,,2021-05-19 21:25:26,t3_nghmhm,,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",nghmhm,$NUE is strong as steel. Buy the dips.

Petco earnings is tomorrow pre-market. But this also might be a potential candidate for a short squeeze.

Short sellers are gearing up for a bad quarter. For the last three days, the short float increased from 4 point-something Monday, 6.05 yesterday, and today it's at 8.75.

In addition, short interest is up to 35.2%

To top it off, there are hardly any shares available to short, though borrowing rate remains at only 1%. For the last five days there were no more than 100k shares left to short.

The average price target is $28, but if earnings goes better than expected, this could be the catalyst for something significantly bigger. Listen to your pets' beckoning calls, and keep this on your watch list!

6995,,2021-05-20 05:24:49,t3_ngrqqf,,wallstreetbets,"Some context: Cell carriers in the US have decided to stop the function of shared short codes (5-6 digit phone numbers) June 1. Shared short codes were the preferred means of SMS and MMS communication for B2C traffic. Short codes were free to lease in many cases, text messages were cheap, thousands of businesses could send from the same number, and throughput was incredibly high (lots of messages could be sent very fast).

The new policy enforced by the CTIA (The private club all major cell phone carriers are in) is that shared short codes are to be discontinued and replaced by dedicated short codes and A2P 10dlc (approved B2C traffic on 10-digit phone numbers). This means that every business/organization that wants to send texts must either apply for a dedicated short code or apply for a 10DLC. 

Dedicated short codes are the preferred choice for large corporations. They can handle large throughput and look good for the brand. However, they only cater to large corporations because they are thousands of dollars/year to lease. Turn around time for application is 4-6 weeks. Barrier to entry is high.

10DLC is the preferred choice for the smaller businesses since it's less expensive. But, it is still far more expensive than the shared short codes businesses are used to, requires application, and costs $50/mo in carrier and registration fees alone. Turn around time for application is less than a week. On top of fees, 10dlc isn't even fully ready. The Campaign Registry, the organization responsible for rolling out ""the new messaging standard"" for the CTIA, is still developing their API.

Enter Toll-free messaging. TF has 0 barrier to entry and can be issued to a business with SMS and MMS capabilities in seconds. It's the easiest and now the most cost-effective way to send commercial messages.

Conveniently, every major carrier announced this month (for the first time) that they will start collecting a $0.0025/message fee for every sms sent. They're ready for and expecting businesses to move to this method.

Who is Zipwhip: Zipwhip was given full reign over all TF traffic. Anyone in the US  that wants to send messages on TF codes uses Zipwhip in one way or another. They are a massive reseller that everyone is required to go through.

It was recently announced the Twilio plans on acquiring Zipwhip for $850M. Twilio is the leader is programmable messaging hands down. 

Honestly, there should be antitrust issues that arise and block the acquisition. If it goes through, Twilio owns the new world of business sms. Good chance regulators won't notice any issue. They'll miss the fact that businesses will be pressured into TF over their preferred solutions (dedicated short codes and A2P 10DLC) since it's unnecessarily complicated and expensive. TF is ready now and cheap.

TL;DR if Twilio successfully acquires Zipwhip, every small to medium sized business that wants to send texts will have to go through them. Every single one of them in the US.",ngrqqf,$TWLO stands to be the primary source for commercial text messaging

6998,,2021-05-20 08:25:07,t3_ngulnq,,wallstreetbets,"So just how big is **today's news about the initial success of the Sofusa technology**?

1st, this is a technology that aims at lymphatic delivery. 

**What does this mean?** Well, when trying to fight a disease, it's difficult to target the lymphatic system. Because of how it works and the fact that it is spread throughout our body. 

So there are MANY, MANY drugs out there that treat several conditions through the lymphatic system. But, because of what we just explained, those drugs sometimes don't work. They are not properly ""delivered"". They don't get to where they need to get to make the necessary interaction and solve the problem.

**Sorrento has developed a technology that can deliver drugs to where they actually need to go** in the lymphatic system. So this is definitely breakthrough technology. Other companies are aiming to find similar solutions. But we are definitely talking about very advanced bio-tech.

In this case, we have a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. This is a condition that worsens with time. It's very painful and limits the patient's movement. It's not very common, so we are talking about 1.5 million people in the USA and about 30 million worldwide. 

But remember, **the technology Sorrento is developing  will be able to deliver drugs treating many other diseases** related to the lymphatic system. So the market for Sofusa is very, very large.

The press release tells us Sofusa was tested on ""First Enbrel-Non-Responding"" patients. 

**What does this mean?** Patients who need the drug Enbrel and, even though they have not been taking the drug for long (it's a ""first"" for them) they are not responding to it. It isn't helping them. 

Now, Sofusa comes into play. It's job is to deliver Enbrel to the patient effectively. To ""take"" Enbrel to where it needs to go in the lymphatic system.. 

The 1st obvious advantage is that the drug wasn't helping and now helps. But there are other important advantages.

Since the drug is being carried to its targeted ""destination"" the dosage needed, diminishes. Because less is ""lost along the way"". This is important because many diseases related to the lymphatic system, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are chronic, lifelong conditions. Being able to administer less drugs really helps the patient. Now you have a drug that actually works, more potently, which reduces its dosage. All this thanks to Sorrento.

The press release points out an important factor: This is a trial on ONE type of drug/treatment. Other such trials testing the effectiveness of Sofusa are already taking place. Again, this is proof of the potentially huge market for this delivery system.

Just to get an idea, the release mentions anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. These are a type of drugs that inhibit the activity of certain proteins (they inhibit PD1 and CTLA4, which are types of proteins. By stopping their activity, they help in stopping the growth of cancer tumors). There are several drugs that fall under these categories and treat a wide variety of cancers. **Sofusa can potentially play a vital role in all these treatments**. 

This is like several companies developing apps while Sorrento is developing a new smartphone technology. Each app has its rightful use and market. But once the new smartphone is up and working, all apps will need it. So this technology has huge revenue implications. T**he fact we are hearing good news about it is HUGE**.

As for the results themselves: **The DAS28 test measures rheumatoid activity in 28 joints** in the patient's body. The joints might be swollen or tender (hurting).

This patient had a DAS28 score of 4.6, with 18 out of 28 joints compromised.  That is considered  moderate to high disease activity.  There are 4 levels of DAS 28 scores going from remission (the best) to high (the worst). So this patient was not in the worst shape going in, but pretty bad.

Using Sofusa to deliver the Enbrel drug, in just 4 weeks (this is a very short time for this type of disease!!) the results went from 4.6 to 3.0. The total amount of compromised joints, from 18 to 11. **That is a dramatic change**. The patient went from being somewhere between level 3 and 4, to being in the lower level 2, called ""low disease activity"", which indicates it's moving towards remission (the lowest level). For someone suffering from this condition, it's a real life changer. For the company selling Enbrel, it's a real market changer. And if it can equally help people with tumors, **Sofusa becomes a major therapeutic factor.** 

I hope investors understand this. **It's another major development in an already extremely promising pipeline** which is currently badly undervalued. If the price doesn't spike today by 10-15%, as it should, just from this news, it would be disappointing. 

But if you are long, today's price change isn't what matters the most. It‚Äôs the understanding that Sorrento / SRNE has ANOTHER ace in its hand!",ngulnq,How Big is SRNE news release about Sofusa success?

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC and its +23% run in the past week. A stock with a massive dividend. A stock trading with a very low P/E of and income growth of 4,200%.

So why is this stock still a buy and hold for me right now?

The CEO is positioning them to increase shareholder value, but also position the company to weather any reduction in the refi market. (65% of the business)

There are major catalysts that have been driving the increase in price that goes beyond the attention gained on WSB.

* Announced **NET earnings of $860M in the first quarter,** with huge margins.
* Reaffirmed a continued dividend, the next ex-dividend date is **6/9/2021**.
* Announced a **$300M stock buyback, representing as much as 40% of the free float** at the current prices.
* Russell index inclusion was missed last quarter due to confusion about their PREVIOUS status as a SPAC. It is expected that they will be reconsidered for Russell Index inclusions in the yearly reconstitution. While not the biggest catalyst, this is a sign of reputation and long-term stability for the stock. **The prelim list publishes 6/4/2021.**
* Creation of a jumbo mortgage product. The average loan origination in the market is \~410,000, indicating that the non-conforming section of the mortgage market is *exploding.* This is a very profitable sector of loan origination.

Other fundamentals driving a buy recommendation:

* Small float. 90M float, of which only about 60M is freely trading.
* This stock is not persistently pressured down quite as hard as others due to low share availability, but it appears based on the last two weeks it's trading the small waves of this stock to try to push it down under dangerous strike prices. A wave of positive sentiment could strangle this position in the stock. I don't have a Bloomberg terminal, but based on the evidence over the last several days, the indication is the 13.1% SI has grown.
* Exceptional open option interest for **tomorrow 5/21/2021.** The options expiring tomorrow have been documented elsewhere so I won't belabor them, but the open interest at the $9, and $10 strike represent almost 10% of the free float.
* Not a new startup, **they have been in this business since 1986**, making them almost as old as a fossil like me. They clearly survived the 2008 storm. This company isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

The cherry:

* **STILL forecasting growth in Q2**, whereas many of its competitors are not.

This post is NOT financial advice, but as someone who has ridden the waves of this stock since it was about $9, I see this position turning positive and the outlook through July for this position has high sentiment. Even if the mortgage market slows down as expected, I will hold these shares for years to come for the dividends and general stability of the organization.

My position 8000 shares @ 7.65 and 45x 6/18 8c. You can go stalk the fuck out of me if you want to see that I've been talking about this stock for some time and been saying the same thing about the strength and targets of their position since March. I am also the guy that tells you when you unintentionally reveal personal info on your yolo screenshots!

TLDR: UWMC should garner close attention for value investors looking for undervalued positions.

7009,,2021-05-20 13:28:43,t3_nh08j4,,wallstreetbets,"**Investment Thesis**

Overall, what makes MDXG a good buying opportunity right now is a combination of two factors.

* Number one is management‚Äôs miscommunication with the market. The market currently believes that wound care is the core business of MDXG, is not entirely aware of the potential of its biopharma pipeline and more specifically its Amniofix drug, and has priced the company based on this.¬†
* Number two is the huge potential of the Amniofix treatment and its ability to become the next blockbuster in the healthcare space after the conclusion of its phase 3 trial.

**Idea Summary**

MiMedx Group *(MDXG)* is a leading BioPharma and wound care business whose value has been drastically misunderstood by the market. Through drivers such as miscommunication from management about the company‚Äôs valued proposition as well as the lack of institutional investor coverage, the market currently believes that the majority of the company‚Äôs value sits in its low growth wound care business. In reality, its major competitive advantage is within its osteoarthritis drug Amniofix which has the potential to become the next blockbuster after it clears phase III clinical trials. A sum of the parts valuation was used to determine a minimum implied upside of at least 300%. Risks are discussed at the end.

**Business Overview**

MiMedx Group is a leading biopharma and advanced wound care business utilizing human placental tissues to develop products used in the healthcare sector. It processes placental tissues using its patented processes to produce allografts, which are tissues transplanted from one person to another for wound care and regeneration. These allografts are effective in healing difficult wounds because of the ability of the allograft cells to quickly associate with the cells of the patient, thereby taking part in the healing process, easing the ability of the body to close the wound, and speeding up the body‚Äôs regeneration process.

MDXG‚Äôs product offerings can be split into two business segments: wound care and biopharma (surgical solutions). Its flagship product Epifix and additional product Epicord fall under its wound care umbrella, and its flagship product Amniofix as well as additional products Amniocord, Amniofill, and Epiburn fall under its biopharma umbrella. The wound care products service the broad wound care industry, targeting specifically chronic wounds. The biopharma product line is more specific, with the flagship treatment Amniofix targeting knee osteoarthritis in specific.¬†

MDXG sells through direct sales, sales agents, and distributors in the United States. This past quarter, 95% of its sales were direct to customers such as healthcare professionals and facilities.¬†

**Internal Analysis**

The past 3 years have not been ideal for MDXG. Its revenues began to dip in 2018 around the time of their accounting scandal, the growth went from 40% in 2018, to 11% in 2019, and is currently around -16%. This sent their stock price tumbling from $16 USD to lows of almost $1 USD, though it is currently trading at $9 with new updates on their biopharma pipeline.

Their gross margin has stayed very high, around 80% while their EBITDA margins have dropped over the years. Though it wasn‚Äôt explicitly disclosed, a large part of this drop in EBITDA margins has been attributed to a temporary increase in legal fees due to the litigation MDXG has faced this past year. Its decreased volume may have also suppressed margins as the number of wound care treatments in hospitals significantly dropped during COVID-19.¬†

The company‚Äôs cash balance is sitting at a very high level of 84 mm. This is in large part due to its recent capital raise, which happened to be strongly criticized by one of MDXG‚Äôs activist investors, Prescience Point Capital (discussed in detail later).

**External Analysis**

*Wound Care Market*

The global wound care market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% from 2021 to 2028. This has been driven by the aging population and rising rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Wound care products are increasingly being used to prevent and surgical site infections.¬†

Though the overall market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% the specific advanced product segment which includes products such as those of MDXG‚Äôs which target chronic and non-healing wounds, is projected to grow much faster than 4.1%.¬†

The wound care market is relatively fragmented, with large players such as Integra LifeSciences, 3M, Johnson & Johnson, and Medtronic competing to gain the most market share. MDXG‚Äôs direct competition for its allograft advanced wound care treatments include Organogenesis, Axogen, Mediwound, and Vericel.¬†

Organogenesis is currently in the lead in this niche market, and while MDXG reported an 11% YoY decline in sales in 2020 (which has already been factored into the current price), Organogenesis reported a 30% increase. This is evident when comparing the stock performance of both companies over the past year (figure 1)

*Osteoarthritis Therapy Market*

91 million U.S. adults have arthritis, 20M have knee OA, and \~32 million per year are currently treated for plantar fasciitis, which is specifically targeted by MDXG‚Äôs Amniofix drug. There are very few FDA approved treatments for knee OA and plantar fasciitis, and those that exist have low efficacy and many drawbacks. Amniofix is currently the only treatment of its nature in phase 3 clinical trials that have posted very positive results in both company and independent trials, has been used off-label by >100K patients with zero severe adverse effects, and consistently demonstrates a significant reduction in pain as reported by patients. In addition, Amniofix has an RMAT (regenerative medicine advanced therapy) designation granted by the FDA which allows for MDXG to benefit from an expedited approval process from the FDA.

*Management Miscommunication*

The current market opinion of MDXG has been blurred by the miscommunication from company management whose goals do not align with maximizing shareholder value. This is largely due to the fact that EW healthcare, a private equity firm, has 33% representation on the board as a result of its 17% stake. From a corporate finance perspective, a private equity firm‚Äôs interests do not generally tend to align with those of public shareholders. Their influence has been exacerbated by the fact that there are no large institutional holdings in MDXG as of yet other than Prescience Point, and there has been minimal coverage on the stock leading to the market‚Äôs opinion on the company being heavily skewed by management communications.¬†

MDXG‚Äôs current growth strategy is focused on roll-ups in the wound care space. This is very characteristic of a private equity playbook, and goes alongside EW‚Äôs historical acquisitions. As was mentioned in the external analysis, the wound care space is growing at a slow rate of \~4.1%, however MDXG has lost significant market share to Organogenesis. Management has failed to realize that the current value driver of the business is within its biopharma line and not its wound care line, yet has continually communicated to shareholders that it believes it is in fact wound care and it is going to continue investing in growing within the industry.

Prescience Point Capital, an activist investor group which has advocated for change in MDXG's communication strategy, has supported the fact that MDXG‚Äôs communications have been focused on the wrong industry. At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, the potential for the drug Amniofix was drastically undersold and much time was spent convincing investors that the core business is in wound care. The 3.6% decline in shares two days after the conference illustrates how effective this strategy was.¬†

There has been strong opposition from MDXG‚Äôs board of directors to Prescience Point‚Äôs activist efforts. In a shareholder letter in early May, prior to their annual meeting, the company communicated that they believe the wound care and regenerative medicine direction being followed now is ideal. They stated that the activist investor does not understand pharmaceutical company disclosure and were advocating for speculative actions themselves though Prescience‚Äôs report discusses the opposite, with them outlining how EW‚Äôs influence on the board of directors is shifting the company‚Äôs focus away from maximizing shareholder value.

*Amniofix*

As mentioned in the external analysis, there is currently no other treatment, either in development or on the market, as effective as Amniofix in treating knee OA and also just as safe. Most recently, at its Q1 earnings call, MDXG CEO shared positive results from the phase IIb prospective trial of the treatment. There was a statistically significant reduction in VAS (visual analog score) for pain and an improvement in the foot function index score. There were also no serious adverse events during this clinical trial. Amniofix is currently in phase III trials, and MDXG believes they are on target to meet all criteria needed to find a biologics license application (BLA) so that the treatment can be introduced to the general public. MDXG is aiming to file their BLA in the first half of 2022, meaning that within a year this blockbuster treatment could be on the market, and given the feedback so far from clinical trials as well as the RMAT designation, it is highly likely.

A Prescience Point market capture analysis estimated that the treatment would bring in $4,050 million of annual sales. This is \~8 times higher than the current sales brought in through wound care. One year ago it would have been prudent to not entirely incorporate this into the share price, however today with clinical trials nearing completion and MDXG‚Äôs new RMAT designation, the likelihood of approval is much higher.

**Valuation**

From a valuation point of view, a quick sum of the parts analysis is the most ideal given the two different business lines of MDXG. A more in-depth DCF can be created once more cost information is provided from MDXG after the conclusion of clinical trials.

Shares outstanding of 109.8 mm, total debt of 51.8 mm, and total cash of 84.7mm were used to convert from enterprise value to equity value. The current implied upside was calculated using the current price of $9.46.

*Wound Care Valuation*

MDXG‚Äôs FY 2021 sales guidance assumed $255 mm to $270 mm in revenue from the wound care segment. Different points in this revenue ranged were used for the low, base, and high cases of the valuation. An EV/Revenue multiple was used to calculate implied enterprise value. The comparables analysis shown in figure 2 illustrated the median multiples derived from the analysis done using the aforementioned list of MDXG‚Äôs competitors. A median multiple of 5.3x was used. The median was used and not marked down because the gross margin and UFCF yield of MDXG is in-line with all competitors. Though the EBIDTA multiple was lower, the similar yield and gross margins indicate that company performance is relatively the same. In addition, litigation expenses factored into the lower EBIDTA multiples and thus it is not indicative of recurring performance.

Based on the revenue multiples, implied share values for the wound care segment range between $12.0 and $12.8.

**Wound Care Equity Value**

**Biopharma Valuation**

Prescience Point estimated annual revenues from Amniofix through using the market capture method. The total market size (annual knee OA injections) was estimated, and a capture percentage was applied to determine the annual number of patients receiving the Amniofix injection. Prescience assumed 1.5 injections per year but to be more conservative in this valuation 1 was used. Price per injection and FDA approval probability varied by the cases and were used to adjust the EV/Rev multiple downwards. Overall, an implied share value range between $25.4 and $57.1 was calculated for this segment.

https://preview.redd.it/we0pw4jm1a071.png?width=611&format=png&auto=webp&s=567d19cc5acc59acbe552a2afcf09789c80866ff

**Biopharma Equity Value**

Overall, the total implied share price ranges between $37.43 to $69.81. As more information regarding Amniofix comes out including the price of manufacturing, different multiples can be used to fine-tune the analysis.

https://preview.redd.it/a8035yfo1a071.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=12e0f9a041e326b505bfda25304261367c651406

**Risks**

1. Given the high influence EW healthcare has on the board of directors, there is potential for more value to describe acquisitions such as that of stability biologics, which was bought for 10 million and sold for 3.5 million 3 years later. If such a trend continues, the value of MDXG‚Äôs wound care business can dramatically decrease, which will hurt the share pierce
2. The FDA approval of Amniofix is a large driver of the valuation calculated. There is a large risk that the FDA will not approve the treatment, however, with the RMAT designation in place and positive results from the first two phases of clinical trials, the odds are strongly in the favour of the approval at the current point in time.

For those who don't know, $EEM - or the iShares Emerging Markets ETF - is comprised of stocks from developing nations, with a **ton** of room to grow. These countries **will** all catch up soon, it's only a matter of time. This is one of the many reasons I find this setup especially interesting.

Here are the top holdings:

[$EEM Holdings \(By Country\)](https://preview.redd.it/zh7nwb2hfa071.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cb2749a2c7d6c7f548ad89a3f9a746b56d2273)

Next, let's dig into the charts -

Chart 1: **Max Monthly (\~16 Years)**

[$EEM Max Monthly](https://preview.redd.it/ylknrqzhea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=91ee9718b89c47744e6f68224a133c48c7bcfc6f)

Here you can see we have a **symmetrical triangle** pattern that dates back to late 2007. In technical analysis, the longer the pattern has been building, the more significant the breakout will be. Subsequently - you can imagine the magnitude a pattern like this has.

When making new all time highs I like to look for psychological resistances. As a result - logical targets for this pattern are **75.00, 100.00.** Sounds simple, but it works in practice. Keep in mind - something like this will take **3 - 5 years** to play out. This is a position trade.

In order for this breakout to stay valid - we need to continue getting monthly closes above **50.85.** You can see we've pretty much gone perfectly sideways since breaking out for **4 months** now.

This is **bullish -** moving sideways in a higher range is always biased to the upside (except in special situations with certain reversal patterns). Not only that, but we've been forming an interesting setup on the next chart I will show you all -

Chart 2: **1 Year 1 Day**

[$EEM 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/7hy7wbqeea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8102c5b1f0e92c02260cfccc6b8d77eafea8035d)

On this chart - you can make much more sense of those 4 months of sideways. We are actually working on a large **falling wedge** \- which is a bullish continuation pattern. The breakout point for this is sitting around **54.37** as I am writing this (5/20/2021).

Upon breaking this (ignoring the previous chart) - we would target **54.94, 56.49, 57.32, 60.00, 65.00.** That would be if there was no setup on the monthly chart. Each of these are resistances we could stop and consolidate at. I like to scale in after breaking each resistance. Scale into winners and cut losers fast. A break from a pattern like this would probably take **3 - 6 months** to play out.

I also want to note that **MASSIVE** increase in volume on 3/26. Generally - an uptick on volume when price is doing what you want it to is always a plus. But one like that is very intriguing - on a huge green candle too. My guess would be someone loaded their bags there (or a group of players).

And... **that's it.** Keep it simple. Those are often the best setups.

***TL;DR -***

$EEM has a big pattern - broke out 4 months ago just chopping sideways waiting for the move to happen.

Price targets **75.00, 100.00**

Stop out below **50.87** monthly close

Timeframe **3-5 years**

It also has a smaller pattern above that one - which breaks out above **54.37** and has a shorter time horizon.

Price targets **60.00, 65.00**

Stop out if we close back inside

Timeframe **3-6 months**

***Positions -***

10% of my long term portfolio is in emerging markets ETFs and,

August **55c @ 0.91** \- Will always roll these back before they get below 60 DTE - Will scale in heavily after the smaller pattern breaks out

\- Research coming out of John Hopkins University is suggesting that the use of Psilocybin is the most effective drug ever tested as a remedy for depression, anxiety, and PTSD. As the United States is currently under crisis in its battle against mental illness, these results are too impressive to ignore, even if it may need to overcome pressures from big pharma interest groups that seek to quell the expansion of this research.

\- These drugs have been extremely effective in treating addiction -- particularly alcohol and nicotine. Considering the government expenditure on the opioid crisis, once this proves to be an effective treatment, the government will expedite the medicinal legalization of the substances that MNMD has been treating/experimenting with.

\- Veterans, the most respected occupational category (statistically,) have begun launching advocacy groups for the widespread medicinal legalization of these substances due to their effectiveness against PTSD. These therapeutic measures have contributed to the plummeting of suicide rates (those treated w/ psilocybin vs. control group.) The Biden administration will have to choose ethics and reason over the suffering of veterans (former government employees) which I anticipate that they will given mounting pressure due to the effectiveness of these treatments.

&#x200B;

Does this hinge on expected earnings in the long-run ... certainly!

&#x200B;

But the effectiveness of this research is undeniable and can no longer be overlooked ... because of new cultural acceptance of these alternative treatments the government's hand will be forced in legalize, or otherwise be responsible for mental illness and addiction -- all of which could be treated and cured.

If you aren't familiar with the efficient frontier, what it tries to find is the *mean-variance portfolio.* This type of model deals with portfolio management / optimization. In terms of the efficient frontier you are trying to find the best portfolio allocation weights that give you the best risk adjusted returns. 

**In simple words:** you give it stocks and it tells you the best percentage holdings

I recently built an app on some python code that does this sort of optimization. There is no programming required to use the app. When running the app it will give two portfolios, minimum variance, and maximized sharpe (same as mean-variance, mean-markowitz). Minimum variance will tell you the least riskiest holding strategy (green), and max sharpe will give you the best reward-for-risk holding (red).

I used around 100,000 simulations, and 10Y of adjusted close data. 

The reason why I bring this up is because it does two things. The first is that it promotes portfolio diversification, which I know is pretty uncommon here. Also it finds the most aggressive returns in terms of minimizing risk. If you have high returns and wonder why you returns are so much higher than standard investment funds its probably because you are here

Yah you may good returns, you are probably taking on more risk than what you are getting in return.

How high could it go? Well If we take a look at the graph below, we can see that SPCE peaked at around 60 bucks  back in February in ANTICIPATION for the previous test flight which was delayed until May for safety reasons (They had some problems with electromagnetic interference which is fixed now).

So if the test flight actually happens on the 22nd, then could be really big boom. Currently the price is around 18-19 bucks, so it's an absolute steal in my opinion, but there is always the risk that some shit fucks up and the test flight is delayed even further, in which case I will have to sell the house.

And before any of you autistic fucks say that SpaceX is better, just keep in mind that Virgin Galactic is playing a whole different game. SpaceX is trying to go to Mars, and Virgin Galactic is just trying to do some space tourism. Also keep in mind that Virgin Galactic was founded 2 whole years after SpaceX, so SpaceX has had a bit of a head start.

* Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks

* WDC Fundamentals

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

I believe the technology will allow for a more personal approach in the field of medicine, and should not be viewed solely as a research-based company.  

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community.

A little bit about myself for context:

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/555339dhob071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42585b1cfe4cf1c85eab62b0cc01791f5321f1e2

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",nh8f2j,PUBM DD #1

7033,,2021-05-20 19:09:28,t3_nh8q8x,,wallstreetbets," So this is the first time I've ever played around with options and I'm probably doing it in a dumb way but get that's more fun for you guys to watch. I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let‚Äôs go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don‚Äôt need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there‚Äôs a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

UWMC has had a better post-earnings period not because their top line YOY growth was so good or even indicative of something remotely possible to sustain moving forward, but really just because of the dividend and chest pounding against RKT.

I have a position in both, and before either camp starts screaming about how one is more revolutionary, or has better blah blah blah, realize that the only thing driving price action for either is public sentiment. UWMC declared a regular dividend while RKT only a special. 

Next week, either Jay Farner gets flashy (new dividend, massive auto rollout, something new) and starts publicly pushing back against Ishbia, or RKT continues downward. I think it‚Äôs 50/50 but looks ripe for anyone looking for a straddle yolo, with IV not as bad as it was before.

It might be to their advantage to do so because they are able to profit off of the availability of COMEX -- but at what price?  
In other words, saving COMEX yet again may be becoming just too *expensive* for JPM's bean counters/risk managers.  
Or maybe they simply don't have the available unencumbered silver to do this with any longer.  
JPM and their billion ounce mountain of silver may be a paper tiger.

Lets dign in !

**Comex silver warehouse .... another 1,000,000 oz is OUT OF THE VAULT, 43,000,000 oz is gone since the silverbacks arrived. This time it is all HSBC bank. And what did big powerful JP Morgan do? Nothing!! Maybe all their silver eligible is spoken for.** 

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either. 

Here is some better and more thought out DD:

7349,,2021-05-19 20:14:45,t3_ngftx1,,wallstreetbets,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",ngftx1,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Mr. Cramer..."

Sector rotation, tech bubble fear, jump in 10-year treasury rate marked the beginning of inflation fear. And mistrust in FED that JPOW will not raise interest rate until at least 2023.

Big tech's earnings absolutely destroyed estimates but sell side thinks it's due to lock down and people will rely on tech less once things open up. It's a consistent pattern that all the gains made after earning erode overnight or in a few trading session as if the good earning did not happen. 

At the same time, the indexes are still hover around all time high. Remember how excited this sub was when SPY edging $400 and we are now still at $410. Meanwhile small growth stocks have 5% - 10% up and down days regularly and overall down 30% - 50% from ATH. 

The pre-market can be deeply red and the day can end slightly green or close to it like today.  Market can reverse anytime in any direction like playing Uno reverse card. 

The world is still hella messy. Fear of second covid wave in Europe, Asia, and even America. Big government wants to spend trillions of dollars. More spending and more stimulus so the market should go up right? Wait a second, how about inflation? 

Same information, mixed understanding, and complete opposite decision on the market. So far, the sell side seems winning but the market seems to be really confused on where it should go.",ngg05f,Market is in a hella messy state and only certain thing is high volatility

7352,,2021-05-19 20:51:00,t3_nggpql,,wallstreetbets,"I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

7354,,2021-05-19 21:25:26,t3_nghmhm,,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",nghmhm,$NUE is strong as steel. Buy the dips.

Petco earnings is tomorrow pre-market. But this also might be a potential candidate for a short squeeze.

Short sellers are gearing up for a bad quarter. For the last three days, the short float increased from 4 point-something Monday, 6.05 yesterday, and today it's at 8.75.

In addition, short interest is up to 35.2%

To top it off, there are hardly any shares available to short, though borrowing rate remains at only 1%. For the last five days there were no more than 100k shares left to short.

The average price target is $28, but if earnings goes better than expected, this could be the catalyst for something significantly bigger. Listen to your pets' beckoning calls, and keep this on your watch list!

7366,,2021-05-20 05:24:49,t3_ngrqqf,,wallstreetbets,"Some context: Cell carriers in the US have decided to stop the function of shared short codes (5-6 digit phone numbers) June 1. Shared short codes were the preferred means of SMS and MMS communication for B2C traffic. Short codes were free to lease in many cases, text messages were cheap, thousands of businesses could send from the same number, and throughput was incredibly high (lots of messages could be sent very fast).

The new policy enforced by the CTIA (The private club all major cell phone carriers are in) is that shared short codes are to be discontinued and replaced by dedicated short codes and A2P 10dlc (approved B2C traffic on 10-digit phone numbers). This means that every business/organization that wants to send texts must either apply for a dedicated short code or apply for a 10DLC. 

Dedicated short codes are the preferred choice for large corporations. They can handle large throughput and look good for the brand. However, they only cater to large corporations because they are thousands of dollars/year to lease. Turn around time for application is 4-6 weeks. Barrier to entry is high.

10DLC is the preferred choice for the smaller businesses since it's less expensive. But, it is still far more expensive than the shared short codes businesses are used to, requires application, and costs $50/mo in carrier and registration fees alone. Turn around time for application is less than a week. On top of fees, 10dlc isn't even fully ready. The Campaign Registry, the organization responsible for rolling out ""the new messaging standard"" for the CTIA, is still developing their API.

Enter Toll-free messaging. TF has 0 barrier to entry and can be issued to a business with SMS and MMS capabilities in seconds. It's the easiest and now the most cost-effective way to send commercial messages.

Conveniently, every major carrier announced this month (for the first time) that they will start collecting a $0.0025/message fee for every sms sent. They're ready for and expecting businesses to move to this method.

Who is Zipwhip: Zipwhip was given full reign over all TF traffic. Anyone in the US  that wants to send messages on TF codes uses Zipwhip in one way or another. They are a massive reseller that everyone is required to go through.

It was recently announced the Twilio plans on acquiring Zipwhip for $850M. Twilio is the leader is programmable messaging hands down. 

Honestly, there should be antitrust issues that arise and block the acquisition. If it goes through, Twilio owns the new world of business sms. Good chance regulators won't notice any issue. They'll miss the fact that businesses will be pressured into TF over their preferred solutions (dedicated short codes and A2P 10DLC) since it's unnecessarily complicated and expensive. TF is ready now and cheap.

TL;DR if Twilio successfully acquires Zipwhip, every small to medium sized business that wants to send texts will have to go through them. Every single one of them in the US.",ngrqqf,$TWLO stands to be the primary source for commercial text messaging

7369,,2021-05-20 08:25:07,t3_ngulnq,,wallstreetbets,"So just how big is **today's news about the initial success of the Sofusa technology**?

1st, this is a technology that aims at lymphatic delivery. 

**What does this mean?** Well, when trying to fight a disease, it's difficult to target the lymphatic system. Because of how it works and the fact that it is spread throughout our body. 

So there are MANY, MANY drugs out there that treat several conditions through the lymphatic system. But, because of what we just explained, those drugs sometimes don't work. They are not properly ""delivered"". They don't get to where they need to get to make the necessary interaction and solve the problem.

**Sorrento has developed a technology that can deliver drugs to where they actually need to go** in the lymphatic system. So this is definitely breakthrough technology. Other companies are aiming to find similar solutions. But we are definitely talking about very advanced bio-tech.

In this case, we have a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. This is a condition that worsens with time. It's very painful and limits the patient's movement. It's not very common, so we are talking about 1.5 million people in the USA and about 30 million worldwide. 

But remember, **the technology Sorrento is developing  will be able to deliver drugs treating many other diseases** related to the lymphatic system. So the market for Sofusa is very, very large.

The press release tells us Sofusa was tested on ""First Enbrel-Non-Responding"" patients. 

**What does this mean?** Patients who need the drug Enbrel and, even though they have not been taking the drug for long (it's a ""first"" for them) they are not responding to it. It isn't helping them. 

Now, Sofusa comes into play. It's job is to deliver Enbrel to the patient effectively. To ""take"" Enbrel to where it needs to go in the lymphatic system.. 

The 1st obvious advantage is that the drug wasn't helping and now helps. But there are other important advantages.

Since the drug is being carried to its targeted ""destination"" the dosage needed, diminishes. Because less is ""lost along the way"". This is important because many diseases related to the lymphatic system, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are chronic, lifelong conditions. Being able to administer less drugs really helps the patient. Now you have a drug that actually works, more potently, which reduces its dosage. All this thanks to Sorrento.

The press release points out an important factor: This is a trial on ONE type of drug/treatment. Other such trials testing the effectiveness of Sofusa are already taking place. Again, this is proof of the potentially huge market for this delivery system.

Just to get an idea, the release mentions anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. These are a type of drugs that inhibit the activity of certain proteins (they inhibit PD1 and CTLA4, which are types of proteins. By stopping their activity, they help in stopping the growth of cancer tumors). There are several drugs that fall under these categories and treat a wide variety of cancers. **Sofusa can potentially play a vital role in all these treatments**. 

This is like several companies developing apps while Sorrento is developing a new smartphone technology. Each app has its rightful use and market. But once the new smartphone is up and working, all apps will need it. So this technology has huge revenue implications. T**he fact we are hearing good news about it is HUGE**.

As for the results themselves: **The DAS28 test measures rheumatoid activity in 28 joints** in the patient's body. The joints might be swollen or tender (hurting).

This patient had a DAS28 score of 4.6, with 18 out of 28 joints compromised.  That is considered  moderate to high disease activity.  There are 4 levels of DAS 28 scores going from remission (the best) to high (the worst). So this patient was not in the worst shape going in, but pretty bad.

Using Sofusa to deliver the Enbrel drug, in just 4 weeks (this is a very short time for this type of disease!!) the results went from 4.6 to 3.0. The total amount of compromised joints, from 18 to 11. **That is a dramatic change**. The patient went from being somewhere between level 3 and 4, to being in the lower level 2, called ""low disease activity"", which indicates it's moving towards remission (the lowest level). For someone suffering from this condition, it's a real life changer. For the company selling Enbrel, it's a real market changer. And if it can equally help people with tumors, **Sofusa becomes a major therapeutic factor.** 

I hope investors understand this. **It's another major development in an already extremely promising pipeline** which is currently badly undervalued. If the price doesn't spike today by 10-15%, as it should, just from this news, it would be disappointing. 

But if you are long, today's price change isn't what matters the most. It‚Äôs the understanding that Sorrento / SRNE has ANOTHER ace in its hand!",ngulnq,How Big is SRNE news release about Sofusa success?

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC and its +23% run in the past week. A stock with a massive dividend. A stock trading with a very low P/E of and income growth of 4,200%.

So why is this stock still a buy and hold for me right now?

The CEO is positioning them to increase shareholder value, but also position the company to weather any reduction in the refi market. (65% of the business)

There are major catalysts that have been driving the increase in price that goes beyond the attention gained on WSB.

* Announced **NET earnings of $860M in the first quarter,** with huge margins.
* Reaffirmed a continued dividend, the next ex-dividend date is **6/9/2021**.
* Announced a **$300M stock buyback, representing as much as 40% of the free float** at the current prices.
* Russell index inclusion was missed last quarter due to confusion about their PREVIOUS status as a SPAC. It is expected that they will be reconsidered for Russell Index inclusions in the yearly reconstitution. While not the biggest catalyst, this is a sign of reputation and long-term stability for the stock. **The prelim list publishes 6/4/2021.**
* Creation of a jumbo mortgage product. The average loan origination in the market is \~410,000, indicating that the non-conforming section of the mortgage market is *exploding.* This is a very profitable sector of loan origination.

Other fundamentals driving a buy recommendation:

* Small float. 90M float, of which only about 60M is freely trading.
* This stock is not persistently pressured down quite as hard as others due to low share availability, but it appears based on the last two weeks it's trading the small waves of this stock to try to push it down under dangerous strike prices. A wave of positive sentiment could strangle this position in the stock. I don't have a Bloomberg terminal, but based on the evidence over the last several days, the indication is the 13.1% SI has grown.
* Exceptional open option interest for **tomorrow 5/21/2021.** The options expiring tomorrow have been documented elsewhere so I won't belabor them, but the open interest at the $9, and $10 strike represent almost 10% of the free float.
* Not a new startup, **they have been in this business since 1986**, making them almost as old as a fossil like me. They clearly survived the 2008 storm. This company isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

The cherry:

* **STILL forecasting growth in Q2**, whereas many of its competitors are not.

This post is NOT financial advice, but as someone who has ridden the waves of this stock since it was about $9, I see this position turning positive and the outlook through July for this position has high sentiment. Even if the mortgage market slows down as expected, I will hold these shares for years to come for the dividends and general stability of the organization.

My position 8000 shares @ 7.65 and 45x 6/18 8c. You can go stalk the fuck out of me if you want to see that I've been talking about this stock for some time and been saying the same thing about the strength and targets of their position since March. I am also the guy that tells you when you unintentionally reveal personal info on your yolo screenshots!

TLDR: UWMC should garner close attention for value investors looking for undervalued positions.

7380,,2021-05-20 13:28:43,t3_nh08j4,,wallstreetbets,"**Investment Thesis**

Overall, what makes MDXG a good buying opportunity right now is a combination of two factors.

* Number one is management‚Äôs miscommunication with the market. The market currently believes that wound care is the core business of MDXG, is not entirely aware of the potential of its biopharma pipeline and more specifically its Amniofix drug, and has priced the company based on this.¬†
* Number two is the huge potential of the Amniofix treatment and its ability to become the next blockbuster in the healthcare space after the conclusion of its phase 3 trial.

**Idea Summary**

MiMedx Group *(MDXG)* is a leading BioPharma and wound care business whose value has been drastically misunderstood by the market. Through drivers such as miscommunication from management about the company‚Äôs valued proposition as well as the lack of institutional investor coverage, the market currently believes that the majority of the company‚Äôs value sits in its low growth wound care business. In reality, its major competitive advantage is within its osteoarthritis drug Amniofix which has the potential to become the next blockbuster after it clears phase III clinical trials. A sum of the parts valuation was used to determine a minimum implied upside of at least 300%. Risks are discussed at the end.

**Business Overview**

MiMedx Group is a leading biopharma and advanced wound care business utilizing human placental tissues to develop products used in the healthcare sector. It processes placental tissues using its patented processes to produce allografts, which are tissues transplanted from one person to another for wound care and regeneration. These allografts are effective in healing difficult wounds because of the ability of the allograft cells to quickly associate with the cells of the patient, thereby taking part in the healing process, easing the ability of the body to close the wound, and speeding up the body‚Äôs regeneration process.

MDXG‚Äôs product offerings can be split into two business segments: wound care and biopharma (surgical solutions). Its flagship product Epifix and additional product Epicord fall under its wound care umbrella, and its flagship product Amniofix as well as additional products Amniocord, Amniofill, and Epiburn fall under its biopharma umbrella. The wound care products service the broad wound care industry, targeting specifically chronic wounds. The biopharma product line is more specific, with the flagship treatment Amniofix targeting knee osteoarthritis in specific.¬†

MDXG sells through direct sales, sales agents, and distributors in the United States. This past quarter, 95% of its sales were direct to customers such as healthcare professionals and facilities.¬†

**Internal Analysis**

The past 3 years have not been ideal for MDXG. Its revenues began to dip in 2018 around the time of their accounting scandal, the growth went from 40% in 2018, to 11% in 2019, and is currently around -16%. This sent their stock price tumbling from $16 USD to lows of almost $1 USD, though it is currently trading at $9 with new updates on their biopharma pipeline.

Their gross margin has stayed very high, around 80% while their EBITDA margins have dropped over the years. Though it wasn‚Äôt explicitly disclosed, a large part of this drop in EBITDA margins has been attributed to a temporary increase in legal fees due to the litigation MDXG has faced this past year. Its decreased volume may have also suppressed margins as the number of wound care treatments in hospitals significantly dropped during COVID-19.¬†

The company‚Äôs cash balance is sitting at a very high level of 84 mm. This is in large part due to its recent capital raise, which happened to be strongly criticized by one of MDXG‚Äôs activist investors, Prescience Point Capital (discussed in detail later).

**External Analysis**

*Wound Care Market*

The global wound care market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% from 2021 to 2028. This has been driven by the aging population and rising rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Wound care products are increasingly being used to prevent and surgical site infections.¬†

Though the overall market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% the specific advanced product segment which includes products such as those of MDXG‚Äôs which target chronic and non-healing wounds, is projected to grow much faster than 4.1%.¬†

The wound care market is relatively fragmented, with large players such as Integra LifeSciences, 3M, Johnson & Johnson, and Medtronic competing to gain the most market share. MDXG‚Äôs direct competition for its allograft advanced wound care treatments include Organogenesis, Axogen, Mediwound, and Vericel.¬†

Organogenesis is currently in the lead in this niche market, and while MDXG reported an 11% YoY decline in sales in 2020 (which has already been factored into the current price), Organogenesis reported a 30% increase. This is evident when comparing the stock performance of both companies over the past year (figure 1)

*Osteoarthritis Therapy Market*

91 million U.S. adults have arthritis, 20M have knee OA, and \~32 million per year are currently treated for plantar fasciitis, which is specifically targeted by MDXG‚Äôs Amniofix drug. There are very few FDA approved treatments for knee OA and plantar fasciitis, and those that exist have low efficacy and many drawbacks. Amniofix is currently the only treatment of its nature in phase 3 clinical trials that have posted very positive results in both company and independent trials, has been used off-label by >100K patients with zero severe adverse effects, and consistently demonstrates a significant reduction in pain as reported by patients. In addition, Amniofix has an RMAT (regenerative medicine advanced therapy) designation granted by the FDA which allows for MDXG to benefit from an expedited approval process from the FDA.

*Management Miscommunication*

The current market opinion of MDXG has been blurred by the miscommunication from company management whose goals do not align with maximizing shareholder value. This is largely due to the fact that EW healthcare, a private equity firm, has 33% representation on the board as a result of its 17% stake. From a corporate finance perspective, a private equity firm‚Äôs interests do not generally tend to align with those of public shareholders. Their influence has been exacerbated by the fact that there are no large institutional holdings in MDXG as of yet other than Prescience Point, and there has been minimal coverage on the stock leading to the market‚Äôs opinion on the company being heavily skewed by management communications.¬†

MDXG‚Äôs current growth strategy is focused on roll-ups in the wound care space. This is very characteristic of a private equity playbook, and goes alongside EW‚Äôs historical acquisitions. As was mentioned in the external analysis, the wound care space is growing at a slow rate of \~4.1%, however MDXG has lost significant market share to Organogenesis. Management has failed to realize that the current value driver of the business is within its biopharma line and not its wound care line, yet has continually communicated to shareholders that it believes it is in fact wound care and it is going to continue investing in growing within the industry.

Prescience Point Capital, an activist investor group which has advocated for change in MDXG's communication strategy, has supported the fact that MDXG‚Äôs communications have been focused on the wrong industry. At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, the potential for the drug Amniofix was drastically undersold and much time was spent convincing investors that the core business is in wound care. The 3.6% decline in shares two days after the conference illustrates how effective this strategy was.¬†

There has been strong opposition from MDXG‚Äôs board of directors to Prescience Point‚Äôs activist efforts. In a shareholder letter in early May, prior to their annual meeting, the company communicated that they believe the wound care and regenerative medicine direction being followed now is ideal. They stated that the activist investor does not understand pharmaceutical company disclosure and were advocating for speculative actions themselves though Prescience‚Äôs report discusses the opposite, with them outlining how EW‚Äôs influence on the board of directors is shifting the company‚Äôs focus away from maximizing shareholder value.

*Amniofix*

As mentioned in the external analysis, there is currently no other treatment, either in development or on the market, as effective as Amniofix in treating knee OA and also just as safe. Most recently, at its Q1 earnings call, MDXG CEO shared positive results from the phase IIb prospective trial of the treatment. There was a statistically significant reduction in VAS (visual analog score) for pain and an improvement in the foot function index score. There were also no serious adverse events during this clinical trial. Amniofix is currently in phase III trials, and MDXG believes they are on target to meet all criteria needed to find a biologics license application (BLA) so that the treatment can be introduced to the general public. MDXG is aiming to file their BLA in the first half of 2022, meaning that within a year this blockbuster treatment could be on the market, and given the feedback so far from clinical trials as well as the RMAT designation, it is highly likely.

A Prescience Point market capture analysis estimated that the treatment would bring in $4,050 million of annual sales. This is \~8 times higher than the current sales brought in through wound care. One year ago it would have been prudent to not entirely incorporate this into the share price, however today with clinical trials nearing completion and MDXG‚Äôs new RMAT designation, the likelihood of approval is much higher.

**Valuation**

From a valuation point of view, a quick sum of the parts analysis is the most ideal given the two different business lines of MDXG. A more in-depth DCF can be created once more cost information is provided from MDXG after the conclusion of clinical trials.

Shares outstanding of 109.8 mm, total debt of 51.8 mm, and total cash of 84.7mm were used to convert from enterprise value to equity value. The current implied upside was calculated using the current price of $9.46.

*Wound Care Valuation*

MDXG‚Äôs FY 2021 sales guidance assumed $255 mm to $270 mm in revenue from the wound care segment. Different points in this revenue ranged were used for the low, base, and high cases of the valuation. An EV/Revenue multiple was used to calculate implied enterprise value. The comparables analysis shown in figure 2 illustrated the median multiples derived from the analysis done using the aforementioned list of MDXG‚Äôs competitors. A median multiple of 5.3x was used. The median was used and not marked down because the gross margin and UFCF yield of MDXG is in-line with all competitors. Though the EBIDTA multiple was lower, the similar yield and gross margins indicate that company performance is relatively the same. In addition, litigation expenses factored into the lower EBIDTA multiples and thus it is not indicative of recurring performance.

Based on the revenue multiples, implied share values for the wound care segment range between $12.0 and $12.8.

**Wound Care Equity Value**

**Biopharma Valuation**

Prescience Point estimated annual revenues from Amniofix through using the market capture method. The total market size (annual knee OA injections) was estimated, and a capture percentage was applied to determine the annual number of patients receiving the Amniofix injection. Prescience assumed 1.5 injections per year but to be more conservative in this valuation 1 was used. Price per injection and FDA approval probability varied by the cases and were used to adjust the EV/Rev multiple downwards. Overall, an implied share value range between $25.4 and $57.1 was calculated for this segment.

https://preview.redd.it/we0pw4jm1a071.png?width=611&format=png&auto=webp&s=567d19cc5acc59acbe552a2afcf09789c80866ff

**Biopharma Equity Value**

Overall, the total implied share price ranges between $37.43 to $69.81. As more information regarding Amniofix comes out including the price of manufacturing, different multiples can be used to fine-tune the analysis.

https://preview.redd.it/a8035yfo1a071.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=12e0f9a041e326b505bfda25304261367c651406

**Risks**

1. Given the high influence EW healthcare has on the board of directors, there is potential for more value to describe acquisitions such as that of stability biologics, which was bought for 10 million and sold for 3.5 million 3 years later. If such a trend continues, the value of MDXG‚Äôs wound care business can dramatically decrease, which will hurt the share pierce
2. The FDA approval of Amniofix is a large driver of the valuation calculated. There is a large risk that the FDA will not approve the treatment, however, with the RMAT designation in place and positive results from the first two phases of clinical trials, the odds are strongly in the favour of the approval at the current point in time.

Overall MDXG has been strongly misrepresented by management leading to a skewed opinion and pricing by the market.",nh08j4,$MDXG - Management Miscommunication Skews Valuation Down and Creates Great Buying Opportunity

Here you can see we have a **symmetrical triangle** pattern that dates back to late 2007. In technical analysis, the longer the pattern has been building, the more significant the breakout will be. Subsequently - you can imagine the magnitude a pattern like this has.

When making new all time highs I like to look for psychological resistances. As a result - logical targets for this pattern are **75.00, 100.00.** Sounds simple, but it works in practice. Keep in mind - something like this will take **3 - 5 years** to play out. This is a position trade.

In order for this breakout to stay valid - we need to continue getting monthly closes above **50.85.** You can see we've pretty much gone perfectly sideways since breaking out for **4 months** now.

This is **bullish -** moving sideways in a higher range is always biased to the upside (except in special situations with certain reversal patterns). Not only that, but we've been forming an interesting setup on the next chart I will show you all -

Chart 2: **1 Year 1 Day**

[$EEM 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/7hy7wbqeea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8102c5b1f0e92c02260cfccc6b8d77eafea8035d)

On this chart - you can make much more sense of those 4 months of sideways. We are actually working on a large **falling wedge** \- which is a bullish continuation pattern. The breakout point for this is sitting around **54.37** as I am writing this (5/20/2021).

Upon breaking this (ignoring the previous chart) - we would target **54.94, 56.49, 57.32, 60.00, 65.00.** That would be if there was no setup on the monthly chart. Each of these are resistances we could stop and consolidate at. I like to scale in after breaking each resistance. Scale into winners and cut losers fast. A break from a pattern like this would probably take **3 - 6 months** to play out.

I also want to note that **MASSIVE** increase in volume on 3/26. Generally - an uptick on volume when price is doing what you want it to is always a plus. But one like that is very intriguing - on a huge green candle too. My guess would be someone loaded their bags there (or a group of players).

And... **that's it.** Keep it simple. Those are often the best setups.

***TL;DR -***

$EEM has a big pattern - broke out 4 months ago just chopping sideways waiting for the move to happen.

Price targets **75.00, 100.00**

Stop out below **50.87** monthly close

Timeframe **3-5 years**

It also has a smaller pattern above that one - which breaks out above **54.37** and has a shorter time horizon.

Price targets **60.00, 65.00**

Stop out if we close back inside

Timeframe **3-6 months**

***Positions -***

\- Research coming out of John Hopkins University is suggesting that the use of Psilocybin is the most effective drug ever tested as a remedy for depression, anxiety, and PTSD. As the United States is currently under crisis in its battle against mental illness, these results are too impressive to ignore, even if it may need to overcome pressures from big pharma interest groups that seek to quell the expansion of this research.

\- These drugs have been extremely effective in treating addiction -- particularly alcohol and nicotine. Considering the government expenditure on the opioid crisis, once this proves to be an effective treatment, the government will expedite the medicinal legalization of the substances that MNMD has been treating/experimenting with.

\- Veterans, the most respected occupational category (statistically,) have begun launching advocacy groups for the widespread medicinal legalization of these substances due to their effectiveness against PTSD. These therapeutic measures have contributed to the plummeting of suicide rates (those treated w/ psilocybin vs. control group.) The Biden administration will have to choose ethics and reason over the suffering of veterans (former government employees) which I anticipate that they will given mounting pressure due to the effectiveness of these treatments.

If you aren't familiar with the efficient frontier, what it tries to find is the *mean-variance portfolio.* This type of model deals with portfolio management / optimization. In terms of the efficient frontier you are trying to find the best portfolio allocation weights that give you the best risk adjusted returns. 

**In simple words:** you give it stocks and it tells you the best percentage holdings

I recently built an app on some python code that does this sort of optimization. There is no programming required to use the app. When running the app it will give two portfolios, minimum variance, and maximized sharpe (same as mean-variance, mean-markowitz). Minimum variance will tell you the least riskiest holding strategy (green), and max sharpe will give you the best reward-for-risk holding (red). I call that portfolio *the-juice-is-worth-the-squeeze.* Here is a sample output.

I used around 100,000 simulations, and 10Y of adjusted close data. 

The reason why I bring this up is because it does two things. The first is that it promotes portfolio diversification, which I know is pretty uncommon here. Also it finds the most aggressive returns in terms of minimizing risk. If you have high returns and wonder why you returns are so much higher than standard investment funds its probably because you are here

How high could it go?

* Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks

* WDC Fundamentals

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community.

A little bit about myself for context:

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/555339dhob071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42585b1cfe4cf1c85eab62b0cc01791f5321f1e2

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",nh8f2j,PUBM DD #1

7404,,2021-05-20 19:09:28,t3_nh8q8x,,wallstreetbets," So this is the first time I've ever played around with options and I'm probably doing it in a dumb way but get that's more fun for you guys to watch. I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let‚Äôs go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don‚Äôt need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there‚Äôs a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

Welcome. Anybody who buys AMC and holds is able to jump on when we fly to the moon. Those dumb hedge funds are still shorting AMC. Last week on Friday, they attacked AMC trying to bring it down to $12 to win on their shorts. They failed and have to buy back those AMC shares on top of the ones they shorted in the past. They have not bought back any AMC shares and will continue to pay the interest on their shorts until they buy back all the AMC shares they shorted. The interest is slowly increasing and will eventually have to buy back the shares or pay the interest at a loss. Nobody can live off paying interest forever. Still holding onto my AMC shares.

What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either. 

Here is some better and more thought out DD:

7934,,2021-05-19 20:14:45,t3_ngftx1,,wallstreetbets,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",ngftx1,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Mr. Cramer..."

Big tech's earnings absolutely destroyed estimates but sell side thinks it's due to lock down and people will rely on tech less once things open up. It's a consistent pattern that all the gains made after earning erode overnight or in a few trading session as if the good earning did not happen.

7937,,2021-05-19 20:51:00,t3_nggpql,,wallstreetbets,"I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

7939,,2021-05-19 21:25:26,t3_nghmhm,,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",nghmhm,$NUE is strong as steel. Buy the dips.

Petco earnings is tomorrow pre-market. But this also might be a potential candidate for a short squeeze.

Short sellers are gearing up for a bad quarter. For the last three days, the short float increased from 4 point-something Monday, 6.05 yesterday, and today it's at 8.75.

In addition, short interest is up to 35.2%

To top it off, there are hardly any shares available to short, though borrowing rate remains at only 1%. For the last five days there were no more than 100k shares left to short.

The average price target is $28, but if earnings goes better than expected, this could be the catalyst for something significantly bigger. Listen to your pets' beckoning calls, and keep this on your watch list!

We‚Äôve had a run up of 55% from 5/6-5/17 to $14.38 high on 5/17.  Slight gain of 0.6% on 5/18 (similar to the slight drop on 3/19 with freaky similar volume changes) and then the massive sell off decline on 5/19 of (9.9%) is eerily similar to the (10.3%) drop on 3/22.......

Potential to give up all of the gains since 5/6 by this Friday and puts are ridiculously cheap in the $10 below range for 5/21 and 5/28.  If AMC goes on a similar slide to the March slide, there will be massive returns on these ridiculously cheap put options (9.9% decline today and the sub $10 puts barely moved in price on both the 5/21 and 5/28 expiration dates.

Cheap way to place a bet if the squeeze doesn‚Äôt materialize that could be a >10x return based on how cheap the <$10 puts are for 5/21 and 5/28 put options.

If you are holding stock, max gains you are getting for $20 is ~2x but this could be the real money maker with puts sub $10 priced at $0.01-$0.05 that could go to $0.5+ if the stock slides similar to the March slide.

7951,,2021-05-20 05:24:49,t3_ngrqqf,,wallstreetbets,"Some context: Cell carriers in the US have decided to stop the function of shared short codes (5-6 digit phone numbers) June 1. Shared short codes were the preferred means of SMS and MMS communication for B2C traffic. Short codes were free to lease in many cases, text messages were cheap, thousands of businesses could send from the same number, and throughput was incredibly high (lots of messages could be sent very fast).

The new policy enforced by the CTIA (The private club all major cell phone carriers are in) is that shared short codes are to be discontinued and replaced by dedicated short codes and A2P 10dlc (approved B2C traffic on 10-digit phone numbers). This means that every business/organization that wants to send texts must either apply for a dedicated short code or apply for a 10DLC. 

Dedicated short codes are the preferred choice for large corporations. They can handle large throughput and look good for the brand. However, they only cater to large corporations because they are thousands of dollars/year to lease. Turn around time for application is 4-6 weeks. Barrier to entry is high.

10DLC is the preferred choice for the smaller businesses since it's less expensive. But, it is still far more expensive than the shared short codes businesses are used to, requires application, and costs $50/mo in carrier and registration fees alone. Turn around time for application is less than a week. On top of fees, 10dlc isn't even fully ready. The Campaign Registry, the organization responsible for rolling out ""the new messaging standard"" for the CTIA, is still developing their API.

Enter Toll-free messaging. TF has 0 barrier to entry and can be issued to a business with SMS and MMS capabilities in seconds. It's the easiest and now the most cost-effective way to send commercial messages.

Conveniently, every major carrier announced this month (for the first time) that they will start collecting a $0.0025/message fee for every sms sent. They're ready for and expecting businesses to move to this method.

Who is Zipwhip: Zipwhip was given full reign over all TF traffic. Anyone in the US  that wants to send messages on TF codes uses Zipwhip in one way or another. They are a massive reseller that everyone is required to go through.

It was recently announced the Twilio plans on acquiring Zipwhip for $850M. Twilio is the leader is programmable messaging hands down. 

Honestly, there should be antitrust issues that arise and block the acquisition. If it goes through, Twilio owns the new world of business sms. Good chance regulators won't notice any issue. They'll miss the fact that businesses will be pressured into TF over their preferred solutions (dedicated short codes and A2P 10DLC) since it's unnecessarily complicated and expensive. TF is ready now and cheap.

TL;DR if Twilio successfully acquires Zipwhip, every small to medium sized business that wants to send texts will have to go through them. Every single one of them in the US.",ngrqqf,$TWLO stands to be the primary source for commercial text messaging

7954,,2021-05-20 08:25:07,t3_ngulnq,,wallstreetbets,"So just how big is **today's news about the initial success of the Sofusa technology**?

1st, this is a technology that aims at lymphatic delivery. 

**What does this mean?** Well, when trying to fight a disease, it's difficult to target the lymphatic system. Because of how it works and the fact that it is spread throughout our body. 

So there are MANY, MANY drugs out there that treat several conditions through the lymphatic system. But, because of what we just explained, those drugs sometimes don't work. They are not properly ""delivered"". They don't get to where they need to get to make the necessary interaction and solve the problem.

**Sorrento has developed a technology that can deliver drugs to where they actually need to go** in the lymphatic system. So this is definitely breakthrough technology. Other companies are aiming to find similar solutions. But we are definitely talking about very advanced bio-tech.

In this case, we have a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. This is a condition that worsens with time. It's very painful and limits the patient's movement. It's not very common, so we are talking about 1.5 million people in the USA and about 30 million worldwide. 

But remember, **the technology Sorrento is developing  will be able to deliver drugs treating many other diseases** related to the lymphatic system. So the market for Sofusa is very, very large.

The press release tells us Sofusa was tested on ""First Enbrel-Non-Responding"" patients. 

**What does this mean?** Patients who need the drug Enbrel and, even though they have not been taking the drug for long (it's a ""first"" for them) they are not responding to it. It isn't helping them. 

Now, Sofusa comes into play. It's job is to deliver Enbrel to the patient effectively. To ""take"" Enbrel to where it needs to go in the lymphatic system.. 

The 1st obvious advantage is that the drug wasn't helping and now helps. But there are other important advantages.

Since the drug is being carried to its targeted ""destination"" the dosage needed, diminishes. Because less is ""lost along the way"". This is important because many diseases related to the lymphatic system, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are chronic, lifelong conditions. Being able to administer less drugs really helps the patient. Now you have a drug that actually works, more potently, which reduces its dosage. All this thanks to Sorrento.

The press release points out an important factor: This is a trial on ONE type of drug/treatment. Other such trials testing the effectiveness of Sofusa are already taking place. Again, this is proof of the potentially huge market for this delivery system.

Just to get an idea, the release mentions anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. These are a type of drugs that inhibit the activity of certain proteins (they inhibit PD1 and CTLA4, which are types of proteins. By stopping their activity, they help in stopping the growth of cancer tumors). There are several drugs that fall under these categories and treat a wide variety of cancers. **Sofusa can potentially play a vital role in all these treatments**. 

This is like several companies developing apps while Sorrento is developing a new smartphone technology. Each app has its rightful use and market. But once the new smartphone is up and working, all apps will need it. So this technology has huge revenue implications. T**he fact we are hearing good news about it is HUGE**.

As for the results themselves: **The DAS28 test measures rheumatoid activity in 28 joints** in the patient's body. The joints might be swollen or tender (hurting).

This patient had a DAS28 score of 4.6, with 18 out of 28 joints compromised.  That is considered  moderate to high disease activity.  There are 4 levels of DAS 28 scores going from remission (the best) to high (the worst). So this patient was not in the worst shape going in, but pretty bad.

Using Sofusa to deliver the Enbrel drug, in just 4 weeks (this is a very short time for this type of disease!!) the results went from 4.6 to 3.0. The total amount of compromised joints, from 18 to 11. **That is a dramatic change**. The patient went from being somewhere between level 3 and 4, to being in the lower level 2, called ""low disease activity"", which indicates it's moving towards remission (the lowest level). For someone suffering from this condition, it's a real life changer. For the company selling Enbrel, it's a real market changer. And if it can equally help people with tumors, **Sofusa becomes a major therapeutic factor.** 

I hope investors understand this. **It's another major development in an already extremely promising pipeline** which is currently badly undervalued. If the price doesn't spike today by 10-15%, as it should, just from this news, it would be disappointing. 

But if you are long, today's price change isn't what matters the most. It‚Äôs the understanding that Sorrento / SRNE has ANOTHER ace in its hand!",ngulnq,How Big is SRNE news release about Sofusa success?

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC and its +23% run in the past week. A stock with a massive dividend. A stock trading with a very low P/E of and income growth of 4,200%.

So why is this stock still a buy and hold for me right now?

The CEO is positioning them to increase shareholder value, but also position the company to weather any reduction in the refi market. (65% of the business)

There are major catalysts that have been driving the increase in price that goes beyond the attention gained on WSB.

* Announced **NET earnings of $860M in the first quarter,** with huge margins.
* Reaffirmed a continued dividend, the next ex-dividend date is **6/9/2021**.
* Announced a **$300M stock buyback, representing as much as 40% of the free float** at the current prices.
* Russell index inclusion was missed last quarter due to confusion about their PREVIOUS status as a SPAC. It is expected that they will be reconsidered for Russell Index inclusions in the yearly reconstitution. While not the biggest catalyst, this is a sign of reputation and long-term stability for the stock. **The prelim list publishes 6/4/2021.**
* Creation of a jumbo mortgage product. The average loan origination in the market is \~410,000, indicating that the non-conforming section of the mortgage market is *exploding.* This is a very profitable sector of loan origination.

Other fundamentals driving a buy recommendation:

* Small float. 90M float, of which only about 60M is freely trading.
* This stock is not persistently pressured down quite as hard as others due to low share availability, but it appears based on the last two weeks it's trading the small waves of this stock to try to push it down under dangerous strike prices. A wave of positive sentiment could strangle this position in the stock. I don't have a Bloomberg terminal, but based on the evidence over the last several days, the indication is the 13.1% SI has grown.
* Exceptional open option interest for **tomorrow 5/21/2021.** The options expiring tomorrow have been documented elsewhere so I won't belabor them, but the open interest at the $9, and $10 strike represent almost 10% of the free float.
* Not a new startup, **they have been in this business since 1986**, making them almost as old as a fossil like me. They clearly survived the 2008 storm. This company isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

The cherry:

* **STILL forecasting growth in Q2**, whereas many of its competitors are not.

This post is NOT financial advice, but as someone who has ridden the waves of this stock since it was about $9, I see this position turning positive and the outlook through July for this position has high sentiment. Even if the mortgage market slows down as expected, I will hold these shares for years to come for the dividends and general stability of the organization.

My position 8000 shares @ 7.65 and 45x 6/18 8c. You can go stalk the fuck out of me if you want to see that I've been talking about this stock for some time and been saying the same thing about the strength and targets of their position since March. I am also the guy that tells you when you unintentionally reveal personal info on your yolo screenshots!

TLDR: UWMC should garner close attention for value investors looking for undervalued positions.

7965,,2021-05-20 13:28:43,t3_nh08j4,,wallstreetbets,"**Investment Thesis**

Overall, what makes MDXG a good buying opportunity right now is a combination of two factors.

* Number one is management‚Äôs miscommunication with the market. The market currently believes that wound care is the core business of MDXG, is not entirely aware of the potential of its biopharma pipeline and more specifically its Amniofix drug, and has priced the company based on this.¬†
* Number two is the huge potential of the Amniofix treatment and its ability to become the next blockbuster in the healthcare space after the conclusion of its phase 3 trial.

**Idea Summary**

MiMedx Group *(MDXG)* is a leading BioPharma and wound care business whose value has been drastically misunderstood by the market. Through drivers such as miscommunication from management about the company‚Äôs valued proposition as well as the lack of institutional investor coverage, the market currently believes that the majority of the company‚Äôs value sits in its low growth wound care business. In reality, its major competitive advantage is within its osteoarthritis drug Amniofix which has the potential to become the next blockbuster after it clears phase III clinical trials. A sum of the parts valuation was used to determine a minimum implied upside of at least 300%. Risks are discussed at the end.

**Business Overview**

MiMedx Group is a leading biopharma and advanced wound care business utilizing human placental tissues to develop products used in the healthcare sector. It processes placental tissues using its patented processes to produce allografts, which are tissues transplanted from one person to another for wound care and regeneration. These allografts are effective in healing difficult wounds because of the ability of the allograft cells to quickly associate with the cells of the patient, thereby taking part in the healing process, easing the ability of the body to close the wound, and speeding up the body‚Äôs regeneration process.

MDXG‚Äôs product offerings can be split into two business segments: wound care and biopharma (surgical solutions). Its flagship product Epifix and additional product Epicord fall under its wound care umbrella, and its flagship product Amniofix as well as additional products Amniocord, Amniofill, and Epiburn fall under its biopharma umbrella. The wound care products service the broad wound care industry, targeting specifically chronic wounds. The biopharma product line is more specific, with the flagship treatment Amniofix targeting knee osteoarthritis in specific.¬†

MDXG sells through direct sales, sales agents, and distributors in the United States. This past quarter, 95% of its sales were direct to customers such as healthcare professionals and facilities.¬†

**Internal Analysis**

The past 3 years have not been ideal for MDXG. Its revenues began to dip in 2018 around the time of their accounting scandal, the growth went from 40% in 2018, to 11% in 2019, and is currently around -16%. This sent their stock price tumbling from $16 USD to lows of almost $1 USD, though it is currently trading at $9 with new updates on their biopharma pipeline.

Their gross margin has stayed very high, around 80% while their EBITDA margins have dropped over the years. Though it wasn‚Äôt explicitly disclosed, a large part of this drop in EBITDA margins has been attributed to a temporary increase in legal fees due to the litigation MDXG has faced this past year. Its decreased volume may have also suppressed margins as the number of wound care treatments in hospitals significantly dropped during COVID-19.¬†

The company‚Äôs cash balance is sitting at a very high level of 84 mm. This is in large part due to its recent capital raise, which happened to be strongly criticized by one of MDXG‚Äôs activist investors, Prescience Point Capital (discussed in detail later).

**External Analysis**

*Wound Care Market*

The global wound care market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% from 2021 to 2028. This has been driven by the aging population and rising rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Wound care products are increasingly being used to prevent and surgical site infections.¬†

Though the overall market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% the specific advanced product segment which includes products such as those of MDXG‚Äôs which target chronic and non-healing wounds, is projected to grow much faster than 4.1%.¬†

The wound care market is relatively fragmented, with large players such as Integra LifeSciences, 3M, Johnson & Johnson, and Medtronic competing to gain the most market share. MDXG‚Äôs direct competition for its allograft advanced wound care treatments include Organogenesis, Axogen, Mediwound, and Vericel.¬†

Organogenesis is currently in the lead in this niche market, and while MDXG reported an 11% YoY decline in sales in 2020 (which has already been factored into the current price), Organogenesis reported a 30% increase. This is evident when comparing the stock performance of both companies over the past year (figure 1)

*Osteoarthritis Therapy Market*

91 million U.S. adults have arthritis, 20M have knee OA, and \~32 million per year are currently treated for plantar fasciitis, which is specifically targeted by MDXG‚Äôs Amniofix drug. There are very few FDA approved treatments for knee OA and plantar fasciitis, and those that exist have low efficacy and many drawbacks. Amniofix is currently the only treatment of its nature in phase 3 clinical trials that have posted very positive results in both company and independent trials, has been used off-label by >100K patients with zero severe adverse effects, and consistently demonstrates a significant reduction in pain as reported by patients. In addition, Amniofix has an RMAT (regenerative medicine advanced therapy) designation granted by the FDA which allows for MDXG to benefit from an expedited approval process from the FDA.

*Management Miscommunication*

The current market opinion of MDXG has been blurred by the miscommunication from company management whose goals do not align with maximizing shareholder value. This is largely due to the fact that EW healthcare, a private equity firm, has 33% representation on the board as a result of its 17% stake. From a corporate finance perspective, a private equity firm‚Äôs interests do not generally tend to align with those of public shareholders. Their influence has been exacerbated by the fact that there are no large institutional holdings in MDXG as of yet other than Prescience Point, and there has been minimal coverage on the stock leading to the market‚Äôs opinion on the company being heavily skewed by management communications.¬†

MDXG‚Äôs current growth strategy is focused on roll-ups in the wound care space. This is very characteristic of a private equity playbook, and goes alongside EW‚Äôs historical acquisitions. As was mentioned in the external analysis, the wound care space is growing at a slow rate of \~4.1%, however MDXG has lost significant market share to Organogenesis. Management has failed to realize that the current value driver of the business is within its biopharma line and not its wound care line, yet has continually communicated to shareholders that it believes it is in fact wound care and it is going to continue investing in growing within the industry.

Prescience Point Capital, an activist investor group which has advocated for change in MDXG's communication strategy, has supported the fact that MDXG‚Äôs communications have been focused on the wrong industry. At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, the potential for the drug Amniofix was drastically undersold and much time was spent convincing investors that the core business is in wound care. The 3.6% decline in shares two days after the conference illustrates how effective this strategy was.¬†

There has been strong opposition from MDXG‚Äôs board of directors to Prescience Point‚Äôs activist efforts. In a shareholder letter in early May, prior to their annual meeting, the company communicated that they believe the wound care and regenerative medicine direction being followed now is ideal. They stated that the activist investor does not understand pharmaceutical company disclosure and were advocating for speculative actions themselves though Prescience‚Äôs report discusses the opposite, with them outlining how EW‚Äôs influence on the board of directors is shifting the company‚Äôs focus away from maximizing shareholder value.

*Amniofix*

As mentioned in the external analysis, there is currently no other treatment, either in development or on the market, as effective as Amniofix in treating knee OA and also just as safe. Most recently, at its Q1 earnings call, MDXG CEO shared positive results from the phase IIb prospective trial of the treatment. There was a statistically significant reduction in VAS (visual analog score) for pain and an improvement in the foot function index score. There were also no serious adverse events during this clinical trial. Amniofix is currently in phase III trials, and MDXG believes they are on target to meet all criteria needed to find a biologics license application (BLA) so that the treatment can be introduced to the general public. MDXG is aiming to file their BLA in the first half of 2022, meaning that within a year this blockbuster treatment could be on the market, and given the feedback so far from clinical trials as well as the RMAT designation, it is highly likely.

A Prescience Point market capture analysis estimated that the treatment would bring in $4,050 million of annual sales. This is \~8 times higher than the current sales brought in through wound care. One year ago it would have been prudent to not entirely incorporate this into the share price, however today with clinical trials nearing completion and MDXG‚Äôs new RMAT designation, the likelihood of approval is much higher.

**Valuation**

From a valuation point of view, a quick sum of the parts analysis is the most ideal given the two different business lines of MDXG. A more in-depth DCF can be created once more cost information is provided from MDXG after the conclusion of clinical trials.

Shares outstanding of 109.8 mm, total debt of 51.8 mm, and total cash of 84.7mm were used to convert from enterprise value to equity value. The current implied upside was calculated using the current price of $9.46.

*Wound Care Valuation*

MDXG‚Äôs FY 2021 sales guidance assumed $255 mm to $270 mm in revenue from the wound care segment. Different points in this revenue ranged were used for the low, base, and high cases of the valuation. An EV/Revenue multiple was used to calculate implied enterprise value. The comparables analysis shown in figure 2 illustrated the median multiples derived from the analysis done using the aforementioned list of MDXG‚Äôs competitors. A median multiple of 5.3x was used. The median was used and not marked down because the gross margin and UFCF yield of MDXG is in-line with all competitors. Though the EBIDTA multiple was lower, the similar yield and gross margins indicate that company performance is relatively the same. In addition, litigation expenses factored into the lower EBIDTA multiples and thus it is not indicative of recurring performance.

Based on the revenue multiples, implied share values for the wound care segment range between $12.0 and $12.8.

**Biopharma Valuation**

Prescience Point estimated annual revenues from Amniofix through using the market capture method. The total market size (annual knee OA injections) was estimated, and a capture percentage was applied to determine the annual number of patients receiving the Amniofix injection. Prescience assumed 1.5 injections per year but to be more conservative in this valuation 1 was used. Price per injection and FDA approval probability varied by the cases and were used to adjust the EV/Rev multiple downwards. Overall, an implied share value range between $25.4 and $57.1 was calculated for this segment.

**Biopharma Equity Value**

Overall, the total implied share price ranges between $37.43 to $69.81. As more information regarding Amniofix comes out including the price of manufacturing, different multiples can be used to fine-tune the analysis.

**Risks**

1. Given the high influence EW healthcare has on the board of directors, there is potential for more value to describe acquisitions such as that of stability biologics, which was bought for 10 million and sold for 3.5 million 3 years later. If such a trend continues, the value of MDXG‚Äôs wound care business can dramatically decrease, which will hurt the share pierce
2. The FDA approval of Amniofix is a large driver of the valuation calculated. There is a large risk that the FDA will not approve the treatment, however, with the RMAT designation in place and positive results from the first two phases of clinical trials, the odds are strongly in the favour of the approval at the current point in time.

For those who don't know, $EEM - or the iShares Emerging Markets ETF - is comprised of stocks from developing nations, with a **ton** of room to grow. These countries **will** all catch up soon, it's only a matter of time. This is one of the many reasons I find this setup especially interesting.

Here are the top holdings:

[$EEM Holdings \(By Country\)](https://preview.redd.it/zh7nwb2hfa071.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cb2749a2c7d6c7f548ad89a3f9a746b56d2273)

Next, let's dig into the charts -

Chart 1: **Max Monthly (\~16 Years)**

[$EEM Max Monthly](https://preview.redd.it/ylknrqzhea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=91ee9718b89c47744e6f68224a133c48c7bcfc6f)

Here you can see we have a **symmetrical triangle** pattern that dates back to late 2007. In technical analysis, the longer the pattern has been building, the more significant the breakout will be. Subsequently - you can imagine the magnitude a pattern like this has.

When making new all time highs I like to look for psychological resistances. As a result - logical targets for this pattern are **75.00, 100.00.** Sounds simple, but it works in practice. Keep in mind - something like this will take **3 - 5 years** to play out. This is a position trade.

In order for this breakout to stay valid - we need to continue getting monthly closes above **50.85.** You can see we've pretty much gone perfectly sideways since breaking out for **4 months** now.

This is **bullish -** moving sideways in a higher range is always biased to the upside (except in special situations with certain reversal patterns). Not only that, but we've been forming an interesting setup on the next chart I will show you all -

Chart 2: **1 Year 1 Day**

[$EEM 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/7hy7wbqeea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8102c5b1f0e92c02260cfccc6b8d77eafea8035d)

On this chart - you can make much more sense of those 4 months of sideways. We are actually working on a large **falling wedge** \- which is a bullish continuation pattern. The breakout point for this is sitting around **54.37** as I am writing this (5/20/2021).

Upon breaking this (ignoring the previous chart) - we would target **54.94, 56.49, 57.32, 60.00, 65.00.** That would be if there was no setup on the monthly chart. Each of these are resistances we could stop and consolidate at. I like to scale in after breaking each resistance. Scale into winners and cut losers fast. A break from a pattern like this would probably take **3 - 6 months** to play out.

I also want to note that **MASSIVE** increase in volume on 3/26. Generally - an uptick on volume when price is doing what you want it to is always a plus. But one like that is very intriguing - on a huge green candle too. My guess would be someone loaded their bags there (or a group of players).

And... **that's it.** Keep it simple. Those are often the best setups.

***TL;DR -***

$EEM has a big pattern - broke out 4 months ago just chopping sideways waiting for the move to happen.

Price targets **75.00, 100.00**

Stop out below **50.87** monthly close

Timeframe **3-5 years**

It also has a smaller pattern above that one - which breaks out above **54.37** and has a shorter time horizon.

Price targets **60.00, 65.00**

Stop out if we close back inside

Timeframe **3-6 months**

***Positions -***

10% of my long term portfolio is in emerging markets ETFs and,

August **55c @ 0.91** \- Will always roll these back before they get below 60 DTE - Will scale in heavily after the smaller pattern breaks out

\- Research coming out of John Hopkins University is suggesting that the use of Psilocybin is the most effective drug ever tested as a remedy for depression, anxiety, and PTSD. As the United States is currently under crisis in its battle against mental illness, these results are too impressive to ignore, even if it may need to overcome pressures from big pharma interest groups that seek to quell the expansion of this research.

\- These drugs have been extremely effective in treating addiction -- particularly alcohol and nicotine. Considering the government expenditure on the opioid crisis, once this proves to be an effective treatment, the government will expedite the medicinal legalization of the substances that MNMD has been treating/experimenting with.

\- Veterans, the most respected occupational category (statistically,) have begun launching advocacy groups for the widespread medicinal legalization of these substances due to their effectiveness against PTSD. These therapeutic measures have contributed to the plummeting of suicide rates (those treated w/ psilocybin vs. control group.) The Biden administration will have to choose ethics and reason over the suffering of veterans (former government employees) which I anticipate that they will given mounting pressure due to the effectiveness of these treatments.

&#x200B;

Does this hinge on expected earnings in the long-run ... certainly!

&#x200B;

But the effectiveness of this research is undeniable and can no longer be overlooked ... because of new cultural acceptance of these alternative treatments the government's hand will be forced in legalize, or otherwise be responsible for mental illness and addiction -- all of which could be treated and cured.

If you aren't familiar with the efficient frontier, what it tries to find is the *mean-variance portfolio.* This type of model deals with portfolio management / optimization. In terms of the efficient frontier you are trying to find the best portfolio allocation weights that give you the best risk adjusted returns. 

**In simple words:** you give it stocks and it tells you the best percentage holdings

I recently built an app on some python code that does this sort of optimization. There is no programming required to use the app. When running the app it will give two portfolios, minimum variance, and maximized sharpe (same as mean-variance, mean-markowitz). Minimum variance will tell you the least riskiest holding strategy (green), and max sharpe will give you the best reward-for-risk holding (red). I call that portfolio *the-juice-is-worth-the-squeeze.* Here is a sample output.

I used around 100,000 simulations, and 10Y of adjusted close data. 

The reason why I bring this up is because it does two things. The first is that it promotes portfolio diversification, which I know is pretty uncommon here. Also it finds the most aggressive returns in terms of minimizing risk. If you have high returns and wonder why you returns are so much higher than standard investment funds its probably because you are here

How high could it go?

#Topics of discussion:

* Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks

* WDC Fundamentals

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community.

A little bit about myself for context:

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/555339dhob071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42585b1cfe4cf1c85eab62b0cc01791f5321f1e2

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",nh8f2j,PUBM DD #1

I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let‚Äôs go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don‚Äôt need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there‚Äôs a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

UWMC has had a better post-earnings period not because their top line YOY growth was so good or even indicative of something remotely possible to sustain moving forward, but really just because of the dividend and chest pounding against RKT.

I have a position in both, and before either camp starts screaming about how one is more revolutionary, or has better blah blah blah, realize that the only thing driving price action for either is public sentiment. UWMC declared a regular dividend while RKT only a special. 

Next week, either Jay Farner gets flashy (new dividend, massive auto rollout, something new) and starts publicly pushing back against Ishbia, or RKT continues downward. I think it‚Äôs 50/50 but looks ripe for anyone looking for a straddle yolo, with IV not as bad as it was before.

It might be to their advantage to do so because they are able to profit off of the availability of COMEX -- but at what price?  
In other words, saving COMEX yet again may be becoming just too *expensive* for JPM's bean counters/risk managers.  
Or maybe they simply don't have the available unencumbered silver to do this with any longer.  
JPM and their billion ounce mountain of silver may be a paper tiger. 

&#x200B;

Lets dign in !

**Comex silver warehouse .... another 1,000,000 oz is OUT OF THE VAULT, 43,000,000 oz is gone since the silverbacks arrived. This time it is all HSBC bank. And what did big powerful JP Morgan do? Nothing!! Maybe all their silver eligible is spoken for.** 

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

I spoke to a sales rep at Tesla she says they haven't delivered any Model X or S this year and she doesn't think they will.

W-shape with today's price action.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418. 
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

I am sure it will run because people are fucking crazy, but the following is to keep in mind because correction will come, without a doubt, when common sense (ie fundamentals) kicks in:

Right before the pandemic was declared, they had 685M shares outstanding; the current number is at about 1,200M. Those shares were trading at $51.9 per share at its peak; today they closed at $27.53. That provides a market cap of $35.55B at the peak before the pandemic and $33.04B currently.

At the same time, long-term debt increased from $12.94B to $31.33B. Cash on hand as at Feb 28 was $11.51B, up from $9.51B. That provides the enterprise value of $38.98 before the hit and $52.86B currently. This is a very rough calculation and some numbers may be slightly different, but it isn‚Äôt far off.

So, while they lost $11.43B last year (and made about $3B the year before), market cap hasn‚Äôt significantly changed and enterprise value rose by a whooping $14B! Pretty sure everyone in their right mind understands that this is fucking insane.

This does not take into account that they will still be burning cash for the next few months, at least; and thus, issuing more shares or assuming more debt. Income prospects are also questionable for the foreseeable future for obvious reasons. For example, RCL‚Äôs CEO was talking about ‚Äúfavourable bookings‚Äù for 2022 (!). That was on the earnings call a couple of months ago (if I recall correctly).

Then add the green regulations that will come rather sooner than later since there were talks about it in not such a distant past and the current environmental concerns of the decision makers. That will require additional capital, which leads to more dilution and/or higher debt.

What I am saying is that it isn‚Äôt even remotely as bright as people are assuming it to be. Keep in mind that what I wrote above is really just the stuff on the surface and there is more shit to scratch. When the real market correction comes, cruise liners will be taking one of the biggest hits. When that correction comes is up for debate (not in the next few months, in my opinion, but I was wrong before). You should also keep in mind that they can dilute at any time and the last time they did was at the end of February; so we may be about due for another one, maybe not. Their next earnings call is on July 9, so that dilution may come before or right after, or not at all.

Good luck on your quest and hope the tendies will find their way to your gains.",,

What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either. 

Here is some better and more thought out DD:

8531,,2021-05-19 20:14:45,t3_ngftx1,,wallstreetbets,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",ngftx1,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Mr. Cramer..."
8532,,2021-05-19 20:21:49,t3_ngg05f,,wallstreetbets,"Ever since the Feb peak, the sell pressure has been high and news pieces coming out one after another to give investors reason to sell. Sector rotation, tech bubble fear, jump in 10-year treasury rate marked the beginning of inflation fear. And mistrust in FED that JPOW will not raise interest rate until at least 2023.

Big tech's earnings absolutely destroyed estimates but sell side thinks it's due to lock down and people will rely on tech less once things open up. It's a consistent pattern that all the gains made after earning erode overnight or in a few trading session as if the good earning did not happen. 

At the same time, the indexes are still hover around all time high. Remember how excited this sub was when SPY edging $400 and we are now still at $410. Meanwhile small growth stocks have 5% - 10% up and down days regularly and overall down 30% - 50% from ATH.

8534,,2021-05-19 20:51:00,t3_nggpql,,wallstreetbets,"I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

8536,,2021-05-19 21:25:26,t3_nghmhm,,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",nghmhm,$NUE is strong as steel. Buy the dips.

Petco earnings is tomorrow pre-market. But this also might be a potential candidate for a short squeeze.

Short sellers are gearing up for a bad quarter. For the last three days, the short float increased from 4 point-something Monday, 6.05 yesterday, and today it's at 8.75.

In addition, short interest is up to 35.2%

To top it off, there are hardly any shares available to short, though borrowing rate remains at only 1%. For the last five days there were no more than 100k shares left to short.

The average price target is $28, but if earnings goes better than expected, this could be the catalyst for something significantly bigger. Listen to your pets' beckoning calls, and keep this on your watch list!

8548,,2021-05-20 05:24:49,t3_ngrqqf,,wallstreetbets,"Some context: Cell carriers in the US have decided to stop the function of shared short codes (5-6 digit phone numbers) June 1. Shared short codes were the preferred means of SMS and MMS communication for B2C traffic. Short codes were free to lease in many cases, text messages were cheap, thousands of businesses could send from the same number, and throughput was incredibly high (lots of messages could be sent very fast).

The new policy enforced by the CTIA (The private club all major cell phone carriers are in) is that shared short codes are to be discontinued and replaced by dedicated short codes and A2P 10dlc (approved B2C traffic on 10-digit phone numbers). This means that every business/organization that wants to send texts must either apply for a dedicated short code or apply for a 10DLC. 

Dedicated short codes are the preferred choice for large corporations. They can handle large throughput and look good for the brand. However, they only cater to large corporations because they are thousands of dollars/year to lease. Turn around time for application is 4-6 weeks. Barrier to entry is high.

10DLC is the preferred choice for the smaller businesses since it's less expensive. But, it is still far more expensive than the shared short codes businesses are used to, requires application, and costs $50/mo in carrier and registration fees alone. Turn around time for application is less than a week. On top of fees, 10dlc isn't even fully ready. The Campaign Registry, the organization responsible for rolling out ""the new messaging standard"" for the CTIA, is still developing their API.

Enter Toll-free messaging. TF has 0 barrier to entry and can be issued to a business with SMS and MMS capabilities in seconds. It's the easiest and now the most cost-effective way to send commercial messages.

Conveniently, every major carrier announced this month (for the first time) that they will start collecting a $0.0025/message fee for every sms sent. They're ready for and expecting businesses to move to this method.

Who is Zipwhip: Zipwhip was given full reign over all TF traffic. Anyone in the US  that wants to send messages on TF codes uses Zipwhip in one way or another. They are a massive reseller that everyone is required to go through.

It was recently announced the Twilio plans on acquiring Zipwhip for $850M. Twilio is the leader is programmable messaging hands down. 

Honestly, there should be antitrust issues that arise and block the acquisition. If it goes through, Twilio owns the new world of business sms. Good chance regulators won't notice any issue. They'll miss the fact that businesses will be pressured into TF over their preferred solutions (dedicated short codes and A2P 10DLC) since it's unnecessarily complicated and expensive. TF is ready now and cheap.

TL;DR if Twilio successfully acquires Zipwhip, every small to medium sized business that wants to send texts will have to go through them. Every single one of them in the US.",ngrqqf,$TWLO stands to be the primary source for commercial text messaging

**What does this mean?** Well, when trying to fight a disease, it's difficult to target the lymphatic system. Because of how it works and the fact that it is spread throughout our body. 

So there are MANY, MANY drugs out there that treat several conditions through the lymphatic system. But, because of what we just explained, those drugs sometimes don't work. They are not properly ""delivered"". They don't get to where they need to get to make the necessary interaction and solve the problem.

**Sorrento has developed a technology that can deliver drugs to where they actually need to go** in the lymphatic system. So this is definitely breakthrough technology. Other companies are aiming to find similar solutions. But we are definitely talking about very advanced bio-tech.

In this case, we have a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. This is a condition that worsens with time. It's very painful and limits the patient's movement. It's not very common, so we are talking about 1.5 million people in the USA and about 30 million worldwide. 

But remember, **the technology Sorrento is developing  will be able to deliver drugs treating many other diseases** related to the lymphatic system. So the market for Sofusa is very, very large.

The press release tells us Sofusa was tested on ""First Enbrel-Non-Responding"" patients. 

**What does this mean?** Patients who need the drug Enbrel and, even though they have not been taking the drug for long (it's a ""first"" for them) they are not responding to it. It isn't helping them. 

Now, Sofusa comes into play. It's job is to deliver Enbrel to the patient effectively. To ""take"" Enbrel to where it needs to go in the lymphatic system.. 

The 1st obvious advantage is that the drug wasn't helping and now helps. But there are other important advantages.

Since the drug is being carried to its targeted ""destination"" the dosage needed, diminishes. Because less is ""lost along the way"". This is important because many diseases related to the lymphatic system, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are chronic, lifelong conditions. Being able to administer less drugs really helps the patient. Now you have a drug that actually works, more potently, which reduces its dosage. All this thanks to Sorrento.

The press release points out an important factor: This is a trial on ONE type of drug/treatment. Other such trials testing the effectiveness of Sofusa are already taking place. Again, this is proof of the potentially huge market for this delivery system.

Just to get an idea, the release mentions anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. These are a type of drugs that inhibit the activity of certain proteins (they inhibit PD1 and CTLA4, which are types of proteins. By stopping their activity, they help in stopping the growth of cancer tumors). There are several drugs that fall under these categories and treat a wide variety of cancers. **Sofusa can potentially play a vital role in all these treatments**. 

This is like several companies developing apps while Sorrento is developing a new smartphone technology. Each app has its rightful use and market. But once the new smartphone is up and working, all apps will need it. So this technology has huge revenue implications. T**he fact we are hearing good news about it is HUGE**.

As for the results themselves: **The DAS28 test measures rheumatoid activity in 28 joints** in the patient's body. The joints might be swollen or tender (hurting).

This patient had a DAS28 score of 4.6, with 18 out of 28 joints compromised.  That is considered  moderate to high disease activity.  There are 4 levels of DAS 28 scores going from remission (the best) to high (the worst). So this patient was not in the worst shape going in, but pretty bad.

Using Sofusa to deliver the Enbrel drug, in just 4 weeks (this is a very short time for this type of disease!!) the results went from 4.6 to 3.0. The total amount of compromised joints, from 18 to 11. **That is a dramatic change**. The patient went from being somewhere between level 3 and 4, to being in the lower level 2, called ""low disease activity"", which indicates it's moving towards remission (the lowest level). For someone suffering from this condition, it's a real life changer. For the company selling Enbrel, it's a real market changer. And if it can equally help people with tumors, **Sofusa becomes a major therapeutic factor.** 

I hope investors understand this. **It's another major development in an already extremely promising pipeline** which is currently badly undervalued. If the price doesn't spike today by 10-15%, as it should, just from this news, it would be disappointing. 

But if you are long, today's price change isn't what matters the most. It‚Äôs the understanding that Sorrento / SRNE has ANOTHER ace in its hand!",ngulnq,How Big is SRNE news release about Sofusa success?

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC and its +23% run in the past week. A stock with a massive dividend. A stock trading with a very low P/E of and income growth of 4,200%.

So why is this stock still a buy and hold for me right now?

The CEO is positioning them to increase shareholder value, but also position the company to weather any reduction in the refi market. (65% of the business)

There are major catalysts that have been driving the increase in price that goes beyond the attention gained on WSB.

* Announced **NET earnings of $860M in the first quarter,** with huge margins.
* Reaffirmed a continued dividend, the next ex-dividend date is **6/9/2021**.
* Announced a **$300M stock buyback, representing as much as 40% of the free float** at the current prices.
* Russell index inclusion was missed last quarter due to confusion about their PREVIOUS status as a SPAC. It is expected that they will be reconsidered for Russell Index inclusions in the yearly reconstitution. While not the biggest catalyst, this is a sign of reputation and long-term stability for the stock. **The prelim list publishes 6/4/2021.**
* Creation of a jumbo mortgage product. The average loan origination in the market is \~410,000, indicating that the non-conforming section of the mortgage market is *exploding.* This is a very profitable sector of loan origination.

Other fundamentals driving a buy recommendation:

* Small float. 90M float, of which only about 60M is freely trading.
* This stock is not persistently pressured down quite as hard as others due to low share availability, but it appears based on the last two weeks it's trading the small waves of this stock to try to push it down under dangerous strike prices. A wave of positive sentiment could strangle this position in the stock. I don't have a Bloomberg terminal, but based on the evidence over the last several days, the indication is the 13.1% SI has grown.
* Exceptional open option interest for **tomorrow 5/21/2021.** The options expiring tomorrow have been documented elsewhere so I won't belabor them, but the open interest at the $9, and $10 strike represent almost 10% of the free float.
* Not a new startup, **they have been in this business since 1986**, making them almost as old as a fossil like me. They clearly survived the 2008 storm. This company isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

The cherry:

* **STILL forecasting growth in Q2**, whereas many of its competitors are not.

This post is NOT financial advice, but as someone who has ridden the waves of this stock since it was about $9, I see this position turning positive and the outlook through July for this position has high sentiment. Even if the mortgage market slows down as expected, I will hold these shares for years to come for the dividends and general stability of the organization.

My position 8000 shares @ 7.65 and 45x 6/18 8c. You can go stalk the fuck out of me if you want to see that I've been talking about this stock for some time and been saying the same thing about the strength and targets of their position since March. I am also the guy that tells you when you unintentionally reveal personal info on your yolo screenshots!

TLDR: UWMC should garner close attention for value investors looking for undervalued positions.

8562,,2021-05-20 13:28:43,t3_nh08j4,,wallstreetbets,"**Investment Thesis**

Overall, what makes MDXG a good buying opportunity right now is a combination of two factors.

* Number one is management‚Äôs miscommunication with the market. The market currently believes that wound care is the core business of MDXG, is not entirely aware of the potential of its biopharma pipeline and more specifically its Amniofix drug, and has priced the company based on this.¬†
* Number two is the huge potential of the Amniofix treatment and its ability to become the next blockbuster in the healthcare space after the conclusion of its phase 3 trial.

**Idea Summary**

MiMedx Group *(MDXG)* is a leading BioPharma and wound care business whose value has been drastically misunderstood by the market. Through drivers such as miscommunication from management about the company‚Äôs valued proposition as well as the lack of institutional investor coverage, the market currently believes that the majority of the company‚Äôs value sits in its low growth wound care business. In reality, its major competitive advantage is within its osteoarthritis drug Amniofix which has the potential to become the next blockbuster after it clears phase III clinical trials. A sum of the parts valuation was used to determine a minimum implied upside of at least 300%. Risks are discussed at the end.

**Business Overview**

MiMedx Group is a leading biopharma and advanced wound care business utilizing human placental tissues to develop products used in the healthcare sector. It processes placental tissues using its patented processes to produce allografts, which are tissues transplanted from one person to another for wound care and regeneration. These allografts are effective in healing difficult wounds because of the ability of the allograft cells to quickly associate with the cells of the patient, thereby taking part in the healing process, easing the ability of the body to close the wound, and speeding up the body‚Äôs regeneration process.

MDXG‚Äôs product offerings can be split into two business segments: wound care and biopharma (surgical solutions). Its flagship product Epifix and additional product Epicord fall under its wound care umbrella, and its flagship product Amniofix as well as additional products Amniocord, Amniofill, and Epiburn fall under its biopharma umbrella. The wound care products service the broad wound care industry, targeting specifically chronic wounds. The biopharma product line is more specific, with the flagship treatment Amniofix targeting knee osteoarthritis in specific.¬†

MDXG sells through direct sales, sales agents, and distributors in the United States. This past quarter, 95% of its sales were direct to customers such as healthcare professionals and facilities.¬†

**Internal Analysis**

The past 3 years have not been ideal for MDXG. Its revenues began to dip in 2018 around the time of their accounting scandal, the growth went from 40% in 2018, to 11% in 2019, and is currently around -16%. This sent their stock price tumbling from $16 USD to lows of almost $1 USD, though it is currently trading at $9 with new updates on their biopharma pipeline.

Their gross margin has stayed very high, around 80% while their EBITDA margins have dropped over the years. Though it wasn‚Äôt explicitly disclosed, a large part of this drop in EBITDA margins has been attributed to a temporary increase in legal fees due to the litigation MDXG has faced this past year. Its decreased volume may have also suppressed margins as the number of wound care treatments in hospitals significantly dropped during COVID-19.¬†

The company‚Äôs cash balance is sitting at a very high level of 84 mm. This is in large part due to its recent capital raise, which happened to be strongly criticized by one of MDXG‚Äôs activist investors, Prescience Point Capital (discussed in detail later).

**External Analysis**

*Wound Care Market*

The global wound care market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% from 2021 to 2028. This has been driven by the aging population and rising rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Wound care products are increasingly being used to prevent and surgical site infections.¬†

Though the overall market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% the specific advanced product segment which includes products such as those of MDXG‚Äôs which target chronic and non-healing wounds, is projected to grow much faster than 4.1%.¬†

The wound care market is relatively fragmented, with large players such as Integra LifeSciences, 3M, Johnson & Johnson, and Medtronic competing to gain the most market share. MDXG‚Äôs direct competition for its allograft advanced wound care treatments include Organogenesis, Axogen, Mediwound, and Vericel.¬†

Organogenesis is currently in the lead in this niche market, and while MDXG reported an 11% YoY decline in sales in 2020 (which has already been factored into the current price), Organogenesis reported a 30% increase. This is evident when comparing the stock performance of both companies over the past year (figure 1)

*Osteoarthritis Therapy Market*

91 million U.S. adults have arthritis, 20M have knee OA, and \~32 million per year are currently treated for plantar fasciitis, which is specifically targeted by MDXG‚Äôs Amniofix drug. There are very few FDA approved treatments for knee OA and plantar fasciitis, and those that exist have low efficacy and many drawbacks. Amniofix is currently the only treatment of its nature in phase 3 clinical trials that have posted very positive results in both company and independent trials, has been used off-label by >100K patients with zero severe adverse effects, and consistently demonstrates a significant reduction in pain as reported by patients. In addition, Amniofix has an RMAT (regenerative medicine advanced therapy) designation granted by the FDA which allows for MDXG to benefit from an expedited approval process from the FDA.

*Management Miscommunication*

The current market opinion of MDXG has been blurred by the miscommunication from company management whose goals do not align with maximizing shareholder value. This is largely due to the fact that EW healthcare, a private equity firm, has 33% representation on the board as a result of its 17% stake. From a corporate finance perspective, a private equity firm‚Äôs interests do not generally tend to align with those of public shareholders. Their influence has been exacerbated by the fact that there are no large institutional holdings in MDXG as of yet other than Prescience Point, and there has been minimal coverage on the stock leading to the market‚Äôs opinion on the company being heavily skewed by management communications.¬†

MDXG‚Äôs current growth strategy is focused on roll-ups in the wound care space. This is very characteristic of a private equity playbook, and goes alongside EW‚Äôs historical acquisitions. As was mentioned in the external analysis, the wound care space is growing at a slow rate of \~4.1%, however MDXG has lost significant market share to Organogenesis. Management has failed to realize that the current value driver of the business is within its biopharma line and not its wound care line, yet has continually communicated to shareholders that it believes it is in fact wound care and it is going to continue investing in growing within the industry.

Prescience Point Capital, an activist investor group which has advocated for change in MDXG's communication strategy, has supported the fact that MDXG‚Äôs communications have been focused on the wrong industry. At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, the potential for the drug Amniofix was drastically undersold and much time was spent convincing investors that the core business is in wound care. The 3.6% decline in shares two days after the conference illustrates how effective this strategy was.¬†

There has been strong opposition from MDXG‚Äôs board of directors to Prescience Point‚Äôs activist efforts. In a shareholder letter in early May, prior to their annual meeting, the company communicated that they believe the wound care and regenerative medicine direction being followed now is ideal. They stated that the activist investor does not understand pharmaceutical company disclosure and were advocating for speculative actions themselves though Prescience‚Äôs report discusses the opposite, with them outlining how EW‚Äôs influence on the board of directors is shifting the company‚Äôs focus away from maximizing shareholder value.

*Amniofix*

As mentioned in the external analysis, there is currently no other treatment, either in development or on the market, as effective as Amniofix in treating knee OA and also just as safe. Most recently, at its Q1 earnings call, MDXG CEO shared positive results from the phase IIb prospective trial of the treatment. There was a statistically significant reduction in VAS (visual analog score) for pain and an improvement in the foot function index score. There were also no serious adverse events during this clinical trial. Amniofix is currently in phase III trials, and MDXG believes they are on target to meet all criteria needed to find a biologics license application (BLA) so that the treatment can be introduced to the general public. MDXG is aiming to file their BLA in the first half of 2022, meaning that within a year this blockbuster treatment could be on the market, and given the feedback so far from clinical trials as well as the RMAT designation, it is highly likely.

A Prescience Point market capture analysis estimated that the treatment would bring in $4,050 million of annual sales. This is \~8 times higher than the current sales brought in through wound care. One year ago it would have been prudent to not entirely incorporate this into the share price, however today with clinical trials nearing completion and MDXG‚Äôs new RMAT designation, the likelihood of approval is much higher.

**Valuation**

From a valuation point of view, a quick sum of the parts analysis is the most ideal given the two different business lines of MDXG. A more in-depth DCF can be created once more cost information is provided from MDXG after the conclusion of clinical trials.

Shares outstanding of 109.8 mm, total debt of 51.8 mm, and total cash of 84.7mm were used to convert from enterprise value to equity value. The current implied upside was calculated using the current price of $9.46.

*Wound Care Valuation*

MDXG‚Äôs FY 2021 sales guidance assumed $255 mm to $270 mm in revenue from the wound care segment. Different points in this revenue ranged were used for the low, base, and high cases of the valuation. An EV/Revenue multiple was used to calculate implied enterprise value. The comparables analysis shown in figure 2 illustrated the median multiples derived from the analysis done using the aforementioned list of MDXG‚Äôs competitors. A median multiple of 5.3x was used. The median was used and not marked down because the gross margin and UFCF yield of MDXG is in-line with all competitors. Though the EBIDTA multiple was lower, the similar yield and gross margins indicate that company performance is relatively the same. In addition, litigation expenses factored into the lower EBIDTA multiples and thus it is not indicative of recurring performance.

Based on the revenue multiples, implied share values for the wound care segment range between $12.0 and $12.8.

**Wound Care Equity Value**

**Biopharma Valuation**

Prescience Point estimated annual revenues from Amniofix through using the market capture method. The total market size (annual knee OA injections) was estimated, and a capture percentage was applied to determine the annual number of patients receiving the Amniofix injection. Prescience assumed 1.5 injections per year but to be more conservative in this valuation 1 was used. Price per injection and FDA approval probability varied by the cases and were used to adjust the EV/Rev multiple downwards. Overall, an implied share value range between $25.4 and $57.1 was calculated for this segment.

https://preview.redd.it/we0pw4jm1a071.png?width=611&format=png&auto=webp&s=567d19cc5acc59acbe552a2afcf09789c80866ff

**Biopharma Equity Value**

Overall, the total implied share price ranges between $37.43 to $69.81. As more information regarding Amniofix comes out including the price of manufacturing, different multiples can be used to fine-tune the analysis.

https://preview.redd.it/a8035yfo1a071.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=12e0f9a041e326b505bfda25304261367c651406

**Risks**

1. Given the high influence EW healthcare has on the board of directors, there is potential for more value to describe acquisitions such as that of stability biologics, which was bought for 10 million and sold for 3.5 million 3 years later. If such a trend continues, the value of MDXG‚Äôs wound care business can dramatically decrease, which will hurt the share pierce
2. The FDA approval of Amniofix is a large driver of the valuation calculated. There is a large risk that the FDA will not approve the treatment, however, with the RMAT designation in place and positive results from the first two phases of clinical trials, the odds are strongly in the favour of the approval at the current point in time.

Overall MDXG has been strongly misrepresented by management leading to a skewed opinion and pricing by the market.",nh08j4,$MDXG - Management Miscommunication Skews Valuation Down and Creates Great Buying Opportunity

8569,,2021-05-20 15:20:43,t3_nh2zrs,,wallstreetbets,"So - this is another setup I've been watching closely for quite a long time. I've got two different charts I want to talk about today. For those who don't know, $EEM - or the iShares Emerging Markets ETF - is comprised of stocks from developing nations, with a **ton** of room to grow. These countries **will** all catch up soon, it's only a matter of time. This is one of the many reasons I find this setup especially interesting.

Here are the top holdings:

[$EEM Holdings \(By Country\)](https://preview.redd.it/zh7nwb2hfa071.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cb2749a2c7d6c7f548ad89a3f9a746b56d2273)

Next, let's dig into the charts -

Chart 1: **Max Monthly (\~16 Years)**

[$EEM Max Monthly](https://preview.redd.it/ylknrqzhea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=91ee9718b89c47744e6f68224a133c48c7bcfc6f)

Here you can see we have a **symmetrical triangle** pattern that dates back to late 2007. In technical analysis, the longer the pattern has been building, the more significant the breakout will be. Subsequently - you can imagine the magnitude a pattern like this has.

When making new all time highs I like to look for psychological resistances. As a result - logical targets for this pattern are **75.00, 100.00.** Sounds simple, but it works in practice. Keep in mind - something like this will take **3 - 5 years** to play out. This is a position trade.

In order for this breakout to stay valid - we need to continue getting monthly closes above **50.85.** You can see we've pretty much gone perfectly sideways since breaking out for **4 months** now.

This is **bullish -** moving sideways in a higher range is always biased to the upside (except in special situations with certain reversal patterns). Not only that, but we've been forming an interesting setup on the next chart I will show you all -

Chart 2: **1 Year 1 Day**

[$EEM 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/7hy7wbqeea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8102c5b1f0e92c02260cfccc6b8d77eafea8035d)

On this chart - you can make much more sense of those 4 months of sideways. We are actually working on a large **falling wedge** \- which is a bullish continuation pattern. The breakout point for this is sitting around **54.37** as I am writing this (5/20/2021).

Upon breaking this (ignoring the previous chart) - we would target **54.94, 56.49, 57.32, 60.00, 65.00.** That would be if there was no setup on the monthly chart. Each of these are resistances we could stop and consolidate at. I like to scale in after breaking each resistance. Scale into winners and cut losers fast. A break from a pattern like this would probably take **3 - 6 months** to play out.

I also want to note that **MASSIVE** increase in volume on 3/26. Generally - an uptick on volume when price is doing what you want it to is always a plus. But one like that is very intriguing - on a huge green candle too. My guess would be someone loaded their bags there (or a group of players).

And... **that's it.** Keep it simple. Those are often the best setups.

***TL;DR -***

$EEM has a big pattern - broke out 4 months ago just chopping sideways waiting for the move to happen.

Price targets **75.00, 100.00**

Stop out below **50.87** monthly close

Timeframe **3-5 years**

It also has a smaller pattern above that one - which breaks out above **54.37** and has a shorter time horizon.

Price targets **60.00, 65.00**

Stop out if we close back inside

Timeframe **3-6 months**

***Positions -***

\- Research coming out of John Hopkins University is suggesting that the use of Psilocybin is the most effective drug ever tested as a remedy for depression, anxiety, and PTSD. As the United States is currently under crisis in its battle against mental illness, these results are too impressive to ignore, even if it may need to overcome pressures from big pharma interest groups that seek to quell the expansion of this research.

\- These drugs have been extremely effective in treating addiction -- particularly alcohol and nicotine. Considering the government expenditure on the opioid crisis, once this proves to be an effective treatment, the government will expedite the medicinal legalization of the substances that MNMD has been treating/experimenting with.

\- Veterans, the most respected occupational category (statistically,) have begun launching advocacy groups for the widespread medicinal legalization of these substances due to their effectiveness against PTSD. These therapeutic measures have contributed to the plummeting of suicide rates (those treated w/ psilocybin vs. control group.) The Biden administration will have to choose ethics and reason over the suffering of veterans (former government employees) which I anticipate that they will given mounting pressure due to the effectiveness of these treatments.

Does this hinge on expected earnings in the long-run ... certainly!

But the effectiveness of this research is undeniable and can no longer be overlooked ... because of new cultural acceptance of these alternative treatments the government's hand will be forced in legalize, or otherwise be responsible for mental illness and addiction -- all of which could be treated and cured.

If you aren't familiar with the efficient frontier, what it tries to find is the *mean-variance portfolio.* This type of model deals with portfolio management / optimization. In terms of the efficient frontier you are trying to find the best portfolio allocation weights that give you the best risk adjusted returns. 

**In simple words:** you give it stocks and it tells you the best percentage holdings

I recently built an app on some python code that does this sort of optimization. There is no programming required to use the app. When running the app it will give two portfolios, minimum variance, and maximized sharpe (same as mean-variance, mean-markowitz). Minimum variance will tell you the least riskiest holding strategy (green), and max sharpe will give you the best reward-for-risk holding (red). I call that portfolio *the-juice-is-worth-the-squeeze.* Here is a sample output.

I used around 100,000 simulations, and 10Y of adjusted close data. 

The reason why I bring this up is because it does two things. The first is that it promotes portfolio diversification, which I know is pretty uncommon here. Also it finds the most aggressive returns in terms of minimizing risk. If you have high returns and wonder why you returns are so much higher than standard investment funds its probably because you are here

How high could it go? Well If we take a look at the graph below, we can see that SPCE peaked at around 60 bucks  back in February in ANTICIPATION for the previous test flight which was delayed until May for safety reasons (They had some problems with electromagnetic interference which is fixed now).

Currently the price is around 18-19 bucks, so it's an absolute steal in my opinion, but there is always the risk that some shit fucks up and the test flight is delayed even further, in which case I will have to sell the house.

#Topics of discussion:

* Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks

* WDC Fundamentals

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

I am not investing in the company as a get-rich-quick scheme, but plan to hold long term. **Saphyr** technology will continue to improve directly with design improvements, but also indirectly with the data that it continuously collects will create more accurate correlations of DNA with individual predispositions for disease. 

I believe the technology will allow for a more personal approach in the field of medicine, and should not be viewed solely as a research-based company.  

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community.

* **Earnings beat expectations in Q1 2021.**
* **Recent large insider procurement.**
* **New patents, research breakthroughs, Large Lab facility adoption.**

There are some negative indicators fundamentally, but considering Bionano is still in its infancy I am very optimistic in my outlook. The positives tip the scale in my opinion and at the very least, Bianano Genomics (BNGO) should be on your watchlist!

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

&#x200B;

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",nh8f2j,PUBM DD #1

8586,,2021-05-20 19:09:28,t3_nh8q8x,,wallstreetbets," So this is the first time I've ever played around with options and I'm probably doing it in a dumb way but get that's more fun for you guys to watch. I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let‚Äôs go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don‚Äôt need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there‚Äôs a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

# W-Shape Recovery?

[Outlook post from last night.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ngglg9/i_spy_519_recap_and_520_outlook/)

[outlook post from last night](https://preview.redd.it/3jqflwh9qc071.png?width=2468&format=png&auto=webp&s=e36443442cb090f0598fe727d8911f80fc3be7d0)

W-shape with today's price action. 

* For the w-shape to hold true we need to push over 418.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418. 
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

* RSI at 53ish (>50 = bullish)

Let's say you bought a July 16, $3600 call for AMZN today at $22.3 and sold a $3550 call for $27.88. You pocket a net of $558 (12.6% of your margin requirement of $4442). If AMZN close above $3600 at expiry you lose the whole entry cost of $4442. Risk ratio is not so great. The only way you can make some money is by closing them on a big red day other than waiting for two months to make 12.6% with a hope that SP stays below $3550 at expiry. Even than the gain is tiny. If AMZN tank by $100 tomorrow you make may be $200 by closing both position. The opposite is also true though. 

I know it's all about the risk management but I do not like the spreads for some reason. If I see too much volatility but unsure of the direction then I would buy equal number of OTM calls and puts. If SP goes up too much I will lose 50% of my initial entry for puts but the calls might go 300% giving me a net 100% profit.",,

In my opinion, they are more than a toy subscription company. Bark started selling toys, yes, but they‚Äôve been doing so while also collecting as much data as possible from their customers. At the same time, they‚Äôve always maintained a ‚Äúhigh growth startup‚Äù mentality, as they are constantly launching new projects (failing fast and failing often). Some projects are small, like mobile apps and events, others are big like Super Chewer, Eats, Bright and Home. This matters because when you put a data-centric model and a culture for innovation together, you start to realize that what they are really building is a platform. One that targets all dogs regardless of their age (from puppy to senior) and one that owns every aspect of being a pet owner (play, nutrition, health, home). So, in the same way that today more than 50% of Amazon‚Äôs operating income comes from AWS, I believe that Bark is well positioned to find an AWS-equivalent business model, that will eventually represent a big chunk of their income. This could come from their newly launched business models, like Bark Eats in the food space, or maybe from new verticals that they haven‚Äôt explored yet, like dog insurance (market with tremendous opportunity in the US). There are obviously a lot of risks associated with this vision, but if they maintain their culture for innovation, I believe that they have a good chance to get there.",,

What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either. 

Here is some better and more thought out DD:

9553,,2021-05-19 20:14:45,t3_ngftx1,,wallstreetbets,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",ngftx1,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Mr. Cramer..."

Big tech's earnings absolutely destroyed estimates but sell side thinks it's due to lock down and people will rely on tech less once things open up. It's a consistent pattern that all the gains made after earning erode overnight or in a few trading session as if the good earning did not happen.

9556,,2021-05-19 20:51:00,t3_nggpql,,wallstreetbets,"I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

9558,,2021-05-19 21:25:26,t3_nghmhm,,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",nghmhm,$NUE is strong as steel. Buy the dips.

Petco earnings is tomorrow pre-market. But this also might be a potential candidate for a short squeeze.

Short sellers are gearing up for a bad quarter. For the last three days, the short float increased from 4 point-something Monday, 6.05 yesterday, and today it's at 8.75.

In addition, short interest is up to 35.2%

To top it off, there are hardly any shares available to short, though borrowing rate remains at only 1%. For the last five days there were no more than 100k shares left to short.

2) Lordstown Week (June 21-25): Plant open house for tours, test drives, etc., and above all else, transparency.  This should alone should put the final nail in the shorts coffin.

It's still not too late to jump on the $RIDE train and ***squeeze*** the life out of the naysayers. All aboard!

We‚Äôve had a run up of 55% from 5/6-5/17 to $14.38 high on 5/17.  Slight gain of 0.6% on 5/18 (similar to the slight drop on 3/19 with freaky similar volume changes) and then the massive sell off decline on 5/19 of (9.9%) is eerily similar to the (10.3%) drop on 3/22.......

Potential to give up all of the gains since 5/6 by this Friday and puts are ridiculously cheap in the $10 below range for 5/21 and 5/28.  If AMC goes on a similar slide to the March slide, there will be massive returns on these ridiculously cheap put options (9.9% decline today and the sub $10 puts barely moved in price on both the 5/21 and 5/28 expiration dates.

Cheap way to place a bet if the squeeze doesn‚Äôt materialize that could be a >10x return based on how cheap the <$10 puts are for 5/21 and 5/28 put options.

If you are holding stock, max gains you are getting for $20 is ~2x but this could be the real money maker with puts sub $10 priced at $0.01-$0.05 that could go to $0.5+ if the stock slides similar to the March slide.

9570,,2021-05-20 05:24:49,t3_ngrqqf,,wallstreetbets,"Some context: Cell carriers in the US have decided to stop the function of shared short codes (5-6 digit phone numbers) June 1. Shared short codes were the preferred means of SMS and MMS communication for B2C traffic. Short codes were free to lease in many cases, text messages were cheap, thousands of businesses could send from the same number, and throughput was incredibly high (lots of messages could be sent very fast).

The new policy enforced by the CTIA (The private club all major cell phone carriers are in) is that shared short codes are to be discontinued and replaced by dedicated short codes and A2P 10dlc (approved B2C traffic on 10-digit phone numbers). This means that every business/organization that wants to send texts must either apply for a dedicated short code or apply for a 10DLC. 

Dedicated short codes are the preferred choice for large corporations. They can handle large throughput and look good for the brand. However, they only cater to large corporations because they are thousands of dollars/year to lease. Turn around time for application is 4-6 weeks. Barrier to entry is high.

10DLC is the preferred choice for the smaller businesses since it's less expensive. But, it is still far more expensive than the shared short codes businesses are used to, requires application, and costs $50/mo in carrier and registration fees alone. Turn around time for application is less than a week. On top of fees, 10dlc isn't even fully ready. The Campaign Registry, the organization responsible for rolling out ""the new messaging standard"" for the CTIA, is still developing their API.

Enter Toll-free messaging. TF has 0 barrier to entry and can be issued to a business with SMS and MMS capabilities in seconds. It's the easiest and now the most cost-effective way to send commercial messages.

Conveniently, every major carrier announced this month (for the first time) that they will start collecting a $0.0025/message fee for every sms sent. They're ready for and expecting businesses to move to this method.

Who is Zipwhip: Zipwhip was given full reign over all TF traffic. Anyone in the US  that wants to send messages on TF codes uses Zipwhip in one way or another. They are a massive reseller that everyone is required to go through.

It was recently announced the Twilio plans on acquiring Zipwhip for $850M. Twilio is the leader is programmable messaging hands down. 

Honestly, there should be antitrust issues that arise and block the acquisition. If it goes through, Twilio owns the new world of business sms. Good chance regulators won't notice any issue. They'll miss the fact that businesses will be pressured into TF over their preferred solutions (dedicated short codes and A2P 10DLC) since it's unnecessarily complicated and expensive. TF is ready now and cheap.

TL;DR if Twilio successfully acquires Zipwhip, every small to medium sized business that wants to send texts will have to go through them. Every single one of them in the US.",ngrqqf,$TWLO stands to be the primary source for commercial text messaging

9573,,2021-05-20 08:25:07,t3_ngulnq,,wallstreetbets,"So just how big is **today's news about the initial success of the Sofusa technology**?

1st, this is a technology that aims at lymphatic delivery. 

**What does this mean?** Well, when trying to fight a disease, it's difficult to target the lymphatic system. Because of how it works and the fact that it is spread throughout our body. 

So there are MANY, MANY drugs out there that treat several conditions through the lymphatic system. But, because of what we just explained, those drugs sometimes don't work. They are not properly ""delivered"". They don't get to where they need to get to make the necessary interaction and solve the problem.

**Sorrento has developed a technology that can deliver drugs to where they actually need to go** in the lymphatic system. So this is definitely breakthrough technology. Other companies are aiming to find similar solutions. But we are definitely talking about very advanced bio-tech.

In this case, we have a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. This is a condition that worsens with time. It's very painful and limits the patient's movement. It's not very common, so we are talking about 1.5 million people in the USA and about 30 million worldwide. 

But remember, **the technology Sorrento is developing  will be able to deliver drugs treating many other diseases** related to the lymphatic system. So the market for Sofusa is very, very large.

The press release tells us Sofusa was tested on ""First Enbrel-Non-Responding"" patients. 

**What does this mean?** Patients who need the drug Enbrel and, even though they have not been taking the drug for long (it's a ""first"" for them) they are not responding to it. It isn't helping them. 

Now, Sofusa comes into play. It's job is to deliver Enbrel to the patient effectively. To ""take"" Enbrel to where it needs to go in the lymphatic system.. 

The 1st obvious advantage is that the drug wasn't helping and now helps. But there are other important advantages.

Since the drug is being carried to its targeted ""destination"" the dosage needed, diminishes. Because less is ""lost along the way"". This is important because many diseases related to the lymphatic system, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are chronic, lifelong conditions. Being able to administer less drugs really helps the patient. Now you have a drug that actually works, more potently, which reduces its dosage. All this thanks to Sorrento.

The press release points out an important factor: This is a trial on ONE type of drug/treatment. Other such trials testing the effectiveness of Sofusa are already taking place. Again, this is proof of the potentially huge market for this delivery system.

Just to get an idea, the release mentions anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. These are a type of drugs that inhibit the activity of certain proteins (they inhibit PD1 and CTLA4, which are types of proteins. By stopping their activity, they help in stopping the growth of cancer tumors). There are several drugs that fall under these categories and treat a wide variety of cancers. **Sofusa can potentially play a vital role in all these treatments**. 

This is like several companies developing apps while Sorrento is developing a new smartphone technology. Each app has its rightful use and market. But once the new smartphone is up and working, all apps will need it. So this technology has huge revenue implications. T**he fact we are hearing good news about it is HUGE**.

As for the results themselves: **The DAS28 test measures rheumatoid activity in 28 joints** in the patient's body. The joints might be swollen or tender (hurting).

This patient had a DAS28 score of 4.6, with 18 out of 28 joints compromised.  That is considered  moderate to high disease activity.  There are 4 levels of DAS 28 scores going from remission (the best) to high (the worst). So this patient was not in the worst shape going in, but pretty bad.

Using Sofusa to deliver the Enbrel drug, in just 4 weeks (this is a very short time for this type of disease!!) the results went from 4.6 to 3.0. The total amount of compromised joints, from 18 to 11. **That is a dramatic change**. The patient went from being somewhere between level 3 and 4, to being in the lower level 2, called ""low disease activity"", which indicates it's moving towards remission (the lowest level). For someone suffering from this condition, it's a real life changer. For the company selling Enbrel, it's a real market changer. And if it can equally help people with tumors, **Sofusa becomes a major therapeutic factor.** 

I hope investors understand this. **It's another major development in an already extremely promising pipeline** which is currently badly undervalued. If the price doesn't spike today by 10-15%, as it should, just from this news, it would be disappointing. 

But if you are long, today's price change isn't what matters the most. It‚Äôs the understanding that Sorrento / SRNE has ANOTHER ace in its hand!",ngulnq,How Big is SRNE news release about Sofusa success?

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC and its +23% run in the past week. A stock with a massive dividend. A stock trading with a very low P/E of and income growth of 4,200%.

So why is this stock still a buy and hold for me right now?

The CEO is positioning them to increase shareholder value, but also position the company to weather any reduction in the refi market. (65% of the business)

There are major catalysts that have been driving the increase in price that goes beyond the attention gained on WSB.

* Announced **NET earnings of $860M in the first quarter,** with huge margins.
* Reaffirmed a continued dividend, the next ex-dividend date is **6/9/2021**.
* Announced a **$300M stock buyback, representing as much as 40% of the free float** at the current prices.
* Russell index inclusion was missed last quarter due to confusion about their PREVIOUS status as a SPAC. It is expected that they will be reconsidered for Russell Index inclusions in the yearly reconstitution. While not the biggest catalyst, this is a sign of reputation and long-term stability for the stock. **The prelim list publishes 6/4/2021.**
* Creation of a jumbo mortgage product. The average loan origination in the market is \~410,000, indicating that the non-conforming section of the mortgage market is *exploding.* This is a very profitable sector of loan origination.

Other fundamentals driving a buy recommendation:

* Small float. 90M float, of which only about 60M is freely trading.
* This stock is not persistently pressured down quite as hard as others due to low share availability, but it appears based on the last two weeks it's trading the small waves of this stock to try to push it down under dangerous strike prices. A wave of positive sentiment could strangle this position in the stock. I don't have a Bloomberg terminal, but based on the evidence over the last several days, the indication is the 13.1% SI has grown.
* Exceptional open option interest for **tomorrow 5/21/2021.** The options expiring tomorrow have been documented elsewhere so I won't belabor them, but the open interest at the $9, and $10 strike represent almost 10% of the free float.
* Not a new startup, **they have been in this business since 1986**, making them almost as old as a fossil like me. They clearly survived the 2008 storm. This company isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

The cherry:

* **STILL forecasting growth in Q2**, whereas many of its competitors are not.

This post is NOT financial advice, but as someone who has ridden the waves of this stock since it was about $9, I see this position turning positive and the outlook through July for this position has high sentiment. Even if the mortgage market slows down as expected, I will hold these shares for years to come for the dividends and general stability of the organization.

My position 8000 shares @ 7.65 and 45x 6/18 8c. You can go stalk the fuck out of me if you want to see that I've been talking about this stock for some time and been saying the same thing about the strength and targets of their position since March. I am also the guy that tells you when you unintentionally reveal personal info on your yolo screenshots!

TLDR: UWMC should garner close attention for value investors looking for undervalued positions.

9584,,2021-05-20 13:28:43,t3_nh08j4,,wallstreetbets,"**Investment Thesis**

Overall, what makes MDXG a good buying opportunity right now is a combination of two factors.

* Number one is management‚Äôs miscommunication with the market. The market currently believes that wound care is the core business of MDXG, is not entirely aware of the potential of its biopharma pipeline and more specifically its Amniofix drug, and has priced the company based on this.¬†
* Number two is the huge potential of the Amniofix treatment and its ability to become the next blockbuster in the healthcare space after the conclusion of its phase 3 trial.

**Idea Summary**

MiMedx Group *(MDXG)* is a leading BioPharma and wound care business whose value has been drastically misunderstood by the market. Through drivers such as miscommunication from management about the company‚Äôs valued proposition as well as the lack of institutional investor coverage, the market currently believes that the majority of the company‚Äôs value sits in its low growth wound care business. In reality, its major competitive advantage is within its osteoarthritis drug Amniofix which has the potential to become the next blockbuster after it clears phase III clinical trials. A sum of the parts valuation was used to determine a minimum implied upside of at least 300%. Risks are discussed at the end.

**Business Overview**

MiMedx Group is a leading biopharma and advanced wound care business utilizing human placental tissues to develop products used in the healthcare sector. It processes placental tissues using its patented processes to produce allografts, which are tissues transplanted from one person to another for wound care and regeneration. These allografts are effective in healing difficult wounds because of the ability of the allograft cells to quickly associate with the cells of the patient, thereby taking part in the healing process, easing the ability of the body to close the wound, and speeding up the body‚Äôs regeneration process.

MDXG‚Äôs product offerings can be split into two business segments: wound care and biopharma (surgical solutions). Its flagship product Epifix and additional product Epicord fall under its wound care umbrella, and its flagship product Amniofix as well as additional products Amniocord, Amniofill, and Epiburn fall under its biopharma umbrella. The wound care products service the broad wound care industry, targeting specifically chronic wounds. The biopharma product line is more specific, with the flagship treatment Amniofix targeting knee osteoarthritis in specific.¬†

MDXG sells through direct sales, sales agents, and distributors in the United States. This past quarter, 95% of its sales were direct to customers such as healthcare professionals and facilities.¬†

**Internal Analysis**

The past 3 years have not been ideal for MDXG. Its revenues began to dip in 2018 around the time of their accounting scandal, the growth went from 40% in 2018, to 11% in 2019, and is currently around -16%. This sent their stock price tumbling from $16 USD to lows of almost $1 USD, though it is currently trading at $9 with new updates on their biopharma pipeline.

Their gross margin has stayed very high, around 80% while their EBITDA margins have dropped over the years. Though it wasn‚Äôt explicitly disclosed, a large part of this drop in EBITDA margins has been attributed to a temporary increase in legal fees due to the litigation MDXG has faced this past year. Its decreased volume may have also suppressed margins as the number of wound care treatments in hospitals significantly dropped during COVID-19.¬†

The company‚Äôs cash balance is sitting at a very high level of 84 mm. This is in large part due to its recent capital raise, which happened to be strongly criticized by one of MDXG‚Äôs activist investors, Prescience Point Capital (discussed in detail later).

**External Analysis**

*Wound Care Market*

The global wound care market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% from 2021 to 2028. This has been driven by the aging population and rising rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Wound care products are increasingly being used to prevent and surgical site infections.¬†

Though the overall market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% the specific advanced product segment which includes products such as those of MDXG‚Äôs which target chronic and non-healing wounds, is projected to grow much faster than 4.1%.¬†

The wound care market is relatively fragmented, with large players such as Integra LifeSciences, 3M, Johnson & Johnson, and Medtronic competing to gain the most market share. MDXG‚Äôs direct competition for its allograft advanced wound care treatments include Organogenesis, Axogen, Mediwound, and Vericel.¬†

Organogenesis is currently in the lead in this niche market, and while MDXG reported an 11% YoY decline in sales in 2020 (which has already been factored into the current price), Organogenesis reported a 30% increase. This is evident when comparing the stock performance of both companies over the past year (figure 1)

*Osteoarthritis Therapy Market*

91 million U.S. adults have arthritis, 20M have knee OA, and \~32 million per year are currently treated for plantar fasciitis, which is specifically targeted by MDXG‚Äôs Amniofix drug. There are very few FDA approved treatments for knee OA and plantar fasciitis, and those that exist have low efficacy and many drawbacks. Amniofix is currently the only treatment of its nature in phase 3 clinical trials that have posted very positive results in both company and independent trials, has been used off-label by >100K patients with zero severe adverse effects, and consistently demonstrates a significant reduction in pain as reported by patients. In addition, Amniofix has an RMAT (regenerative medicine advanced therapy) designation granted by the FDA which allows for MDXG to benefit from an expedited approval process from the FDA.

*Management Miscommunication*

The current market opinion of MDXG has been blurred by the miscommunication from company management whose goals do not align with maximizing shareholder value. This is largely due to the fact that EW healthcare, a private equity firm, has 33% representation on the board as a result of its 17% stake. From a corporate finance perspective, a private equity firm‚Äôs interests do not generally tend to align with those of public shareholders. Their influence has been exacerbated by the fact that there are no large institutional holdings in MDXG as of yet other than Prescience Point, and there has been minimal coverage on the stock leading to the market‚Äôs opinion on the company being heavily skewed by management communications.¬†

MDXG‚Äôs current growth strategy is focused on roll-ups in the wound care space. This is very characteristic of a private equity playbook, and goes alongside EW‚Äôs historical acquisitions. As was mentioned in the external analysis, the wound care space is growing at a slow rate of \~4.1%, however MDXG has lost significant market share to Organogenesis. Management has failed to realize that the current value driver of the business is within its biopharma line and not its wound care line, yet has continually communicated to shareholders that it believes it is in fact wound care and it is going to continue investing in growing within the industry.

Prescience Point Capital, an activist investor group which has advocated for change in MDXG's communication strategy, has supported the fact that MDXG‚Äôs communications have been focused on the wrong industry. At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, the potential for the drug Amniofix was drastically undersold and much time was spent convincing investors that the core business is in wound care. The 3.6% decline in shares two days after the conference illustrates how effective this strategy was.¬†

There has been strong opposition from MDXG‚Äôs board of directors to Prescience Point‚Äôs activist efforts. In a shareholder letter in early May, prior to their annual meeting, the company communicated that they believe the wound care and regenerative medicine direction being followed now is ideal. They stated that the activist investor does not understand pharmaceutical company disclosure and were advocating for speculative actions themselves though Prescience‚Äôs report discusses the opposite, with them outlining how EW‚Äôs influence on the board of directors is shifting the company‚Äôs focus away from maximizing shareholder value.

*Amniofix*

As mentioned in the external analysis, there is currently no other treatment, either in development or on the market, as effective as Amniofix in treating knee OA and also just as safe. Most recently, at its Q1 earnings call, MDXG CEO shared positive results from the phase IIb prospective trial of the treatment. There was a statistically significant reduction in VAS (visual analog score) for pain and an improvement in the foot function index score. There were also no serious adverse events during this clinical trial. Amniofix is currently in phase III trials, and MDXG believes they are on target to meet all criteria needed to find a biologics license application (BLA) so that the treatment can be introduced to the general public. MDXG is aiming to file their BLA in the first half of 2022, meaning that within a year this blockbuster treatment could be on the market, and given the feedback so far from clinical trials as well as the RMAT designation, it is highly likely.

A Prescience Point market capture analysis estimated that the treatment would bring in $4,050 million of annual sales. This is \~8 times higher than the current sales brought in through wound care. One year ago it would have been prudent to not entirely incorporate this into the share price, however today with clinical trials nearing completion and MDXG‚Äôs new RMAT designation, the likelihood of approval is much higher.

**Valuation**

From a valuation point of view, a quick sum of the parts analysis is the most ideal given the two different business lines of MDXG. A more in-depth DCF can be created once more cost information is provided from MDXG after the conclusion of clinical trials.

Shares outstanding of 109.8 mm, total debt of 51.8 mm, and total cash of 84.7mm were used to convert from enterprise value to equity value. The current implied upside was calculated using the current price of $9.46.

*Wound Care Valuation*

MDXG‚Äôs FY 2021 sales guidance assumed $255 mm to $270 mm in revenue from the wound care segment. Different points in this revenue ranged were used for the low, base, and high cases of the valuation. An EV/Revenue multiple was used to calculate implied enterprise value. The comparables analysis shown in figure 2 illustrated the median multiples derived from the analysis done using the aforementioned list of MDXG‚Äôs competitors. A median multiple of 5.3x was used. The median was used and not marked down because the gross margin and UFCF yield of MDXG is in-line with all competitors. Though the EBIDTA multiple was lower, the similar yield and gross margins indicate that company performance is relatively the same. In addition, litigation expenses factored into the lower EBIDTA multiples and thus it is not indicative of recurring performance.

Based on the revenue multiples, implied share values for the wound care segment range between $12.0 and $12.8.

**Wound Care Equity Value**

**Biopharma Valuation**

Prescience Point estimated annual revenues from Amniofix through using the market capture method. The total market size (annual knee OA injections) was estimated, and a capture percentage was applied to determine the annual number of patients receiving the Amniofix injection. Prescience assumed 1.5 injections per year but to be more conservative in this valuation 1 was used. Price per injection and FDA approval probability varied by the cases and were used to adjust the EV/Rev multiple downwards. Overall, an implied share value range between $25.4 and $57.1 was calculated for this segment.

https://preview.redd.it/we0pw4jm1a071.png?width=611&format=png&auto=webp&s=567d19cc5acc59acbe552a2afcf09789c80866ff

**Biopharma Equity Value**

Overall, the total implied share price ranges between $37.43 to $69.81. As more information regarding Amniofix comes out including the price of manufacturing, different multiples can be used to fine-tune the analysis.

https://preview.redd.it/a8035yfo1a071.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=12e0f9a041e326b505bfda25304261367c651406

**Risks**

1. Given the high influence EW healthcare has on the board of directors, there is potential for more value to describe acquisitions such as that of stability biologics, which was bought for 10 million and sold for 3.5 million 3 years later. If such a trend continues, the value of MDXG‚Äôs wound care business can dramatically decrease, which will hurt the share pierce
2. The FDA approval of Amniofix is a large driver of the valuation calculated. There is a large risk that the FDA will not approve the treatment, however, with the RMAT designation in place and positive results from the first two phases of clinical trials, the odds are strongly in the favour of the approval at the current point in time.

For those who don't know, $EEM - or the iShares Emerging Markets ETF - is comprised of stocks from developing nations, with a **ton** of room to grow. These countries **will** all catch up soon, it's only a matter of time. This is one of the many reasons I find this setup especially interesting.

Here are the top holdings:

[$EEM Holdings \(By Country\)](https://preview.redd.it/zh7nwb2hfa071.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cb2749a2c7d6c7f548ad89a3f9a746b56d2273)

Next, let's dig into the charts -

Chart 1: **Max Monthly (\~16 Years)**

[$EEM Max Monthly](https://preview.redd.it/ylknrqzhea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=91ee9718b89c47744e6f68224a133c48c7bcfc6f)

Here you can see we have a **symmetrical triangle** pattern that dates back to late 2007. In technical analysis, the longer the pattern has been building, the more significant the breakout will be. Subsequently - you can imagine the magnitude a pattern like this has.

When making new all time highs I like to look for psychological resistances. As a result - logical targets for this pattern are **75.00, 100.00.** Sounds simple, but it works in practice. Keep in mind - something like this will take **3 - 5 years** to play out. This is a position trade.

In order for this breakout to stay valid - we need to continue getting monthly closes above **50.85.** You can see we've pretty much gone perfectly sideways since breaking out for **4 months** now.

This is **bullish -** moving sideways in a higher range is always biased to the upside (except in special situations with certain reversal patterns). Not only that, but we've been forming an interesting setup on the next chart I will show you all -

Chart 2: **1 Year 1 Day**

[$EEM 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/7hy7wbqeea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8102c5b1f0e92c02260cfccc6b8d77eafea8035d)

On this chart - you can make much more sense of those 4 months of sideways. We are actually working on a large **falling wedge** \- which is a bullish continuation pattern. The breakout point for this is sitting around **54.37** as I am writing this (5/20/2021).

Upon breaking this (ignoring the previous chart) - we would target **54.94, 56.49, 57.32, 60.00, 65.00.** That would be if there was no setup on the monthly chart. Each of these are resistances we could stop and consolidate at. I like to scale in after breaking each resistance. Scale into winners and cut losers fast. A break from a pattern like this would probably take **3 - 6 months** to play out.

I also want to note that **MASSIVE** increase in volume on 3/26. Generally - an uptick on volume when price is doing what you want it to is always a plus. But one like that is very intriguing - on a huge green candle too. My guess would be someone loaded their bags there (or a group of players).

And... **that's it.** Keep it simple. Those are often the best setups.

***TL;DR -***

$EEM has a big pattern - broke out 4 months ago just chopping sideways waiting for the move to happen.

Price targets **75.00, 100.00**

Stop out below **50.87** monthly close

Timeframe **3-5 years**

It also has a smaller pattern above that one - which breaks out above **54.37** and has a shorter time horizon.

Price targets **60.00, 65.00**

Stop out if we close back inside

Timeframe **3-6 months**

***Positions -***

10% of my long term portfolio is in emerging markets ETFs and,

August **55c @ 0.91** \- Will always roll these back before they get below 60 DTE - Will scale in heavily after the smaller pattern breaks out

\- Research coming out of John Hopkins University is suggesting that the use of Psilocybin is the most effective drug ever tested as a remedy for depression, anxiety, and PTSD. As the United States is currently under crisis in its battle against mental illness, these results are too impressive to ignore, even if it may need to overcome pressures from big pharma interest groups that seek to quell the expansion of this research.

\- These drugs have been extremely effective in treating addiction -- particularly alcohol and nicotine. Considering the government expenditure on the opioid crisis, once this proves to be an effective treatment, the government will expedite the medicinal legalization of the substances that MNMD has been treating/experimenting with.

\- Veterans, the most respected occupational category (statistically,) have begun launching advocacy groups for the widespread medicinal legalization of these substances due to their effectiveness against PTSD. These therapeutic measures have contributed to the plummeting of suicide rates (those treated w/ psilocybin vs. control group.) The Biden administration will have to choose ethics and reason over the suffering of veterans (former government employees) which I anticipate that they will given mounting pressure due to the effectiveness of these treatments.

&#x200B;

Does this hinge on expected earnings in the long-run ... certainly!

&#x200B;

But the effectiveness of this research is undeniable and can no longer be overlooked ... because of new cultural acceptance of these alternative treatments the government's hand will be forced in legalize, or otherwise be responsible for mental illness and addiction -- all of which could be treated and cured.

If you aren't familiar with the efficient frontier, what it tries to find is the *mean-variance portfolio.* This type of model deals with portfolio management / optimization. In terms of the efficient frontier you are trying to find the best portfolio allocation weights that give you the best risk adjusted returns. 

**In simple words:** you give it stocks and it tells you the best percentage holdings

I recently built an app on some python code that does this sort of optimization. There is no programming required to use the app. When running the app it will give two portfolios, minimum variance, and maximized sharpe (same as mean-variance, mean-markowitz). Minimum variance will tell you the least riskiest holding strategy (green), and max sharpe will give you the best reward-for-risk holding (red). I call that portfolio *the-juice-is-worth-the-squeeze.* Here is a sample output.

I used around 100,000 simulations, and 10Y of adjusted close data. 

The reason why I bring this up is because it does two things. The first is that it promotes portfolio diversification, which I know is pretty uncommon here. Also it finds the most aggressive returns in terms of minimizing risk. If you have high returns and wonder why you returns are so much higher than standard investment funds its probably because you are here

How high could it go?

#Topics of discussion:

* Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks

* WDC Fundamentals

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community.

A little bit about myself for context:

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/555339dhob071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42585b1cfe4cf1c85eab62b0cc01791f5321f1e2

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",nh8f2j,PUBM DD #1

I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let‚Äôs go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don‚Äôt need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there‚Äôs a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

There is little difference in their lines of business at the moment, margins are similar, products are similar. There‚Äôs very little differentiation, he‚Äôll they‚Äôre in the same city. UWMC has had a better post-earnings period not because their top line YOY growth was so good or even indicative of something remotely possible to sustain moving forward, but really just because of the dividend and chest pounding against RKT.

I have a position in both, and before either camp starts screaming about how one is more revolutionary, or has better blah blah blah, realize that the only thing driving price action for either is public sentiment. UWMC declared a regular dividend while RKT only a special. 

Next week, either Jay Farner gets flashy (new dividend, massive auto rollout, something new) and starts publicly pushing back against Ishbia, or RKT continues downward. I think it‚Äôs 50/50 but looks ripe for anyone looking for a straddle yolo, with IV not as bad as it was before.

It might be to their advantage to do so because they are able to profit off of the availability of COMEX -- but at what price?  
In other words, saving COMEX yet again may be becoming just too *expensive* for JPM's bean counters/risk managers.  
Or maybe they simply don't have the available unencumbered silver to do this with any longer.  
JPM and their billion ounce mountain of silver may be a paper tiger. 

&#x200B;

Lets dign in !

**Comex silver warehouse .... another 1,000,000 oz is OUT OF THE VAULT, 43,000,000 oz is gone since the silverbacks arrived. This time it is all HSBC bank. And what did big powerful JP Morgan do? Nothing!! Maybe all their silver eligible is spoken for.** 

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

The long story can be read in the links below.

I spoke to a sales rep at Tesla she says they haven't delivered any Model X or S this year and she doesn't think they will. TSLA is really effected by the chip shortage, orders from Dec. were promised Mar. & now they aren't expected till Oct and may be pushed back over all to 2022.

W-shape with today's price action. 

* For the w-shape to hold true we need to push over 418.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418. 
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

Then in 2020 and they had 255.3M in revenue, or a -24% growth rate. Yet the stock is WAY WAY WAY higher than before pandemic and before Pandemic their growth rate was practically 0%. Now it is negative. Even if Build a Bear would regain its entire 2019 revenue the fair value of the stock is before $5. Don't listen to the news outlets pushing reopening socks so they can dump these massive bags on you. The market has Build a Bear style stocks everywhere right now. Look at SEAS it is the same story and its fair value is under $20 based on pre-pandemic revenue.

Here is the link and you can see with your own eyes.

The report is full of extremely biased and unfounded views, claiming that Yalla's numbers are ""Too good to be true"".

However, anyone with access to the internet can easily find out that Yalla's two major applications: Yalla and Yalla Ludo, consistently rank as top 5 and top 10 highest revenue grossing apps in 20 different countries.

You can see Yalla's revenue numbers are consistently higher than HUGE corporations like Tinder, Clash of Clans. In UAE, one of the richest and largest market in the middle east, Yalla has two apps in the top ten on AppStore and it is beating Youtube in terms of revenue. You gotta remember, Yalla is only valued at $2 Billion, a small fraction of the companies they are beating on the revenue chart. (Netflix has a market cap of $222B currently.

Yalla is currently trading at **16 times trailing P/E,** when YoY growth exceeds 221% in Q1. Again, shorts conveniently bypassed easily accessible AppStore revenue ranking and claiming that the numbers are ""Impossible"". In conclusion, if Yalla is valued at 60 times trailing P/E for its 221% growth rate, the company would be easily valued at at least $60 per share. 

These smaller shorts will be PUNISHED for messing with a growth beast like YALLA. Guys, you know what to do next!",nhg4u0,YALLA (NYSE: YALA) Number One Grossing App Across The Middle East Under Short Attack!
