I know this is disappointing, and you probably put some hard work into this, but this is how we keep the WSB feeds clean for everyone, including the /new feed.

In the last week AMC has doubled in value - but the share float has turned over 3X to get there. 

So hypothetically - at this rate to get to $100 - the float will churn over 5-10X, and we need to continue getting new buyers.

Check out YouTube for how options work because you'll lose money if you do not understand them deeply. I myself lost hundreds of not thousand but not understanding the Greeks. Too much detail to go into here. Key is understanding premiums paid can be lost due to intrinsic value ( underlying stock value) and extrentrsic value ( time and price action/volitility )

I will say to develop god tier diamond hands  study entry points and buy stocks because after intial investment it cost you nothing to hold. When or if you feel there is a significant chance of a run you add options to your position to multiply your gains. Options are and always will be your most risky investment they can expire worthless. If you do decide to dip your toe in the water give yourself plenty of time for your bet to play out. Don't get a contract on Thursday that expire on Friday out of the money you could be flushing your cash down the drain.

Finally it is always good to have cash on hand to exercise an option if you choose being if the option chain has been up and it hard to sell that contract because it has undesirable Greeks and a short time to get it off your hands you can exercise it ( losing a little of cash cuz you lose the premium) and immediately putting those share on the market. It is rare that you'd rather exercise rather than sell the contract or roll it but you want to remain flexible.

Anyway hope this helped a little and good luck!!"

Puts meaning if stock falls, you make money. Strike prices are just premiums, the closer the strike price, the more you make but also the more you spend per contract. Exp dates are just when the contracts expire. The further out you go the more expensive since its considered ‚Äúless risk‚Äù but the near exp dates are usually more volatile. Id recommend getting strike prices that are nearby the current value and exp date to be 3 months out to be safe but if its a daytrade to do it for that week WITH a stop loss."

You don't actually own the cryptocurrency that you pay for, it's basically Robinhood given you a coupon that they say is worth X amount of crypto but only redeemable at one specific location.

You'll end up having to pay fees, but Coinbase Pro is an easy service to sign up for. It uses the same account as regular Coinbase, but when on the free pro platform fees are drastically reduced. Certain cryptocurrencies aren't available through them, but the most popular ones tend to be.

In my opinion the minimal fees (literally a fraction of a percent) are worth the ability to actually own the thing I'm paying for."

I know this is disappointing, and you probably put some hard work into this, but this is how we keep the WSB feeds clean for everyone, including the /new feed.

The only thing that would change my tune is if GME came up with an actual strategy.  They failed miserably at online marketplace before,, simply because gamers don't want another online marketplace.  They don't want to maintain another account for another library when they already get their shit on their existing platforms.  That avenue is bust.  Steam is already a huge competitor.  They will need to get really inventive.   I don't think the desires of gamers have changed much.  Also, publishers are now going exclusive to their marketplaces.  The whole online gaming market is a mess with 500lb gorillas everywhere.  

I'm not buying a company trading at 10x revenue basis that has experienced a straight 5 years of decline.  Asset decline.  Revenue decline.  Earnings decline.  5 years.  

Enjoy your pre-earnings pump.  Earnings better be fantastic.  I have a feeling that it'll be more of the same as the last 5 years."

The trader app only makes a minimal interest in borrowing to your retarded crayon-filled ass and a transaction fee/brokerage (don't trade without these, you know why). 

When you then inevitably buy high and liquidate low, all of that money went to the market, save for the debt to the broker. 

The broker is literally the loser here, since you at least were worth some more fees when you had money to trade with."

Here on this Youtube link you will see the company co-founder of Zash, Ted, as one of the guest speaker of this event talking about NFT's and how company is operating towards this $6B market. **$BBIG Vinco Ventures has reached the #52 with the highest Borrow Rate 94.44%**. **Float is 27.4M and 20% of it has being shorted.** Lomotif is #1 Rival of TikTok with way superior features and business model to disrupt the whole media and marketing market. Zash & Vinco (BBIG) MERGER day is tomorrow May 28. **Last time the merger was announced BBIG jumped from $1.50 to $9.40** and finally this ambitious project has come to the completion date. **BBIG & Zash (father of Lomotif) merge can easily have a valuation of $1B market cap** which appoints new price per share to be **$20-$40** after merge is complete!! Shorties have played it really bad for bulls and we all have to come together to punish them for all they have done. Let's all come together and spread the word to make an epic and historical story of **SHORT SQUEEZE!!!**![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)"

The option price consists of two parts - intrinsic and extrinsic value. Intrinsic is defined by how far ITM the option is, and extrinsic is purely the prospective value of the option. By exercising the option you will only ever capture the intrinsic value, but selling the option to another buyer will allow you to sell it at the intrinsic + extrinsic value.

Take any option, and then subtract the strike price from the current price and multiply that by 100. Thats intrinsic value, compare that to the current market price of the option. The option's premium will always be higher."

I‚Äôd even dare to say an extremely small share offering at an abysmally high number(like 500k per share -1k share) would be beneficial for the company long term and would cause a sudden jump as shorts decide to cover as they realize there will never be a large enough dilution for them to cover. I still think the amc ceo is a pos who is trying to bring his buddies on the board so they can get a payout as well. If his buddy isn‚Äôt elected to the board I bet the stock jumps in 2022. If his buddy is elected to the board I‚Äôm willing to bet it drops from dilutions and corporate payouts.

If EDIT 101 trial data is positive and the patients have recovered partial(90% - 100% chance) or full vision(50% to 80%), EDIT should be trading between $80 - $100 again this year.

In the past few years, most of the major partners(Juno, Celgene, Allergan and Blue Rock etc.) that EDIT had collaborations with had all been acquired by larger companies. EDIT will become the next target sooner or later for about $10B($150) to $20B($300) as the Nobel prize CRISPR technology become more mature and starting bearing fruits.

Next stock offering would most likely be above last offering price $66 with great news released which I don't think it's too far away from us given the media starting telling the inspiring stories of the patients and the doctors and the on-going EDIT 101 trial. This offering would bring EDIT cash level up to $1B.

If I were 11M EDIT short position, I would have started covering now at such low price which won't last long...ARK will start buying back EDIT soon as well...

Good luck to all, no matter you are short or long right now... 
The fact that you are here trading(or even bashing) EDIT, you have showed your interest. 
EDIT is a great swing trading stock as well despite its great long-term investment value so don't miss this rare opportunity again. 

Mr. Market is very emotional to push up EDIT to $99.95 a few months ago and then dump it to $30s level again, now it's the time to buy EDIT back again Mr. Market. 

Nothing really changed between $99.95 and $30s other than now EDIT has much better management team, much more cash and much closer to the good news to be released..."

Like take AMC right now. MASSIVE price spike. If you think that'll pull back you could buy OTM puts and sell them back after they gain value even if they're never near the strike assuming they beat out the decay.   


Big advantage to OP rolling up is that he was able to have multiple exits and could have taken money out as long as the stock went up any appreciable rate. If you'd known AMC was going to spike to 25+ when it was at 10 you could have bought some $20 options and made a killing without incrementally buying/selling and rolling up."

Fundamentals: about a month ago Borrow utilization was above 90% with heavy borrow fees and steadily increasing price. Short interest was around 20 to 25% as well. 

Also it was a reopening play, the better the vaccines the more people are going to movies. That weekend mortal Kombat came out and the ticket sales crushed it kicked off the stock rise as the shorts were getting heavier. 

Timing is really hard to get. If you look at my history I was playing the last 3 weeks. Two weeks ago I went up a hundred thousand, them to last week got crushed and lost 90,000, volume picked up again Monday so I thought there was a hell of a good chance happening this week..
