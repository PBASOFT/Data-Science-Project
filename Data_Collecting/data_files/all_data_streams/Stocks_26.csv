The problem is it's a form of leverage and with that carries risk, and people combine multiple forms of risk to screw themselves over. It's like a power tool. Treat it with respect it makes your life nicer, and if you don't things will go badly quickly. 

A little margin on a support level on a blue chip, with plans to rebalance/deleverage if things don't go as planned? Can be very lucrative and still relatively safe.

50,gzg9juu,2021-05-25 23:32:52,t1_gzg9juu,t1_gzftub0,stocks,"My dad gave me a warning when I first started investing that haunts me to this day and its where this particular bit of advice comes from. See we grew up in a very affluent area where we were middle class but most around us were considered pretty wealthy. My dad worked for a uber rich family company and the higher ups he interacted with used to always toss around big boy talk of how much they had in their portfolios or real estate, etc and on paper they were millionaires. Many would even talk down to my dad about how he wasn't rich because he wasn't investing properly (mind you these guys made 10x what my dad and were born into it so they had zero idea what it took to actually earn your money). He did invest he just always bet a cow instead of the farm which all these supposed millionaires thought was just the dumbest. 

Then, 2008 rolled around. These guys were bankrupt almost overnight. Suddenly their millionaire status was reduced to nothing. Much of what they owned had been bought on their net worth and when the crash happened, that net worth went to zero. As the company began struggling you can imagine the toddler tantrums that occurred because suddenly these guys couldn't pay mortgages and were essentially broke. Several of the non family personnel were laid off and had to sell property at a huge loss just to keep above water because their properties were worthless. Even some of the middle class guys that thought investing was the way to go got screwed because their savings were so much lower than investments. My dad managed to be ok and he bit his tongue when the same people who treated him like an idiot for not pouring his savings into the stock market came crying over how unfair it was that they now had nothing as if it was some injustice.

If you can lose 65k and still be ok, power to ya. Too many people think investments are sure things and while they aren't exactly a craps table, it's not a good mentality to live by. Personally, I make sure we have enough in the bank to cover six months of no job and lost investments.

`shares to buy = Stock price at last peak / current stock price * current quantity - current quantity`

In this case, you might say use 25% of your money to buy regularly and keep the other 75% to buy dips.

You can also use this leveraged approach (the simple solution is 1X leverage):

`shares to buy = (Stock price at last peak / current stock price * leverage - current quantity * leverage)`

Basically in this case, with a 2X leverage, if it goes down 1%, you'll buy 2% more shares. If it goes back up to where it was, you'll get about `% decrease^2 * leverage` profit from the movement backup and `% decrease * leverage` additional profit as the price continues to move up.",,

Why do keep people claiming this? It's complete BS.

Tell me how AMC is going to zero (heavily invested in AMC, got nothing in GME, so can't argue the fundementals of the company too much).

They paid off massive debt, they got enough money to for the next 2 years, unless a new Covid breaks out, and theaters are seeing more and more traffic.

&#x200B;

Look I can argue naked shorting, I can tell you that the numbers point to at least double the float being on loan, but I'm sure I can't convince you of that.  
Stock can go down for a while etc. But claiming that if we don't win, the shares will be worthless... please.

I won't argue whether AMC would normally be a good stock to hold long term, short term for sure (though maybe not at the current price if you don't believe in the squeeze), but AMC can only do better then the past year, so it will see a lot of positivity, which drives up the price.  
Longterm, meh I don't know, they could do really well, they could go back in the red and collapse, who knows. But thinking this can just go worthless, please...  


  
Btw this is why I went AMC over GME. When I got wind of this, GME had it's first squeeze already, I read about this going much bigger, and I 100% believe in that now, but back then I didn't. All I knew was that the stock was extremely overvalued, it was driven by the shorts, not the actual value of the company itself. Now some will believe they will do well in the future, others don't. Either way, the highest it had been was 54 bucks, so at 200+ this felt just like a way too risky deal.  


AMC had a serious run up, but fell back to pretty much it's pretty before that run up, a price point was among the lowest in history, while it had positivity going on (debts being paid) and theaters opening once covid got more and more under control. It was a safe bet, if it's not the squeeze, it will go up from opening up again.

Atm I've almost double my money, I'm not even thinking about selling yet. June 2nd will see a recount of the shares, all the numbers we have right now, points to way more shares being in the market than are reported. At that point things will go insane, and the impact on the market will be massive.

&#x200B;

But hey even if you don't believe in any of those numbers, remember that still like 30% of the stock is on loan according to the likes of Fintel, Ortex etc etc, and that will cause a squeeze no matter what, because the more the price goes up, the more they have to pay, and sooner or later it's gonna pop.   


In the end, profit is profit, so no matter how high this goes, I will do absolutely fine.",,

Ford might not have amazing products but every manufacturer has had serious recalls to be concerned about. Tesla has been a champ at damage control but their products have faced serious accusations lately. Look at the latest EU fines getting thrown at them over battery manipulation. I think that's just the tip of the iceberg for tesla. On a sidebar, I think part of why Musk has been so desperate to be in the headlines lately is because there are design flaws in the cars, and the company has serious debt and management issues that are all starting to come out of the woodwork.

Ultimately the reason I like Ford is that the stock is not where it should be based on their financials and I like the signs of their new leadership. Which means if it can move, it'll move well.

2) Your money consists of two types...settled and unsettled
3) Unsettled money is money that you have used to buy and then sell something...that money is considered unsettled until it works it way through a verification system for accuracy. The system usually settles those funds by the next day (but it may take longer)
4) Settled funds are new money and money that is not unsettled. 
5) Most accounts have some type of Margin which leverages personal money to obtain larger amounts of money (borrowed money). $25K day trade limit makes sure that margin accounts can cover loses.

They will blow for time whenever inflation becomes too detrimental to the uber-richs savings ; inflation is a wealth transfer from lenders to borrowers over time. We are already seeing equities and bonds become more correlated in their moves, because the market is expecting the period of free money to come to an end. When time is up, everything is coming down. 

If you're asking, ""When is the music going to end?"" Then my bet is the Fed is going to raise rates in Q1 2021, but I also think they are behind the market and the 10 year is going to 200 basis points by November. So the market will probably sell off some time between now and then.

From a technical perspective, we are trading in and around the fibonnaci extension from the previous cycle high pre-covid (SPY $339.70) at 1.618 of $414.90, which was pretty much on the nose with the close from the day before yesterday at $414.94. The 1.618x target would be $535.60, which is definitely out of reach given we are already deep in the euphoria stage of the market cycle. 

So I would guess action is going to trade side-ways-ish depending on the news over the next few weeks, then begin trending back towards SPY $340 towards Q1. If Burry is right and the Fed is behind the curve on hyper-inflation, then we're probably going bear market $160-180. But if inflation does not get too out of hand and the Fed reverses course after raising rates and starts pumping again, it could be $535. So that would be my 3 year call hehe $160-$535, depending on whether the music *stops* or just slows down.",,

Pick one: VTI vs SPY vs QQQ (Just because Growth and Tech has such big market caps now, they over lap with SPY)  
Pick one: VPYD vs NOBL   
SDIV - Keep

* World Ex-US index

When this deal was announced May 17th DISCA and T were on fire. Premarket I was watching shares catch fire and go above $43 on DISCA. Later on during the day, I did decide to start trading it as it fell to $34. In my opinion close to $34-35 is a fair value for the stock without a deal!

DISCA now has 15 + million subscribers for their 4.99 service. Expectations were for 8. We all know the streaming is the wave. As we see also with Netflix and Disney there is enough for them all provided we have rich content. In the most recent report DISCA beat on top line and said that the streaming business added 4 million subs in just the last 2 months. This business is alot more profitable. Current bottom line is about 2.79 for the year, next year is about 3.25 without factoring in the rapid streaming and more profitable side of the business. This yields a PE ratio of this year near 11 and next year under 10! Doesn't that sound cheap for a large company that will grow sales between 10-15%?

This is all before the Warner Media deal.... So in my mind DISCA is worth 34-35.... On it's own its executing and turning the business around.....so now with Adult Swim, Boomerang, Cartoon Network, CNN, TBS, TNT, TruTV, Turner Classic Movies, Turner Sports, HBO..... now its worth less?

I understand we won't be able to see the full details and synergies yet.... this deal may or may not even close! It will be at least 6 months out.... but in the mean time DISCA which has been delivering is getting crushed? This combines to be close to a 50 billion company...... Unfortunately, T paid over 85 billion, and there is still alot of debt. But please help me figure out how DISCA isnt worth at least 35..... 

Should we just can the deal and fight to stop the merger? Is that what the market is saying? That combining all that and maybe charging 14.99 for HBO and Discovery + and maybe having 100 million subscribers is not good?...... Do we see what it is doing for DISNEY? Just shaking my head here.

Instead, most ecom business owners I know have switched completely to 3rd party marketplaces. The marketplace collects the sales tax for you. States have no incentive to pursue you for not filing $0 sales tax returns. Without sales tax accounts you can avoid income tax concerns too.

When economies go south it happens quick and often before most people can prevent major losses.

If you have $5k in the bank and $40k in stocks and a repeat of the pandemic happened next month (you lose your job and the market crashes 80%) how long could you wait for the market to pick back up without having to pull that money out? My personal opinion is to have six months of savings that could keep you afloat jobless and with a market crash. It's easy to think another pandemic or recession wouldn't happen so soon but it's always possible, and there are other market disruptors such as war, natural disasters and political upheaval that you should keep in mind.

* Mutual Fund: There are a lot more of these with different themes, styles, objectives. They are actively managed, so they carry higher management fees. Buying through an advisor also carry 12-B1, load fees, and other BS. THEY ARE TAXED ANNUALLY
   * Index Mutual Funds: the subgroup with single objective: Find a benchmark and replicate it. Fees are a lot lower and more accessible. still TAXED ANNUALLY
* ETFs: There are very few ""active"" ETFs, majority of them are index ETFs. Just like Mutual Funds with their objectives, but they are TAXED ONLY AT THE POINT OF SELL.

Personally I do favor ETFs because of the tax advantages. There are some styles that are only available in Indexed Mutual Funds, so I'll take those. For your time horizon of 20-25 years before before you start withdrawing from this portfolio. You can still apply a long time horizon type of allocations. These are the metrics I go by with allocations:

1. Asset Class: stay with the standard: Bond vs Stock - 10/90 or 15/85 is good
2. Region: US vs Euro vs Asia - within equity I tried to maintain a 40% US vs 60% Euro/Asia
   1. Developed vs Emerging: Minor, but Emerging has a higher expected return however higher risk
3. Market Cap: This is harder to manage with Funds/ETFs, so they can only be tilted so much. 
4. Value vs Growth: This is very minor now.....optional

I personally rely on morningstar because they have a vast database on the fund's mix and metrics. [https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/arcx/spy/portfolio](https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/arcx/spy/portfolio)

* Avoid ETFs with weird names and weird Tickers like YOLO or ROBO etfs that starts with ""ARK"". I won't get into the boring details about the darkside of ETF
* If you having trouble with figuring out how to allocate, then focus on #1 and #2.  Keep your selections to only a handful of funds. simplicity is key
* Simplicity allows you to more easily re-balance your portfolio EVERY YEAR

Also you CANNOT just set it and forget it. [https://www.morningstar.com/articles/962396/heres-why-you-should-rebalance](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/962396/heres-why-you-should-rebalance)

I'd wait right in the next week or two for clarity as we get a move one way or another away from SPY $415. If the market still has room to move higher, then I'd maintain 25% USD, 15% EUR (managing the currency balance depending on whether EURUSD breaks higher or lower), 5% crypto (once volatility has died down; BTC, ETH, IOTA); 10% gold, and 55% in reopening equity trades. Financials, consumer spending, and cash-positive FANGs like Apple and Google. Just try to keep your positions as simple as possible so you can quickly liquidate your positions and move into a strong currency if shit hits the fan.

I think if you wait you'll be able to get 225 basis points or more on the 10 year, some time next year. It will depend on whether inflation gets out of control or not, whether the Fed needs to go on a crazy hiking spree that would crush bonds. But I'd probably start buying the front end of the curve out to the 10 year bonds around 190-225 basis points in small position sizes, maybe through ETFs. I wouldn't use ETFs outside of bonds however, as you can usually find good picks that will outperform the market, and you don't want to be caught in a stampede where you are trying to sell the same basket of stocks as every other retail investor out there. 

So yeah, 40-45% cash position, then try to sell-out before the music stops, and look to buy the big companies with an aggressive 75% equity/15% bond/ 5% crypto/ 5% cash portfolio. For the equities portion, I'm thinking:

Alphabet 15%

Amazon 12.5%

Tesla 12.5% (Tesla, unlike Google, Apple, and Amazon, is debt heavy with relatively weak cash flow, so will suffer from high rates more than other tech companies. So buy low.) 

Nvidia 10%

Apple 10%

JP Morgan 10%

Microsoft 5%

Visa 5%

Costco 5%

Home Depot 5%

Coca-cola 5%

Crispr 2.5%

It is more obvious now than it ever was prior that this company is about to explode.

Demand is high. They sell every car they can produce. They are expanding their production capacity and will have two new factories coming online later this year.

They are improving margins with new technology/manufacturing processes and economies of scale.

They are improving revenue by producing and selling more cars every quarter.

Significantly increased revenue with higher margins equals explosive growth for the stock once the PE ratio adjust.

622,,2021-05-26 02:17:08,t3_nl614g,,stocks,"Hello everyone. As we all know China is extremely populated and they definitely lover their bikes. They are much more affordable than cars. They are much less space. They are cheaper than gas and most importantly pretty much anyone, any age can use a bike! I tried to research as much as I could the exact number of bikes in China but I could not find that unfortunately. The 600 million estimate was as close I could find.

Most importantly we may be able to make an investment. EZGO is the Ebike and IPO’ed early on in January. The execution from the company has been amazing. However, the stock has come down a lot. The figures yesterday 5/24/2021 given by the CEO were 6 months thru March 31st of 2021 and did not even include some big deals. 

Let me go thru some important highlights and insights from the CEO:

**Revenue grew 224% to $16.8 Million from just $5.2 Million**

**Projected sales of 100,000 bikes in 2021 (Which was given February 17th)**

**Sales of the 2 wheel bicycles increased 50% to 23,000 units while the 3 wheel increased 600% to 11,000 units! Total of 34,000 units. (5/24/2021 The CEO gave this update and said sales have increased drastically and it expects rapid revenue growth)** 

***These numbers were for ending March 31st and does not Include the following!!!***

**4/1/2021 EZGO reports a large order from the Ukraine the stock spikes to 9.48!** **These bikes are to be delivered in April!**

**4/15/2021 EZGO signs a new contract for 10,000 Bikes after an exhibition displaying their bikes**

Their higher end bike sells for about $300 US dollars and travels 225 miles on a single charge. Most bikes are about $200 and have 150-200 Mile range. You can go to their website EZGOtech, I do not want to get banned by including links. The bikes look great!

At 100,000 bikes, could be more and 300 a bike we are looking at 30 million in sales………which is 100% growth again……. I believe that estimate is light!

The T-35, and T-21 FTD cycles started as a hopeful theory, but after today, April, March, Feb, Jan, and Dec, it’s hard to deny that this theory is at least strongly correlated to a surge in GME price.

You're looking at dividends the wrong way. It's not they don't payout a lot, it's that their payout is so highly valued that the asset price increases to make the dividend yield appear small. 

I've held aapl for awhile. The dividend yield is tiny, smaller than when I first bought it. However, they've increased their dividend damn near year single year. I may think the div yield is inconsequential, but you have to remember, my cash on cash dividend return is on my cost basis for the shares, not what it's trading at as unrealized gains. For people who've owner these companies for a while, (large shareholders who actually appoint the board of directors) their dividends would be massive.

Here's an example. Buffet bought a stake in KO for $1.3B. Since the purchase they've make over $7B in dividends and they will receive dividends over $650M just this year alone.

Not sure if you have heard of Google and Microsoft but they are in fact large companies which make your “Amazon has too much power wahhhh” argument nonsensical. 

AWS is king because of a first mover advantage. Users have plenty of alternatives and in fact GCP is cheaper now for most users. So if your job is pointing out the dangers of one company owning a third of (western, not global) Internet, and you are citing this as an example

The landscape is vastly different than the fifties. G/S ratio climbed because of tech. Which is now the reason people are now fine holding intangible assets as if they had a gold bar; (banned word rhyming with brypto) and tokens most notably.

G/S ratio very closely follows inflation in a positive correlation. An inverting G/S ratio to inflation goes against 20+ years of data.

Supply is a huge deal also. Other “experts” laughed when interviewed about Reddit running the price up like GME/AMC. They can just ramp up supply. Only 25% of silver is specifically mined. The other 75% are byproducts from other mining operations. If silver starts spiking, mining is ramped up. Over the past 20 years every single spike in silver has quickly corrected. To me, that’s because of the supply issue. At $100, a lot of miners are dropping other products and going hard on silver.

But even at $130, does it really matter if you paid $32 an ounce when spot was $28.

Absolutely it does.

That’s the equivalent of being charged a $4 fee per share of a $130 stock purchase. That is absurd. That also doesn’t include the sell which would be another $19.50 fee. Can’t say I’d be happy paying $23.50 fee per share at any price.

I don’t see why this is any better than a low fee ETF based on physical assets. The risk is no higher than the risk of someone breaking into your house and running off with the safe in your closet, imo.

For the retail investor I still feel holding physical metals is novelty, and priced as such.

For the G/S ratio, why is it even relevant? And why do experts only focus on the denominator? For example in 1980, when G/S ratio was 1:17 silver was $50/oz. Even then, that was because of price manipulation of silver and low gold prices. It isn’t exactly fair to apply historical ratios to current times while also only adjusting the price of silver.

All said, the fact that retail investors are pouring into the market, they can’t afford gold, and they like the idea of holding a physical investment, that bodes well for silver. Though I just can’t see a $100 price target in less than 10 years.

Lastly, I’m not saying you’re wrong by any means and that I’m right. These are just my observations which could completely be false. If you have strong convictions against any of my points, I’d love to hear your perspective.",,

I note that silver historically fluctuates between 1:20 and 1:45. Recently it's 1:65ish. You can adjust gold to whatever price you want, but for over 2000 years, silver was worth roughly 1:15 - 1:30 of that price. Unless we want to argue that gold is massively overpriced, a 1:67 ratio (as of today) would tend to point to silver being undervalued. Will it ever ""correct?"" Perhaps not, but it seems like a better place to put my money.

I'll quickly acknowledge that the last 20 years have significantly deviated from past norms. It's my hypothesis that this is unsustainable over the next 40, and that the global banks have printed their way into a tipping point where we may see a shift back towards physically backed assets. It's the same with the digital, where we can clearly see a waning faith in paper currency. Perhaps the latter will be the better performing asset, but I can wrap my head around physical money more easily than a digital, backless one. I'm likely wrong. 

I'm not in PMs to try to make great returns, though. I think it's a fine long term store of value, that will counter inflation. Holding physical vs an ETF is a matter of personal preference, and the latter is fine. I personally prefer physical precisely because it's outside of the market. I'm the last person to get into conspiracies about PM ETF holdings, but having the overwhelming majority of my net worth tied to the market, it's nice to have a store of value exist outside of that. The chances of the US going all Venezuela and imploding are extremely unlikely, but if you're bothering to hedge your investments in the first place, it makes more sense to me to just do it ""right"" and hold physical. It's similar to how RH doesn't allow their investors to own the keys to the digital they supposedly own. 

I'm not disagreeing with any of your points, but I'm not sure where you get that $19 fee to sell. I can walk down to my LCS today and get spot value. I lose, at current prices roughly $4 on the premium paid, but like I said, they're abnormally high right now. Over a lifetime of buying, they tend to be lower. I understand when I purchase today, that I'm essentially buying at $32/oz. It's my belief that over the next few decades, it will be worth more than that. I'll reiterate that I'm not shooting for any market beating returns, it's a safeguard against any problems. 

Ultimately, my case boils down to holding physical because I believe it to be a more adequate hedge against a highly unlikely collapse than holding those assets inside the market, and that silver is currently undervalued to the price of gold. Both of those things could very well prove to be untrue, and maybe I end up losing out in the long term. But at only 3% of my portfolio, I'm OK taking the risk of a loss for the downside protection against any crazy devaluation of the dollar.

But a PM hedge isn't for everyone, so don't listen to me.",,

Not the person you were talking to, but I'll chime in as someone who has learned more about how all this stuff works in the last 3 months than I've known in the last 30 years.

I firmly believe that if half of what is being proposed for GameStop comes through then it could be closer to $1k per share in less than 5 years, not counting however high it gets with the MOASS (more on that later). 

GameStop sits in a really unique place as one of the leaders of the retail gaming industry. Anyone under about age 45 that grew up as a gamer knows who GameStop is and what they do as a retailer. The reason they got shorted in the first place was that the hedge funds saw a brick and mortar store that wouldn't survive being shutdown for Covid and they wanted to short it into oblivion and walk away with some fat cash like they've done many times before. This probably would have worked, until Ryan Cohen joined the fight.

When Ryan Cohen and his team jumped on board, they brought a lot of clout and experience in e-commerce. They are working hard to transition GameStop into an e-commerce powerhouse. The worldwide video game market is estimated around 200 billion USD. GameStop is going toe-to-toe with the likes of Amazon when people are choosing to buy video games. If they can carve out a larger share of that market, they'll already have a huge business.

Another interesting thing is distribution. Amazon offers 2 day delivery, right? Well, since Cohen and his team have taken over, GameStop has begun offering SAME DAY delivery for some things if they're in stock. They literally have stores all around the world, which they are using like distribution centers. People have reported ordering something off of GameStop's website and having a Door dash driver deliver it to their house literally a few hours later if it was in stock at their local store. Add to that Ryan Cohen's attention to customer service, as in literally handling an issue himself with an unhappy customer in [March](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-gamestop-cohen-insight/from-pet-food-to-video-games-inside-ryan-cohens-gamestop-obsession-idUSKBN2BF1AS)  and you've got a recipe for an amazing customer-focused experience.

Now, let's talk peripherals. Ever bought a high end gaming mouse or keyboard? They aren't cheap. Ever been able to test it out before you bought it in case you don't like it? Not likely. GameStop is also renovating their stores to be almost [gaming centers] (https://www.cbr.com/gamestop-adding-net-cafes/amp/). This could be a place to hang out with friends or test new equipment. They've also added literally hundreds of new PC components to their website over the last few months and are making deals to get into E-sports.

I could literally keep going for several more paragraphs about all the things they are doing. It's incredible the transition they are making. I haven't even mentioned the new news about NFT and blockchain that came out today.

The fundamentals are there. 

As far the MOASS, I have no idea where it will be. Average mean theory says that even at $20 million a share, the total payout would average out to be about $4 trillion paid out. That's a lot of money, but not enough to ruin the entire financial system. Will it make it that high? Who knows? Am I going to ride the rocket and see what the hell happens? You bet.",,
877,,2021-05-26 04:01:26,t3_nl7uwe,,stocks,"I personally think all these companies: Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, and Amazon are all really good companies. But, IF YOU HAD TO INVEST IN ONLY ONE OF THEM. Which one would you invest in and why? 

They’re all huge, still growing, and making a lot of money. I am invested in all of them. Wasn’t a fan of Facebook, still not, yet I can’t deny that from an investing perspective they are a strong company. While I thought Facebook was dying and just for moms and dads, they got Instagram which everyone my age loves and used. They monetized their offerings tremendously well. Every time I thought they’re on a down hill from social pressures, they shoot back up. 

Microsoft was my favorite holding. I love Nadella, I love his vision. He played a tremendous role into turning Microsoft around and into the company that it is today. Their cloud services are growing and I believe are second behind AWS. They have their productivity and business sector which is compromised of office. Office changed was pushed towards a subscription model, one with better profit-margins.  As and end user I’m not a fan of this, but to get through college I needed those subscriptions. Their personal computing segment has been growing with their surface line. While I personally have a surface pro, I don’t love it. Yet since I got it they have been updating their line and have been putting pressure on the competition. I’m also excited for their gaming division. Not only their Xbox but how they are offering a new gaming experience. While I believe it almost may be redundant to get an Xbox if you have a gaming pc, how they’re connecting players on Xbox and pc may be the better option long term (potentially). 

Apple has been making amazing iPhones. While they have not been revolutionary model to model, people love their ecosystem. That’s the biggest thing for me. People love iPhones. They love MacBooks. Show me a college white girl without a MacBook, good luck. They go better together than a college white girl and starbucks. Also they are expanding offerings in their ecosystem. Their offerings are very easy to use, simple yet not plain, and a premium product. This is a company that has been consistently delivering amazing products. 

Alphabet, I’m not really sure what they do. Googles search engine I’m not sure anyone will ever overtake them. They are consistently adapting and improving it. They a make ton of ad revenue not only from google but YouTube. The more we use their products, the more data they collect, the better they know us and can profit of us. They I love YouTube ads? No. Are they making a ton of money of us? Yes. Also, they have a big R&D budget. That puts me at peace about their future, that they are eager to grow and not satisfied with that they have achieve. 

Amazon I believe of all companies has been spending the most on R&D. Their AWS Is leading and growing. From my understanding Azure still has a lot of catching up to do in terms of product quality and offerings. In fact, I would love Amazon even without their online market place. I really love Amazon For their AWS. I believe it brings in most of their profit. 

I don’t believe any of these companies are perfect, some of their products I don’t like, some of their fundamentals I’m not a fan of; yet, overall I think each of these companies has a lot of strengths. I own all of them, yet, if you had to choose one of them to invest in, you can choose the time horizon, which one would you invest in? And why?",nl7uwe,"Between FMAGA, which company would you invest in?"

Eight months ago, I made my first ""call of calls"" on a blockbuster event amongst reverse mergers.  Eight months ago, I made the ""call of calls"" on what was then a different ticker, and what now belongs to Lordstown Motors (RIDE).

And indeed, RIDE went on to become the fourth of nine realized blockbuster events amongst reverse mergers.

Then came Workhorse's loss of the USPS contract.  That was nothing, as production could continue on the main EV product.  Lordstown Motors could still take on Ford and its F-150.

Then came the Hindenburg short report.  RIDE became the second of three realized blockbuster events shorted by Hindenburg.  Like, really?

Then came the announced production delays recently, most likely due to semiconductor shortages.  The commercial EV startup's chances against Ford got dashed big time.

Then came something bigger and more unfortunate for RIDE bagholders: Rivian is just another EV startup.  Ford is a typical Big Auto laggard in EVs.

Not so the Next Tesla.

Not so the Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto, its proven track record in the commercial pickup truck business, and [now its own foray into EV pickup trucks](https://motorillustrated.com/volkswagen-trademarks-amarok-is-compact-pickup-coming/76784/), semiconductor shortages be damned.

958,,2021-05-26 05:08:34,t3_nl8xqa,,stocks,"I started looking at Lithia Motors ($LAD) in the past couple of weeks.  They're an automotive retailer here in the states with a Market Cap of $10.37b.  Their growth is in main accomplished through M&A of other dealerships.  

* Downsides include: 
   * susceptibility to economic downturns, 
   * if interest rates climb it will make it harder for them to offer attractive financing,
   * 2020 supply chain shortages interrupting inventory,
   * High debt levels,
   * Competitive advantages, as I see them currently, are limited:
      * small pricing advantage over smaller competitors,
      * limited protection in certain markets where regulations or distributor arrangements keep their competitors out for certain vehicle brands.
* Fundamental Numbers:
   * Free Cash Flow - went positive for the last 4 years. They ended 2020 with $381m in FCF. 
      * CAGR on FCF from 2017 to 2020 equaled 86.4%.
   * From 2010 to 2020
      * Revenue grew from $2b to $13.1b (CAGR 20.5%).
      * BVPS CAGR was 24.7% (2020 BVPS of $111.83).
      * EPS CAGR was 43.7% (2020 EPS of $19.53).
      * ROE in 2020 was 25.6% (CAGR 19.2%)
   * Total Debt in 2020 was $4.175b
   * Long-term debt was $2.311b 
   * LT Debt to Earnings = 4.92

The last few numbers are very concerning to me.  That's a whole lot of debt they are carrying!  Combined with limited economic moats.... Hmmmm.  However, I did compare their 2020 numbers to Carmax, one of their biggest competitors.  Carmax had a whooping LT Debt/Earnings ratio of 20.7, revenue of roughly $19b, and EPS of $4.52.  Carmax's growth number were also much less overall.

Given their LT debt/Earnings was roughly 1/4 of a direct competitor's and their growth numbers were looking good to me, I was continuing to do some reading and research.  Then Lithia made a rather big announcement.  They're doing a new public offering of shares valued at $1b.  At the same time they announced a private offering of $800 million in senior notes (3.875%) that would be due 2029...  Nearly another billion in LT Debt?!?!?  ARRGGHHHHH!

Looking at their 2021 Q1 presentation, they do give target uses of capital, which at least shows they have a plan that they are willing to publish.  Those plans are as follows:    

* Internal Investment & Modernization 25% 
   * (Actual 5-year average: 17%) 
* Share Repurchases 5%
   * (Actual 5-year average: 11%) 
* Dividends 5% 
   * (Actual 5-year average: 4%) 
* Acquisitions 65% 
   * (Actual 5-year average: 68%) 

Their stated goal in the 2021 Q1 for acquisitions is an annual addition of $3-5 billion in revenues.  They also posted good numbers for Q1 YoY and compared to the previous quarter.  However, with the debt now I feel like the research rabbit hole has gotten a little deeper for me....

I suppose the silver lining is that the 2 valuations of the company I ran and margin of safety puts them outside of my current buy range.  So I've got the time for the research.",nl8xqa,"Lithia Motors ($LAD), just killin' me in the middle of DD"

I'm viewing 50% growth as the minimum target this year and with Q1 showing 74% YoY growth and production ramping alongside an expansion in Shanghai plus two additional factories starting up later in the year I don't think that's terribly unreasonable.
