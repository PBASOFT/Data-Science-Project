If every step in the supply chain is managed ethically (extraction, transport and eventual use), it can be significantly cleaner than the plant would have otherwise been.

Yup, it's still fossil fuels so it's not green but the grid can't reliably run 24/7/365'ish on renewables alone at this point. Large scale battery deployments would be a game changer in smoothing out renewables' ability to become primary sources for our grid (in the US at least) by filling in demand gaps when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing.

Yeah, it‚Äôs going to be a lot of work for sure. But every great business transformation is.

I personally believe the new leadership can do it. They‚Äôve already done an incredible job just in the last five months by paying down all debt, raising $500m (which is now $800m in cash on hand), setting up same-day delivery, setting up their esports department, and improving their customer service by moving the call support to the US from overseas. 

They have a long way to go, but they aren‚Äôt even close to the same company that they were 6 months ago and I think that‚Äôs worth investing in.

Annovis Bio Inc. (ANVS) shares more than doubled to $55.37 after the company said it saw positive results from a placebo- controlled study of ANVS401, its lead drug candidate for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.

The company said patients treated with ANVS401 for 25 days showed statistically significant cognitive improvement as measured by the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 11.

From baseline to 25 days in the ANVS401-treated group, ADAS-Cog11 improved by 4.4 points, a statistically significant improvement of 30%. Additionally, the ANVS401-treated group compared with placebo group at 25 days showed an improvement of 3.3 points, or 22%.

If he sells a call he can offset the premium of the put, I get that. 
So if the price decreases, his put gain in value and his call is worthless so he would've effectively make profit. 

But if the price increases, his put would be worthless and he'd have to either deliver the underlying stock at a cheaper price (bc of the contract) or buy a call contract at a higher price (bc the spot price now increased) to close his position. So he would lose money. 

So selling calls would only be benificial to offset the put premium if the price decreases. Did I get the logic right?",,

A - It's still massively overvalued, regardless of what market you put it in
B - It's a car company.

> most Auto Companies haven‚Äôt sunk a fraction of the costs that Tesla have into clean energy or even electric vehicle technology

Ehhhh, not quite. Renault and Nissan have invested comparable amounts into their own EV divisions. Since most companies are working on an open standard for charging, they don't need to sell their own chargers or infra, they can rely on the industry standard. Tesla has to sell their own because they're going with the Apple route of having a special snowflake charger. That's cool and all but **they do not make any profits from their energy products or utilities, those are losses they eat to sell cars**.

> Tesla heavily out performs its competitors when it comes to money invested in driverless technology

I've addressed this in another comment. Tesla are not the only people who provide level 2 advanced driver assistance.

Let's pretend that everything you've said is correct. Would that still mean that Tesla sells all cars sold in the world for the next 10 years? Because that's what their current valuation would require.

Keep drinking the kool-aid all you like pal, ignore the competition all you like. I've bought my TSLA puts and I'm very happy with my results to date.

**Bottom line is this, and you retards don't seem to understand this: I am not saying Tesla is a shit company, I'm ASSUMING that it grows into the top 3 auto makers in the next 10-15 years. Even if they become the most successful car company in the world, and sell more cars than Ford, BMW, Nissan, and Toyota combined... the current share price for Tesla is too high.**

You retards don't seem to be smart enough to understand the nuance of what I'm saying so I'll give up on this thread. The stonk market is *slightly* more complicated than ""hurrr rdurrrrrrrr company good so stonk go up more"". It is entirely possible that a company is guaranteed to grow, but still be overvalued.

Fucking retards, whatever, keep buying, the P/E ratio is only 800 now, what a bargain...",,

OK, let's pretend that's true. That still makes Tesla overvalued as shit. If we assume they sell 90% of the cars sold in the world... their share price is still too high. This is not a question of ""Tesla good"" or ""Tesla bad"", or me claiming they're not going to grow like they claim they will, the car market is simply not big enough to justify their share price as it is today.

> I don‚Äôt know any other car manufacturers that are actually developing that technology

Then you should shut the fuck up and start doing some research before spouting useless, uninformed opinions. Literally every car company is working on *advanced driver assistance* (that's what they call it, since ""self-driving"" is a fucking pipe-dream that only retards fall for).

> Tesla is the only one out there right now,

Uhhh no, again, every big car company is working on advanced driver assistance, some Volvos can park themselves, and overtake on motorways, just like Teslas.

> Autonomous cars will take over from drivers and once again Tesla is the winning horse in that field

A - Fully autonomous driving is a pipe-dream. I say that as a software engineer with a masters in AI. Tesla themselves are backpedaling on self-driving claims.

B - Tesla have only reached level-2, just like Volvo and Nissan.

https://www.telecomtv.com/content/automotive/canalys-8-of-new-cars-in-europe-sold-with-level-2-autonomy-driving-features-36247/

Have you done literally zero research on this? I'm not even going into the latest research here, this is fucking basic shit...

> EVs will take over from petrol

Sure, I'm assuming they will, that still does not indicate a complete Tesla dominated monopoly.",,

2603,,2021-05-20 15:20:43,t3_nh2zrs,,wallstreetbets,"So - this is another setup I've been watching closely for quite a long time. I've got two different charts I want to talk about today. For those who don't know, $EEM - or the iShares Emerging Markets ETF - is comprised of stocks from developing nations, with a **ton** of room to grow. These countries **will** all catch up soon, it's only a matter of time. This is one of the many reasons I find this setup especially interesting.

Here are the top holdings:

[$EEM Holdings \(By Country\)](https://preview.redd.it/zh7nwb2hfa071.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cb2749a2c7d6c7f548ad89a3f9a746b56d2273)

Next, let's dig into the charts -

Chart 1: **Max Monthly (\~16 Years)**

[$EEM Max Monthly](https://preview.redd.it/ylknrqzhea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=91ee9718b89c47744e6f68224a133c48c7bcfc6f)

Here you can see we have a **symmetrical triangle** pattern that dates back to late 2007. In technical analysis, the longer the pattern has been building, the more significant the breakout will be. Subsequently - you can imagine the magnitude a pattern like this has.

When making new all time highs I like to look for psychological resistances. As a result - logical targets for this pattern are **75.00, 100.00.** Sounds simple, but it works in practice. Keep in mind - something like this will take **3 - 5 years** to play out. This is a position trade.

In order for this breakout to stay valid - we need to continue getting monthly closes above **50.85.** You can see we've pretty much gone perfectly sideways since breaking out for **4 months** now.

This is **bullish -** moving sideways in a higher range is always biased to the upside (except in special situations with certain reversal patterns). Not only that, but we've been forming an interesting setup on the next chart I will show you all -

Chart 2: **1 Year 1 Day**

[$EEM 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/7hy7wbqeea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8102c5b1f0e92c02260cfccc6b8d77eafea8035d)

On this chart - you can make much more sense of those 4 months of sideways. We are actually working on a large **falling wedge** \- which is a bullish continuation pattern. The breakout point for this is sitting around **54.37** as I am writing this (5/20/2021).

Upon breaking this (ignoring the previous chart) - we would target **54.94, 56.49, 57.32, 60.00, 65.00.** That would be if there was no setup on the monthly chart. Each of these are resistances we could stop and consolidate at. I like to scale in after breaking each resistance. Scale into winners and cut losers fast. A break from a pattern like this would probably take **3 - 6 months** to play out.

I also want to note that **MASSIVE** increase in volume on 3/26. Generally - an uptick on volume when price is doing what you want it to is always a plus. But one like that is very intriguing - on a huge green candle too. My guess would be someone loaded their bags there (or a group of players).

And... **that's it.** Keep it simple. Those are often the best setups.

***TL;DR -***

$EEM has a big pattern - broke out 4 months ago just chopping sideways waiting for the move to happen.

Price targets **75.00, 100.00**

Stop out below **50.87** monthly close

Timeframe **3-5 years**

It also has a smaller pattern above that one - which breaks out above **54.37** and has a shorter time horizon.

Price targets **60.00, 65.00**

Stop out if we close back inside

Timeframe **3-6 months**

***Positions -***

10% of my long term portfolio is in emerging markets ETFs and,

\- Research coming out of John Hopkins University is suggesting that the use of Psilocybin is the most effective drug ever tested as a remedy for depression, anxiety, and PTSD. As the United States is currently under crisis in its battle against mental illness, these results are too impressive to ignore, even if it may need to overcome pressures from big pharma interest groups that seek to quell the expansion of this research.

\- These drugs have been extremely effective in treating addiction -- particularly alcohol and nicotine. Considering the government expenditure on the opioid crisis, once this proves to be an effective treatment, the government will expedite the medicinal legalization of the substances that MNMD has been treating/experimenting with.

\- Veterans, the most respected occupational category (statistically,) have begun launching advocacy groups for the widespread medicinal legalization of these substances due to their effectiveness against PTSD. These therapeutic measures have contributed to the plummeting of suicide rates (those treated w/ psilocybin vs. control group.) The Biden administration will have to choose ethics and reason over the suffering of veterans (former government employees) which I anticipate that they will given mounting pressure due to the effectiveness of these treatments.

Does this hinge on expected earnings in the long-run ... certainly!

But the effectiveness of this research is undeniable and can no longer be overlooked ... because of new cultural acceptance of these alternative treatments the government's hand will be forced in legalize, or otherwise be responsible for mental illness and addiction -- all of which could be treated and cured.

If you aren't familiar with the efficient frontier, what it tries to find is the *mean-variance portfolio.* This type of model deals with portfolio management / optimization. In terms of the efficient frontier you are trying to find the best portfolio allocation weights that give you the best risk adjusted returns. 

**In simple words:** you give it stocks and it tells you the best percentage holdings

I recently built an app on some python code that does this sort of optimization. There is no programming required to use the app. When running the app it will give two portfolios, minimum variance, and maximized sharpe (same as mean-variance, mean-markowitz). Minimum variance will tell you the least riskiest holding strategy (green), and max sharpe will give you the best reward-for-risk holding (red). I call that portfolio *the-juice-is-worth-the-squeeze.* Here is a sample output.

I used around 100,000 simulations, and 10Y of adjusted close data. 

The reason why I bring this up is because it does two things. The first is that it promotes portfolio diversification, which I know is pretty uncommon here. Also it finds the most aggressive returns in terms of minimizing risk. If you have high returns and wonder why you returns are so much higher than standard investment funds its probably because you are here

Yah you may good returns, you are probably taking on more risk than what you are getting in return.

How high could it go? Well If we take a look at the graph below, we can see that SPCE peaked at around 60 bucks  back in February in ANTICIPATION for the previous test flight which was delayed until May for safety reasons (They had some problems with electromagnetic interference which is fixed now).

Currently the price is around 18-19 bucks, so it's an absolute steal in my opinion, but there is always the risk that some shit fucks up and the test flight is delayed even further, in which case I will have to sell the house.

#Topics of discussion:

* Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks

* WDC Fundamentals

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

I believe the technology will allow for a more personal approach in the field of medicine, and should not be viewed solely as a research-based company.  

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community.

* **Earnings beat expectations in Q1 2021.**
* **Recent large insider procurement.**

There are some negative indicators fundamentally, but considering Bionano is still in its infancy I am very optimistic in my outlook. The positives tip the scale in my opinion and at the very least, Bianano Genomics (BNGO) should be on your watchlist!

A little bit about myself for context:

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",nh8f2j,PUBM DD #1

2620,,2021-05-20 19:09:28,t3_nh8q8x,,wallstreetbets," So this is the first time I've ever played around with options and I'm probably doing it in a dumb way but get that's more fun for you guys to watch. I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let‚Äôs go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don‚Äôt need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there‚Äôs a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

W-shape with today's price action.

* For the w-shape to hold true we need to push over 418.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418.
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

However I was deep thinking, so I started digging.  We never recovered from the 08 crisis.  They just dropped interest rates and turned on the printer.  

Now in 11-12 I was a security guard for a company that made coins for the us mint/ tiff jewelry.  Gold was crazy 16-1700$ an once.  It‚Äôs gone up 150-200$ an oz in the decade where we printed more money than we have since our founding. 

What if the government knew they were fucked and told hedge funds to naked short everything till oblivion. 


Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there‚Äôs at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don‚Äôt have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.  

Apes look up academic papers from the 08 collapse and what‚Äôs going on now naked shorting is on the rise.

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

TLDR; BIGC good, like SHOP, but undervalued.

Inflation is gonna destroy non-asset holders. I‚Äôm a bit worried about discount retail (5 below, DG, Dollar Tree) holding up because the business models are predicated on selling commodities at a certain price point. If commodity prices skyrocket dollar tree especially is gonna have a tough time adjusting since literally everything in their store is a dollar. So I think the better bet is to buy the actual companies that create goods that the poor are capable of buying (since inflation will eradicate much of the middle class.) Vizio products would never be sold in one of these stores but they sell really cheap TVs with internet accessibility. They sell a really good product considering the price point. I check their books and it‚Äôs a profitable company that‚Äôs been improving margins that last two years. Pretty low market cap so I wouldn‚Äôt be shocked if a larger company sought to buy it in the future. Worth ripping OTM yolos for the next two years",nhlgkk,Vizio: A Macroeconomic perspective
2661,,2021-05-21 07:40:32,t3_nhmv7n,,wallstreetbets,"Ford is great value investment considering it will compete with TESLA for EV market - Most of bear case is ford debt and they are 100% wrong. Please read below article.

**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    
**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford‚Äôs finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford‚Äôs automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford‚Äôs $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford‚Äôs $160 billion debt load.

From old post:

1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

2663,,2021-05-21 09:36:45,t3_nhoi3w,,wallstreetbets,"Virgin Galactic announced they have a test flight scheduled for tomorrow and the stock moved up by 14% yesterday. I‚Äôm overall bearish on this company, as founder Richard Branson and SPAC-backer Chamath Palihapitiya have both sold basically all of their shares. Cathie Woods doesn‚Äôt even own it for ARK. 

I want to buy puts in anticipation of a drop Monday, this seems like the most likely outcome to me. Whether the launch is a failure or people just sell the news after a big move, it seems unlikely that it continues to rally Monday. There‚Äôs a lot of bag holders who bought at $40-60 a couple months ago that would love to get out if it bounces which would theoretically limit its possible gains Monday. On the chance the test flight greatly exceeds expectations or there is another announcement included along side the test, the stock could fly however. I feel that this is a slim but non-zero possibility. Basically whichever way it moves, it‚Äôs going to move hard. June 4th options have an IV of 165% per thinkorswim. 

My question is whether I am better off buying straight puts on $SPCE or if I should buy some sort of call/put spread to hedge my downside in the event the stock continues to fly Monday. My main concern is making the right move and still getting IV crushed. I‚Äôm looking at 6/4/21 $20 puts, or a spread at the same strike and expiry. In your opinions, is that a smart move or is there something else I should be considering? I‚Äôm still relatively new to trading options. 

Thanks for your input!

2667,,2021-05-21 11:44:07,t3_nhqhhk,,wallstreetbets,"Explosive fires have started everywhere already. Stock markets are on fire and so are property markets, as well as bond and debt markets. The problem is that fires are initially explosive but always end up implosive. 

How predictable events are (and people). This is particularly true in the world economy. Empires come and go, economies boom and bust and new currencies come and without fail always go. All this happens with regularity. 

&#x200B;

 Everything really on fire :

 We have seen  about inflation running wild and it is not just happening in stocks. Property markets are literarily exploding, especially the high end. We see this all over the world and not just in the US. In the UK for example, HSBC stated that March saw the highest number of mortgages EVER issued. In Sweden properties sell for up to 40% above asking price in a frenzied bidding war and second hand leisure boats are in such demand that they cost virtually the same as a new boat. And if you want a new boat, there is none available until 2022. It also seems that people are desperate for company after the lockdowns as prices for puppies in the UK are up to 100% higher than last year.

 Yes, everything is really on fire as people are desperate to just spend, spend, spend after a year of lockdowns and restrictions. 

 AN ECONOMIC BUBBLE OF AIR

 Since air is free, governments can produce unlimited amounts of it. And without exception, gullible people want to believe that it is actually real money and not just empty air. The beauty for the government is that they can just produce and borrow trillions of dollars at ZERO cost. And by manipulating interest rates they can borrow this money also at virtually ZERO cost. 

 So first the government manufactures the money at no cost and then they pay NOTHING for the privilege of borrowing that money. 

 The money obviously creates massive bubbles in stocks, bonds, houses, used cars , boats, puppies and other massively overvalued investments and consumer items. 

 Just look at how, for example, the Dow has gone up **exponentially and parabolically** **in the last year in an historically unprecedented straight line.** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lnjdj8xvlg071.png?width=461&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a5b514632f262f311d158e14416251b98f6d00e

 

**US Federal Debt up 74X**  
**Total US debt up ‚Äúonly‚Äù 49X**  
**M2 Money Supply up 29X>**

**Debt to GDP 1971: 37% ‚Äì 2021: 127%**

 Bubbles are called bubbles because they consist of air. And when bubbles become too big, they ALWAYS and without fail burst and implode. 

 Technically markets are giving very clear signals that THE END IS NIGH.

Whether that means days weeks or a few months, is totally irrelevant. We know that we are at the end of the most remarkable period in history in regards to money, investments and the economy.

 GOLD, SILVER AND WEALTH PRESERVATION

Gold  and Silver  have not at all reflected the massive creation of money in the last 50 years. That catchup phase is likely to start very soon based on both fundamentals and technicals. 

As regards securing your finances in periods of crisis, gold and silver have always been critical to hold.

 Everyone can afford some gold or silver. An ounce of silver is $28 and one gramme of gold is $50. So saving in precious metals will not only be very useful but essential at whatever level you can afford.

 The upside potential for gold and silver is multiples of the current prices and that is at today‚Äôs price levels. Higher inflation could take the metals to unfathomable heights.

2669,,2021-05-21 12:45:14,t3_nhrmu8,,wallstreetbets,"FuboTV posted its Q1 results on the 11th. Seasonality in sports is obviously huge, with Q1 and Q2 being the worst periods of the season.

Consequently, there was always a sequential decline in the number of subscribers in Q1 and Q2 in 2019 and 2020. Typically between -8 and -9% sequentially. Given the amazing performance that was achieved in Q3 and Q4 last year, it was heavily expected that this Q1 would again see a decline in paid subscribers.

And then the results were published. For the first time in its history, Fubo delivered a sequential growth in paid subscribers and revenue in a Q1! The inflection point as been passed, the business momentum is stronger than the seasonality of sports. Looking ahead, with the Olympics, the soccer world cup qualifiers, the main leagues restarting everywhere, I expect massive growth in paid subscribers.

Now, onto the revenue side. The ARPU is approximately constant at around 69$/month since Q3 2020. The low seasonality of Q1 means that the relative share of ARPU due to the advertising is quite low compared to Q3 and Q4 last year. Which means that a great improvement of the subscription ARPU has been reached in Q1!

Now, when we'll go into Q3 and then Q4, with the absurd growth in number of subscribers and the massive gains from advertising, I'm expecting the ARPU to again grow. Expected advertising growth is 100% YOY.

And what happens when you combine massive subscribers and ARPU growth? You have massive results.

The cherries on the cake are:

1. Fubo betting which comes as a free version in Q3 and then paid version in Q4. It can be massive as Fubo will be the only player in the industry to control end to end the viewer/bettor experience.
2. International expansion, in Europe first probably, starting in 2022.
3. Accepting wagering in unconventional currencies.

The potential is so large it's not a cherry anymore, but rather a pineapple on the cake üççüéÇ

I know, in the last week many talked about a possible future crash in the stock market, inflation and there is too much liquidity and bla bla bla. I am not here to say the next crash will occur this October or on any other date (I well know that correlation is not causation). I have no subtle purpose to share, it's just for the curiosity of this pattern.

p.s. Probably the cause is because October is my birthday.

I don't know if there is something to discuss this, but I would appreciate your opinions.

This isn‚Äôt some wishy washy bullshit oh it‚Äôs going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it‚Äôs just a question of when. How can I be so sure? They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.

Should you trust me?

Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago? We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can‚Äôt lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist? What the fuck does that mean ‚Äì fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill. Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn‚Äôt just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine ‚Äì kind of a big deal. They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year. Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe ‚Äì think FDA is going to delay?

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no. They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted. Added bonus ‚Äì Pfizer‚Äôs big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also ‚Äì or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain‚Äôt going cheap. They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner. Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn‚Äôt allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth. The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes ‚Äì former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius ‚Äì not piece of shit pharma we have here. Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks. You don‚Äôt have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear. No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential? Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities ‚Äì hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men‚Äôs lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself. Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant‚Äôs drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued. MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down - whatever could they do with that cash? $44 a share wouldn‚Äôt even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down. With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in ‚Äì remember this isn‚Äôt some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them. And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can‚Äôt see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone. FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they‚Äôve already approved in new indications like this one. Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point.

It was Congressionally mandated in the last stimulus bill and gave the government 180 days to release an unclassified report to the general public and a classified report to congress. We are approaching that time, and June/July could be a heavy shift in perspectives and R&D priorities. [Sen.

These UAP‚Äôs exhibit unexplainable flight characteristics: near instantaneous acceleration, airplane/submersible hybrid characteristics, visual disappearance, odd acoustics, etc. Also, multiple ‚Äútypes‚Äù of craft have been observed. 

There are patents filed by the Navy for inertial mass reduction craft (basically creating a quantum vacuum around the craft to avoid air/water resistance; useful to go Mach 16+ in the atmosphere). Here‚Äôs the patent: [Triangular UAP Patent?](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10144532B2/en). Additionally, we have heard rumors (and they may just be rumors) of anti-gravity temporal displacement craft. These craft can accelerate by utilizing gravity waves, bend light through a gravity well (stealthy), and externally perceived time could be affected as well (think Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar) ([Gravity Wave Patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10322827B2/) ) This UAP sightings might be manned craft or something else, or a mixture of both. These patents could also be counter-espionage missions to throw foreign countries off true technological breakthroughs, but we do know there was a demo of the tech: [Navy acknowledging demo, but not production ready](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/37134/emails-show-navys-ufo-patents-went-through-significant-internal-review-resulted-in-a-demo)

Okay great, so what‚Äôs the play‚Ä¶

**Long-Raytheon ($RTX)** has the Advanced Targeting Forward Look Infrared Sensor, which can be utilized to track UAP‚Äôs. This technology has been out for over a decade. Additionally, Raytheon is the go-to company for research into lasers, targeted radiation, or proton beams (still no word on proton torpedoes). ([UFO Targeting Pod](https://sofrep.com/news/following-pentagon-admission-raytheon-touts-gear-ufo-spotter/))

**Long-Lockheed Martin ($LMT)** a major defense aerospace firm, which developed many prototypes over the years and is famous for the Skunkworks R&D lab. Former Senator Harry Reid believes Lockheed has UAP fragments in their possession ([UAP Fragments](https://deadline.com/2021/04/ufo-fragments-in-possession-lockheed-martin-says-harry-reid-1234748095/)). These fragments are believed to be made of an unknown metal/alloy, and potentially 3D printed at an atomic level.

**Long-Northrup Grumman ($NOC)** is a defense giant which developed the B-2 stealth bomber and is a contractor on multiple space infrastructure missions. They would be vital for advanced composites/metallurgy, advanced avionics, spaceflight, and tracking systems.

Additionally, we have no clear knowledge of where the Chinese and Russians are at with this technology. Maybe this is partly why we founded Space Force?

Don't feel like writing a wall of text but want to warn others who are thinking of switching into them so I'm just going to bullet point problems I've had.  If you are with them already and feel so-so about them... there are better options out there.  Moving money is a pain in the ass but it might be worth it.

**Issues I've had with them**

* Margin approval is like pulling teeth.  They want to grill you to death for like half an hour and slowly increase your options approval one step at a time (honestly some of those guys seem like idiots and I'm not sure how they got their certifications).  If they don't like exactly how you answer questions even as an experienced trader that's been doing it for a while, they will delay your application by up to 6 months before you can try again.  That hasn't happened to me fortunately but apparently they do that so I'm always very anxious talking to them.  I have $600k ish with them in all my accounts and my risk per trade is typically capped at $50-60k.  I tend to have extra cash if I need to average down or add something to hedge my position.  Never used margin even though I have it since it's required to do a lot of different trades.

* Frequent outages (especially at market open), error messages, slow to load in the browser portal.  Desktop platform ""StreetSmart"" is terrible IMO but I suppose that is a matter of taste.  They're portal option trading is otherwise aright, I've seen better and worse but nothing to write home about.

* $1k recently mysteriously disappeared in my account.  They were quick to correct it and apparently it's some ""very rare"" programming error but who the fuck knows for sure.  I'm sure a lot of retards out there don't even notice if money is ever missing.

* Finally, something that has always bothered me is that their execution doesn't seem that good.  With options especially +/- a couple pennies or (or nickel for larger contracts) can actually make a huge difference on your P&L for a trade.  They are THE LEADER in PFOF revenue.  Fuck them.

\- Research coming out of John Hopkins University is suggesting that the use of Psilocybin is the most effective drug ever tested as a remedy for depression, anxiety, and PTSD. As the United States is currently under crisis in its battle against mental illness, these results are too impressive to ignore, even if it may need to overcome pressures from big pharma interest groups that seek to quell the expansion of this research.

\- These drugs have been extremely effective in treating addiction -- particularly alcohol and nicotine. Considering the government expenditure on the opioid crisis, once this proves to be an effective treatment, the government will expedite the medicinal legalization of the substances that MNMD has been treating/experimenting with.

\- Veterans, the most respected occupational category (statistically,) have begun launching advocacy groups for the widespread medicinal legalization of these substances due to their effectiveness against PTSD. These therapeutic measures have contributed to the plummeting of suicide rates (those treated w/ psilocybin vs. control group.) The Biden administration will have to choose ethics and reason over the suffering of veterans (former government employees) which I anticipate that they will given mounting pressure due to the effectiveness of these treatments.

&#x200B;

Does this hinge on expected earnings in the long-run ... certainly!

&#x200B;

But the effectiveness of this research is undeniable and can no longer be overlooked ... because of new cultural acceptance of these alternative treatments the government's hand will be forced in legalize, or otherwise be responsible for mental illness and addiction -- all of which could be treated and cured.

2871,,2021-05-20 16:06:53,t3_nh45af,,wallstreetbets,"I want to first start off by saying that I'm not liable for financial losses. I recently built an app that can generate efficient frontiers when you plug in individual US Equities. 

If you aren't familiar with the efficient frontier, what it tries to find is the *mean-variance portfolio.* This type of model deals with portfolio management / optimization. In terms of the efficient frontier you are trying to find the best portfolio allocation weights that give you the best risk adjusted returns. 

**In simple words:** you give it stocks and it tells you the best percentage holdings

I recently built an app on some python code that does this sort of optimization. There is no programming required to use the app. When running the app it will give two portfolios, minimum variance, and maximized sharpe (same as mean-variance, mean-markowitz). Minimum variance will tell you the least riskiest holding strategy (green), and max sharpe will give you the best reward-for-risk holding (red). I call that portfolio *the-juice-is-worth-the-squeeze.* Here is a sample output. 

&#x200B;

I used around 100,000 simulations, and 10Y of adjusted close data. 

The reason why I bring this up is because it does two things. The first is that it promotes portfolio diversification, which I know is pretty uncommon here. Also it finds the most aggressive returns in terms of minimizing risk. If you have high returns and wonder why you returns are so much higher than standard investment funds its probably because you are here

Yah you may good returns, you are probably taking on more risk than what you are getting in return.

&#x200B;

**If your brain has folds in it:**

Essentially the code is using a monte carlo simulation to solve this optimization problem.

https://preview.redd.it/atjw6r0lza071.png?width=604&format=png&auto=webp&s=5dee70e4fcf252de71da4829d35816b716396bd4

  
How high could it go? Well If we take a look at the graph below, we can see that SPCE peaked at around 60 bucks  back in February in ANTICIPATION for the previous test flight which was delayed until May for safety reasons (They had some problems with electromagnetic interference which is fixed now). 

https://preview.redd.it/7gkt6q2b0b071.png?width=709&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf751660b6ec987adb3614000e9d1d19f4dd6b7b

So if the test flight actually happens on the 22nd, then could be really big boom. Currently the price is around 18-19 bucks, so it's an absolute steal in my opinion, but there is always the risk that some shit fucks up and the test flight is delayed even further, in which case I will have to sell the house.

And before any of you autistic fucks say that SpaceX is better, just keep in mind that Virgin Galactic is playing a whole different game. SpaceX is trying to go to Mars, and Virgin Galactic is just trying to do some space tourism. Also keep in mind that Virgin Galactic was founded 2 whole years after SpaceX, so SpaceX has had a bit of a head start.

There is a new kind of this currency that uses a lot of computer storage space. How much? Well - 7 EXABYTES and it's currently adding 1 exabyte every 3 days. I'm going to assume you know about this currency and if not you can look through my post history and see which subreddit I've posted to recently involving this particular one.

#Topics of discussion:

* Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks

* WDC Fundamentals

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

I believe the technology will allow for a more personal approach in the field of medicine, and should not be viewed solely as a research-based company.  

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community.

A little bit about myself for context:

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/555339dhob071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42585b1cfe4cf1c85eab62b0cc01791f5321f1e2

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",nh8f2j,PUBM DD #1

I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let‚Äôs go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don‚Äôt need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there‚Äôs a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

UWMC has had a better post-earnings period not because their top line YOY growth was so good or even indicative of something remotely possible to sustain moving forward, but really just because of the dividend and chest pounding against RKT.

I have a position in both, and before either camp starts screaming about how one is more revolutionary, or has better blah blah blah, realize that the only thing driving price action for either is public sentiment. UWMC declared a regular dividend while RKT only a special.

It might be to their advantage to do so because they are able to profit off of the availability of COMEX -- but at what price?  
In other words, saving COMEX yet again may be becoming just too *expensive* for JPM's bean counters/risk managers.  
Or maybe they simply don't have the available unencumbered silver to do this with any longer.  
JPM and their billion ounce mountain of silver may be a paper tiger. 

&#x200B;

Lets dign in !

**Comex silver warehouse .... another 1,000,000 oz is OUT OF THE VAULT, 43,000,000 oz is gone since the silverbacks arrived. This time it is all HSBC bank. And what did big powerful JP Morgan do? Nothing!! Maybe all their silver eligible is spoken for.** 

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418.
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there‚Äôs at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don‚Äôt have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

Inflation is gonna destroy non-asset holders. I‚Äôm a bit worried about discount retail (5 below, DG, Dollar Tree) holding up because the business models are predicated on selling commodities at a certain price point. If commodity prices skyrocket dollar tree especially is gonna have a tough time adjusting since literally everything in their store is a dollar. So I think the better bet is to buy the actual companies that create goods that the poor are capable of buying (since inflation will eradicate much of the middle class.) Vizio products would never be sold in one of these stores but they sell really cheap TVs with internet accessibility. They sell a really good product considering the price point. I check their books and it‚Äôs a profitable company that‚Äôs been improving margins that last two years. Pretty low market cap so I wouldn‚Äôt be shocked if a larger company sought to buy it in the future. Worth ripping OTM yolos for the next two years",nhlgkk,Vizio: A Macroeconomic perspective
2926,,2021-05-21 07:40:32,t3_nhmv7n,,wallstreetbets,"Ford is great value investment considering it will compete with TESLA for EV market - Most of bear case is ford debt and they are 100% wrong. Please read below article.

**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    
**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford‚Äôs finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford‚Äôs automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford‚Äôs $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford‚Äôs $160 billion debt load.

From old post:

1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

2928,,2021-05-21 09:36:45,t3_nhoi3w,,wallstreetbets,"Virgin Galactic announced they have a test flight scheduled for tomorrow and the stock moved up by 14% yesterday. I‚Äôm overall bearish on this company, as founder Richard Branson and SPAC-backer Chamath Palihapitiya have both sold basically all of their shares. Cathie Woods doesn‚Äôt even own it for ARK. 

I want to buy puts in anticipation of a drop Monday, this seems like the most likely outcome to me. Whether the launch is a failure or people just sell the news after a big move, it seems unlikely that it continues to rally Monday. There‚Äôs a lot of bag holders who bought at $40-60 a couple months ago that would love to get out if it bounces which would theoretically limit its possible gains Monday. On the chance the test flight greatly exceeds expectations or there is another announcement included along side the test, the stock could fly however. I feel that this is a slim but non-zero possibility. Basically whichever way it moves, it‚Äôs going to move hard. June 4th options have an IV of 165% per thinkorswim. 

My question is whether I am better off buying straight puts on $SPCE or if I should buy some sort of call/put spread to hedge my downside in the event the stock continues to fly Monday. My main concern is making the right move and still getting IV crushed. I‚Äôm looking at 6/4/21 $20 puts, or a spread at the same strike and expiry. In your opinions, is that a smart move or is there something else I should be considering? I‚Äôm still relatively new to trading options.

2932,,2021-05-21 11:44:07,t3_nhqhhk,,wallstreetbets,"Explosive fires have started everywhere already. Stock markets are on fire and so are property markets, as well as bond and debt markets. The problem is that fires are initially explosive but always end up implosive. 

How predictable events are (and people). This is particularly true in the world economy. Empires come and go, economies boom and bust and new currencies come and without fail always go. All this happens with regularity. 

&#x200B;

 Everything really on fire :

 We have seen  about inflation running wild and it is not just happening in stocks. Property markets are literarily exploding, especially the high end. We see this all over the world and not just in the US. In the UK for example, HSBC stated that March saw the highest number of mortgages EVER issued. In Sweden properties sell for up to 40% above asking price in a frenzied bidding war and second hand leisure boats are in such demand that they cost virtually the same as a new boat. And if you want a new boat, there is none available until 2022. It also seems that people are desperate for company after the lockdowns as prices for puppies in the UK are up to 100% higher than last year.

 Yes, everything is really on fire as people are desperate to just spend, spend, spend after a year of lockdowns and restrictions. 

 AN ECONOMIC BUBBLE OF AIR

 Since air is free, governments can produce unlimited amounts of it. And without exception, gullible people want to believe that it is actually real money and not just empty air. The beauty for the government is that they can just produce and borrow trillions of dollars at ZERO cost. And by manipulating interest rates they can borrow this money also at virtually ZERO cost. 

 So first the government manufactures the money at no cost and then they pay NOTHING for the privilege of borrowing that money. 

 The money obviously creates massive bubbles in stocks, bonds, houses, used cars , boats, puppies and other massively overvalued investments and consumer items. 

 Just look at how, for example, the Dow has gone up **exponentially and parabolically** **in the last year in an historically unprecedented straight line.** 

&#x200B;

**US Federal Debt up 74X**  
**Total US debt up ‚Äúonly‚Äù 49X**  
**M2 Money Supply up 29X>**

**Debt to GDP 1971: 37% ‚Äì 2021: 127%**

 Bubbles are called bubbles because they consist of air. And when bubbles become too big, they ALWAYS and without fail burst and implode. 

 Technically markets are giving very clear signals that THE END IS NIGH.

Whether that means days weeks or a few months, is totally irrelevant. We know that we are at the end of the most remarkable period in history in regards to money, investments and the economy.

 GOLD, SILVER AND WEALTH PRESERVATION

Gold  and Silver  have not at all reflected the massive creation of money in the last 50 years. That catchup phase is likely to start very soon based on both fundamentals and technicals. 

As regards securing your finances in periods of crisis, gold and silver have always been critical to hold.

 Everyone can afford some gold or silver. An ounce of silver is $28 and one gramme of gold is $50. So saving in precious metals will not only be very useful but essential at whatever level you can afford.

 The upside potential for gold and silver is multiples of the current prices and that is at today‚Äôs price levels. Higher inflation could take the metals to unfathomable heights.

2934,,2021-05-21 12:45:14,t3_nhrmu8,,wallstreetbets,"FuboTV posted its Q1 results on the 11th. Seasonality in sports is obviously huge, with Q1 and Q2 being the worst periods of the season.

Consequently, there was always a sequential decline in the number of subscribers in Q1 and Q2 in 2019 and 2020. Typically between -8 and -9% sequentially. Given the amazing performance that was achieved in Q3 and Q4 last year, it was heavily expected that this Q1 would again see a decline in paid subscribers.

And then the results were published. For the first time in its history, Fubo delivered a sequential growth in paid subscribers and revenue in a Q1! The inflection point as been passed, the business momentum is stronger than the seasonality of sports. Looking ahead, with the Olympics, the soccer world cup qualifiers, the main leagues restarting everywhere, I expect massive growth in paid subscribers.

Now, onto the revenue side. The ARPU is approximately constant at around 69$/month since Q3 2020. The low seasonality of Q1 means that the relative share of ARPU due to the advertising is quite low compared to Q3 and Q4 last year. Which means that a great improvement of the subscription ARPU has been reached in Q1!

Now, when we'll go into Q3 and then Q4, with the absurd growth in number of subscribers and the massive gains from advertising, I'm expecting the ARPU to again grow. Expected advertising growth is 100% YOY.

And what happens when you combine massive subscribers and ARPU growth? You have massive results.

The cherries on the cake are:

1. Fubo betting which comes as a free version in Q3 and then paid version in Q4. It can be massive as Fubo will be the only player in the industry to control end to end the viewer/bettor experience.
2. International expansion, in Europe first probably, starting in 2022.
3. Accepting wagering in unconventional currencies.

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes ‚Äì well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you‚Äôll double your money. This isn‚Äôt some wishy washy bullshit oh it‚Äôs going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it‚Äôs just a question of when. How can I be so sure? They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.

Should you trust me? Am I financial advisor ‚Äì good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips. Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago? We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can‚Äôt lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist? What the fuck does that mean ‚Äì fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill. Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn‚Äôt just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine ‚Äì kind of a big deal. They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year. Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe ‚Äì think FDA is going to delay?

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no. They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted. Added bonus ‚Äì Pfizer‚Äôs big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also ‚Äì or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain‚Äôt going cheap. They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner. Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn‚Äôt allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth. The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes ‚Äì former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius ‚Äì not piece of shit pharma we have here. Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks. You don‚Äôt have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear. No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential? Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities ‚Äì hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men‚Äôs lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself. Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant‚Äôs drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued. MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down - whatever could they do with that cash? $44 a share wouldn‚Äôt even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down. With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in ‚Äì remember this isn‚Äôt some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them. And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can‚Äôt see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone. FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they‚Äôve already approved in new indications like this one. Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point. It‚Äôs down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason. FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density ‚Äì the solution: they will monitor bone density. That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer. Even if they don‚Äôt Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs. Truly can‚Äôt fucking lose. so why is it trading so cheap?

**Legitimate company and not a meme?** Yes. 

20 year old company with a solid balance sheet, solid earnings, profitable every quarter, and beat EPS consistently all of last year. Every damn quarter they provided positive guidance, yet the wallstreet cucks would still under-cut their expectations, only for CSIQ to crush earnings.

**Does it have a future?** Yes

They make fucking solar panels, and have been doing it for 20 years! Tesla solar roofs are meme products. When my employer wanted to add solar panels for our 3 factories, we didn't call up Tesla. We called up a EPC firm who chose Canadian Solar as the supplier.

**What are the numbers?** Yes.

Lots of cash, lots of assets, low debt, consistent income etc.

**Are there any catalysts that would make it moon?** Yes

**Positions?** Yes

600 shares since 2012. I bought them when I started making real money in my adult job. I was an intern at Canadian Solar in 2009.

It was Congressionally mandated in the last stimulus bill and gave the government 180 days to release an unclassified report to the general public and a classified report to congress. We are approaching that time, and June/July could be a heavy shift in perspectives and R&D priorities. [Sen. Rubio's Comments](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ufo-reports-should-be-taken-seriously-rubio-says-11621245038) [WaPo Article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/03/23/ufo-report-covid-bill/)

These UAP‚Äôs exhibit unexplainable flight characteristics: near instantaneous acceleration, airplane/submersible hybrid characteristics, visual disappearance, odd acoustics, etc. Also, multiple ‚Äútypes‚Äù of craft have been observed. 

There are patents filed by the Navy for inertial mass reduction craft (basically creating a quantum vacuum around the craft to avoid air/water resistance; useful to go Mach 16+ in the atmosphere). Here‚Äôs the patent: [Triangular UAP Patent?](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10144532B2/en). Additionally, we have heard rumors (and they may just be rumors) of anti-gravity temporal displacement craft. These craft can accelerate by utilizing gravity waves, bend light through a gravity well (stealthy), and externally perceived time could be affected as well (think Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar) ([Gravity Wave Patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10322827B2/) ) This UAP sightings might be manned craft or something else, or a mixture of both. These patents could also be counter-espionage missions to throw foreign countries off true technological breakthroughs, but we do know there was a demo of the tech: [Navy acknowledging demo, but not production ready](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/37134/emails-show-navys-ufo-patents-went-through-significant-internal-review-resulted-in-a-demo)

Okay great, so what‚Äôs the play‚Ä¶

**Long-Raytheon ($RTX)** has the Advanced Targeting Forward Look Infrared Sensor, which can be utilized to track UAP‚Äôs. This technology has been out for over a decade. Additionally, Raytheon is the go-to company for research into lasers, targeted radiation, or proton beams (still no word on proton torpedoes). ([UFO Targeting Pod](https://sofrep.com/news/following-pentagon-admission-raytheon-touts-gear-ufo-spotter/))

**Long-Lockheed Martin ($LMT)** a major defense aerospace firm, which developed many prototypes over the years and is famous for the Skunkworks R&D lab. Former Senator Harry Reid believes Lockheed has UAP fragments in their possession ([UAP Fragments](https://deadline.com/2021/04/ufo-fragments-in-possession-lockheed-martin-says-harry-reid-1234748095/)). These fragments are believed to be made of an unknown metal/alloy, and potentially 3D printed at an atomic level.

**Long-Northrup Grumman ($NOC)** is a defense giant which developed the B-2 stealth bomber and is a contractor on multiple space infrastructure missions. They would be vital for advanced composites/metallurgy, advanced avionics, spaceflight, and tracking systems.

Additionally, we have no clear knowledge of where the Chinese and Russians are at with this technology. Maybe this is partly why we founded Space Force? This is a \~2 month play to see if we can get more decisive acknowledgement of the technology whether it is manned or alien, either way it could make for an interesting news summer.",nht2ep,The Alien Trade

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes ‚Äì well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you‚Äôll double your money.  This isn‚Äôt some wishy washy bullshit oh it‚Äôs going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it‚Äôs just a question of when.  How can I be so sure?  They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.  

Should you trust me?  Am I financial advisor ‚Äì good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips.  Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago?  We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can‚Äôt lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist?  What the fuck does that mean ‚Äì fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill.  Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.  

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn‚Äôt just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine ‚Äì kind of a big deal.  They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year.  Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe ‚Äì think FDA is going to delay? 

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no.  They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted.  Added bonus ‚Äì Pfizer‚Äôs big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also ‚Äì or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain‚Äôt going cheap.  They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner.  Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn‚Äôt allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth.  The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes ‚Äì former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius ‚Äì not piece of shit pharma we have here.  Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks.  You don‚Äôt have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear.  No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential?  Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities ‚Äì hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men‚Äôs lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself.  Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant‚Äôs drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued.  MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down  - whatever could they do with that cash?  $44 a share wouldn‚Äôt even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down.  With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in ‚Äì remember this isn‚Äôt some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them.  And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can‚Äôt see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone.  FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they‚Äôve already approved in new indications like this one.  Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point.  It‚Äôs down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason.  FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density ‚Äì the solution:  they will monitor bone density.  That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer.  Even if they don‚Äôt Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs.  Truly can‚Äôt fucking lose.  so why is it trading so cheap? Well cause no one knows about it, and the upside is only written down in Japanese.",nhtad9,Guaranteed Buyout and Doubling of Funds if buy Myovant (MYOV)

Can't believe I'm gonna throw shade on a firm I used to love but they have REALLY gone down hill.  Don't feel like writing a wall of text but want to warn others who are thinking of switching into them so I'm just going to bullet point problems I've had.  If you are with them already and feel so-so about them... there are better options out there.  Moving money is a pain in the ass but it might be worth it.

**Issues I've had with them**

* Margin approval is like pulling teeth.  They want to grill you to death for like half an hour and slowly increase your options approval one step at a time (honestly some of those guys seem like idiots and I'm not sure how they got their certifications).  If they don't like exactly how you answer questions even as an experienced trader that's been doing it for a while, they will delay your application by up to 6 months before you can try again.  That hasn't happened to me fortunately but apparently they do that so I'm always very anxious talking to them.  I have $600k ish with them in all my accounts and my risk per trade is typically capped at $50-60k.  I tend to have extra cash if I need to average down or add something to hedge my position.  Never used margin even though I have it since it's required to do a lot of different trades.

* Frequent outages (especially at market open), error messages, slow to load in the browser portal.  Desktop platform ""StreetSmart"" is terrible IMO but I suppose that is a matter of taste.  They're portal option trading is otherwise aright, I've seen better and worse but nothing to write home about.

* $1k recently mysteriously disappeared in my account.  They were quick to correct it and apparently it's some ""very rare"" programming error but who the fuck knows for sure.  I'm sure a lot of retards out there don't even notice if money is ever missing.

* Finally, something that has always bothered me is that their execution doesn't seem that good.  With options especially +/- a couple pennies or (or nickel for larger contracts) can actually make a huge difference on your P&L for a trade.  They are THE LEADER in PFOF revenue.  Fuck them.


When I joined them close to 20 years ago, I worshiped Charles Schwab.  You can google him but he was Good Guy broker when no one cared about retail back in the day.

The ad growth number was promising but still a paltry 6million.

Need to see tangible progress on Fubo bet. No idea what the product looks like rn or the cost to build and run. I‚Äôd personally like to see partnerships with mlb , nba etc where Fubo gains viewing content and data in return for a split of betting profits.

How high could it go? Well If we take a look at the graph below, we can see that SPCE peaked at around 60 bucks  back in February in ANTICIPATION for the previous test flight which was delayed until May for safety reasons (They had some problems with electromagnetic interference which is fixed now).

So if the test flight actually happens on the 22nd, then could be really big boom. Currently the price is around 18-19 bucks, so it's an absolute steal in my opinion, but there is always the risk that some shit fucks up and the test flight is delayed even further, in which case I will have to sell the house.

And before any of you autistic fucks say that SpaceX is better, just keep in mind that Virgin Galactic is playing a whole different game. SpaceX is trying to go to Mars, and Virgin Galactic is just trying to do some space tourism. Also keep in mind that Virgin Galactic was founded 2 whole years after SpaceX, so SpaceX has had a bit of a head start.

I'm going to assume you know about this currency and if not you can look through my post history and see which subreddit I've posted to recently involving this particular one.

#Topics of discussion:

* Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks

* WDC Fundamentals

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community.

A little bit about myself for context:

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/555339dhob071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42585b1cfe4cf1c85eab62b0cc01791f5321f1e2

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",nh8f2j,PUBM DD #1

I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let‚Äôs go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don‚Äôt need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there‚Äôs a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

UWMC has had a better post-earnings period not because their top line YOY growth was so good or even indicative of something remotely possible to sustain moving forward, but really just because of the dividend and chest pounding against RKT.

I have a position in both, and before either camp starts screaming about how one is more revolutionary, or has better blah blah blah, realize that the only thing driving price action for either is public sentiment. UWMC declared a regular dividend while RKT only a special.

It might be to their advantage to do so because they are able to profit off of the availability of COMEX -- but at what price?  
In other words, saving COMEX yet again may be becoming just too *expensive* for JPM's bean counters/risk managers.  
Or maybe they simply don't have the available unencumbered silver to do this with any longer.  
JPM and their billion ounce mountain of silver may be a paper tiger.

Lets dign in !

**Comex silver warehouse .... another 1,000,000 oz is OUT OF THE VAULT, 43,000,000 oz is gone since the silverbacks arrived. This time it is all HSBC bank. And what did big powerful JP Morgan do? Nothing!! Maybe all their silver eligible is spoken for.** 

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418.
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

Inflation is gonna destroy non-asset holders. I‚Äôm a bit worried about discount retail (5 below, DG, Dollar Tree) holding up because the business models are predicated on selling commodities at a certain price point. If commodity prices skyrocket dollar tree especially is gonna have a tough time adjusting since literally everything in their store is a dollar. So I think the better bet is to buy the actual companies that create goods that the poor are capable of buying (since inflation will eradicate much of the middle class.) Vizio products would never be sold in one of these stores but they sell really cheap TVs with internet accessibility. They sell a really good product considering the price point.

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford‚Äôs finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford‚Äôs automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford‚Äôs $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford‚Äôs $160 billion debt load.

This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

3241,,2021-05-21 09:36:45,t3_nhoi3w,,wallstreetbets,"Virgin Galactic announced they have a test flight scheduled for tomorrow and the stock moved up by 14% yesterday. I‚Äôm overall bearish on this company, as founder Richard Branson and SPAC-backer Chamath Palihapitiya have both sold basically all of their shares. Cathie Woods doesn‚Äôt even own it for ARK. 

I want to buy puts in anticipation of a drop Monday, this seems like the most likely outcome to me. Whether the launch is a failure or people just sell the news after a big move, it seems unlikely that it continues to rally Monday. There‚Äôs a lot of bag holders who bought at $40-60 a couple months ago that would love to get out if it bounces which would theoretically limit its possible gains Monday. On the chance the test flight greatly exceeds expectations or there is another announcement included along side the test, the stock could fly however. I feel that this is a slim but non-zero possibility. Basically whichever way it moves, it‚Äôs going to move hard. June 4th options have an IV of 165% per thinkorswim. 

My question is whether I am better off buying straight puts on $SPCE or if I should buy some sort of call/put spread to hedge my downside in the event the stock continues to fly Monday. My main concern is making the right move and still getting IV crushed. I‚Äôm looking at 6/4/21 $20 puts, or a spread at the same strike and expiry. In your opinions, is that a smart move or is there something else I should be considering? I‚Äôm still relatively new to trading options. 

Thanks for your input!

3245,,2021-05-21 11:44:07,t3_nhqhhk,,wallstreetbets,"Explosive fires have started everywhere already. Stock markets are on fire and so are property markets, as well as bond and debt markets. The problem is that fires are initially explosive but always end up implosive. 

How predictable events are (and people). This is particularly true in the world economy. Empires come and go, economies boom and bust and new currencies come and without fail always go. All this happens with regularity. 

&#x200B;

 Everything really on fire :

 We have seen  about inflation running wild and it is not just happening in stocks. Property markets are literarily exploding, especially the high end. We see this all over the world and not just in the US. In the UK for example, HSBC stated that March saw the highest number of mortgages EVER issued. In Sweden properties sell for up to 40% above asking price in a frenzied bidding war and second hand leisure boats are in such demand that they cost virtually the same as a new boat. And if you want a new boat, there is none available until 2022. It also seems that people are desperate for company after the lockdowns as prices for puppies in the UK are up to 100% higher than last year.

 Yes, everything is really on fire as people are desperate to just spend, spend, spend after a year of lockdowns and restrictions. 

 AN ECONOMIC BUBBLE OF AIR

 Since air is free, governments can produce unlimited amounts of it. And without exception, gullible people want to believe that it is actually real money and not just empty air. The beauty for the government is that they can just produce and borrow trillions of dollars at ZERO cost. And by manipulating interest rates they can borrow this money also at virtually ZERO cost. 

 So first the government manufactures the money at no cost and then they pay NOTHING for the privilege of borrowing that money. 

 The money obviously creates massive bubbles in stocks, bonds, houses, used cars , boats, puppies and other massively overvalued investments and consumer items. 

 Just look at how, for example, the Dow has gone up **exponentially and parabolically** **in the last year in an historically unprecedented straight line.** 

&#x200B;

**US Federal Debt up 74X**  
**Total US debt up ‚Äúonly‚Äù 49X**  
**M2 Money Supply up 29X>**

**Debt to GDP 1971: 37% ‚Äì 2021: 127%**

 Bubbles are called bubbles because they consist of air. And when bubbles become too big, they ALWAYS and without fail burst and implode. 

 Technically markets are giving very clear signals that THE END IS NIGH.

Whether that means days weeks or a few months, is totally irrelevant. We know that we are at the end of the most remarkable period in history in regards to money, investments and the economy.

 GOLD, SILVER AND WEALTH PRESERVATION

Gold  and Silver  have not at all reflected the massive creation of money in the last 50 years. That catchup phase is likely to start very soon based on both fundamentals and technicals. 

As regards securing your finances in periods of crisis, gold and silver have always been critical to hold.

 Everyone can afford some gold or silver. An ounce of silver is $28 and one gramme of gold is $50. So saving in precious metals will not only be very useful but essential at whatever level you can afford.

 The upside potential for gold and silver is multiples of the current prices and that is at today‚Äôs price levels. Higher inflation could take the metals to unfathomable heights.

3247,,2021-05-21 12:45:14,t3_nhrmu8,,wallstreetbets,"FuboTV posted its Q1 results on the 11th. Seasonality in sports is obviously huge, with Q1 and Q2 being the worst periods of the season.

Consequently, there was always a sequential decline in the number of subscribers in Q1 and Q2 in 2019 and 2020. Typically between -8 and -9% sequentially. Given the amazing performance that was achieved in Q3 and Q4 last year, it was heavily expected that this Q1 would again see a decline in paid subscribers.

And then the results were published. For the first time in its history, Fubo delivered a sequential growth in paid subscribers and revenue in a Q1! The inflection point as been passed, the business momentum is stronger than the seasonality of sports. Looking ahead, with the Olympics, the soccer world cup qualifiers, the main leagues restarting everywhere, I expect massive growth in paid subscribers.

Now, onto the revenue side. The ARPU is approximately constant at around 69$/month since Q3 2020. The low seasonality of Q1 means that the relative share of ARPU due to the advertising is quite low compared to Q3 and Q4 last year. Which means that a great improvement of the subscription ARPU has been reached in Q1!

Now, when we'll go into Q3 and then Q4, with the absurd growth in number of subscribers and the massive gains from advertising, I'm expecting the ARPU to again grow. Expected advertising growth is 100% YOY.

And what happens when you combine massive subscribers and ARPU growth? You have massive results.

The cherries on the cake are:

1. Fubo betting which comes as a free version in Q3 and then paid version in Q4. It can be massive as Fubo will be the only player in the industry to control end to end the viewer/bettor experience.
2. International expansion, in Europe first probably, starting in 2022.
3. Accepting wagering in unconventional currencies.

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes ‚Äì well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you‚Äôll double your money. This isn‚Äôt some wishy washy bullshit oh it‚Äôs going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it‚Äôs just a question of when. How can I be so sure? They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.

Should you trust me? Am I financial advisor ‚Äì good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips. Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago? We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can‚Äôt lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist? What the fuck does that mean ‚Äì fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill. Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn‚Äôt just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine ‚Äì kind of a big deal. They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year. Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe ‚Äì think FDA is going to delay?

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no. They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted. Added bonus ‚Äì Pfizer‚Äôs big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also ‚Äì or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain‚Äôt going cheap. They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner. Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn‚Äôt allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth. The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes ‚Äì former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius ‚Äì not piece of shit pharma we have here. Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks. You don‚Äôt have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear. No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential? Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities ‚Äì hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men‚Äôs lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself. Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant‚Äôs drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued. MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down - whatever could they do with that cash? $44 a share wouldn‚Äôt even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down. With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in ‚Äì remember this isn‚Äôt some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them. And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can‚Äôt see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone. FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they‚Äôve already approved in new indications like this one. Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point. It‚Äôs down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason. FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density ‚Äì the solution: they will monitor bone density. That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer. Even if they don‚Äôt Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs. Truly can‚Äôt fucking lose. so why is it trading so cheap? Well cause no one knows about it, and the upside is only written down in Japanese.",nhssad,Guaranteed Buyout and Doubling of Funds if grab Myovant (MYOV)

These patents could also be counter-espionage missions to throw foreign countries off true technological breakthroughs, but we do know there was a demo of the tech: [Navy acknowledging demo, but not production ready](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/37134/emails-show-navys-ufo-patents-went-through-significant-internal-review-resulted-in-a-demo)

Okay great, so what‚Äôs the play‚Ä¶

**Long-Raytheon ($RTX)** has the Advanced Targeting Forward Look Infrared Sensor, which can be utilized to track UAP‚Äôs. This technology has been out for over a decade. Additionally, Raytheon is the go-to company for research into lasers, targeted radiation, or proton beams (still no word on proton torpedoes). ([UFO Targeting Pod](https://sofrep.com/news/following-pentagon-admission-raytheon-touts-gear-ufo-spotter/))

**Long-Lockheed Martin ($LMT)** a major defense aerospace firm, which developed many prototypes over the years and is famous for the Skunkworks R&D lab. Former Senator Harry Reid believes Lockheed has UAP fragments in their possession ([UAP Fragments](https://deadline.com/2021/04/ufo-fragments-in-possession-lockheed-martin-says-harry-reid-1234748095/)). These fragments are believed to be made of an unknown metal/alloy, and potentially 3D printed at an atomic level.

**Long-Northrup Grumman ($NOC)** is a defense giant which developed the B-2 stealth bomber and is a contractor on multiple space infrastructure missions. They would be vital for advanced composites/metallurgy, advanced avionics, spaceflight, and tracking systems.

Additionally, we have no clear knowledge of where the Chinese and Russians are at with this technology. Maybe this is partly why we founded Space Force? This is a \~2 month play to see if we can get more decisive acknowledgement of the technology whether it is manned or alien, either way it could make for an interesting news summer.",nht2ep,The Alien Trade

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes ‚Äì well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you‚Äôll double your money.  This isn‚Äôt some wishy washy bullshit oh it‚Äôs going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it‚Äôs just a question of when.  How can I be so sure?  They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.  

Should you trust me?  Am I financial advisor ‚Äì good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips.  Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago?  We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can‚Äôt lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist?  What the fuck does that mean ‚Äì fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill.  Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.  

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn‚Äôt just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine ‚Äì kind of a big deal.  They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year.  Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe ‚Äì think FDA is going to delay? 

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no.  They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted.  Added bonus ‚Äì Pfizer‚Äôs big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also ‚Äì or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain‚Äôt going cheap.  They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner.  Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn‚Äôt allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth.  The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes ‚Äì former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius ‚Äì not piece of shit pharma we have here.  Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks.  You don‚Äôt have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear.  No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential?  Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities ‚Äì hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men‚Äôs lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself.  Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant‚Äôs drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued.  MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down  - whatever could they do with that cash?  $44 a share wouldn‚Äôt even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down.  With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in ‚Äì remember this isn‚Äôt some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them.  And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can‚Äôt see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone.  FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they‚Äôve already approved in new indications like this one.  Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point.  It‚Äôs down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason.  FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density ‚Äì the solution:  they will monitor bone density.  That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer.  Even if they don‚Äôt Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs.  Truly can‚Äôt fucking lose.  so why is it trading so cheap? Well cause no one knows about it, and the upside is only written down in Japanese.",nhtad9,Guaranteed Buyout and Doubling of Funds if buy Myovant (MYOV)

I interpret this as a strong sign of a heavy and abusive short attack.

Can't believe I'm gonna throw shade on a firm I used to love but they have REALLY gone down hill.  Don't feel like writing a wall of text but want to warn others who are thinking of switching into them so I'm just going to bullet point problems I've had.  If you are with them already and feel so-so about them... there are better options out there.  Moving money is a pain in the ass but it might be worth it.

**Issues I've had with them**

* Margin approval is like pulling teeth.  They want to grill you to death for like half an hour and slowly increase your options approval one step at a time (honestly some of those guys seem like idiots and I'm not sure how they got their certifications).  If they don't like exactly how you answer questions even as an experienced trader that's been doing it for a while, they will delay your application by up to 6 months before you can try again.  That hasn't happened to me fortunately but apparently they do that so I'm always very anxious talking to them.  I have $600k ish with them in all my accounts and my risk per trade is typically capped at $50-60k.  I tend to have extra cash if I need to average down or add something to hedge my position.  Never used margin even though I have it since it's required to do a lot of different trades.

* Frequent outages (especially at market open), error messages, slow to load in the browser portal.  Desktop platform ""StreetSmart"" is terrible IMO but I suppose that is a matter of taste.  They're portal option trading is otherwise aright, I've seen better and worse but nothing to write home about.

* $1k recently mysteriously disappeared in my account.  They were quick to correct it and apparently it's some ""very rare"" programming error but who the fuck knows for sure.  I'm sure a lot of retards out there don't even notice if money is ever missing.

* Finally, something that has always bothered me is that their execution doesn't seem that good.  With options especially +/- a couple pennies or (or nickel for larger contracts) can actually make a huge difference on your P&L for a trade.  They are THE LEADER in PFOF revenue.  Fuck them.


When I joined them close to 20 years ago, I worshiped Charles Schwab.  You can google him but he was Good Guy broker when no one cared about retail back in the day.

The company can do whatever they want behind those front doors, but if the trend is moving away from movie theaters and towards streaming, there's not a whole lot any movie theater CEO can do. 30-40 years ago, phone companies made their money on phone land lines. Technology shifted this towards internet and cellular, and the phone companies became broadband internet and cellular companies in response. Technology threatens the movie theater experience in much the same way. A monumental blow was the decision to offer box office new releases direct to streaming on day 1. There's talk of pulling back on that post-pandemic, but the threat remains.

I'm only one person, so you may view this as anecdotal, but seriously look up the trend away from theaters and towards streaming, it began in 2018-2019, long before the pandemic. I personally have gone to movie theaters less and less over the last 20 years, from 1-2 visits per month in the 2000's to 3-4 per year in 2010-2015, to 0-1 per year 2015-2020. It also doesn't mean I just never go out, I just don't consider a movie a ""going out"" activity anymore, it's been replaced by zoos, snowboarding, go-karts, golf driving range (Top Golf is fun as hell for non-golf-types), carnivals, apple orchards, hiking, outdoor concerts, beach volleyball... etc etc etc. Movies are: get some popcorn going, rent a new release to play on my 65"" tv with surround sound in the basement. My next home will have a dedicated theater in the basement with an 85""+ sized screen and even better sound.

Again, let me reiterate, while that's a lot of personal preference, I am part of the statistics that clearly show a trend away from movie theaters over the last 3-4 years.",,

No disrespect, but from what you wrote, you don't have a grasp of dynamics or the components involved. But that's okay. These auto manufacturers employ teams of engineers that spent years studying this stuff. Did you know you have to take Calc I, Calc II, Calc III, and Differential Equations just to take a precursory Dynamics class? Some engineers will then go on to specialize their entire careers on these suspension components. 

As a side note, the lack of performance from the Endurance at Baja had nothing to do with suspension or ride quality from sprung/unsprung mass. LMC simply grossly underestimated the energy required to traverse sand. One can perform the same experiment by taking a walk at the beach. Is it easier to walk the firm sand near the water or far off in the sunbaked dry sand?

The second case is when the price drops. Let‚Äôs say it drops to $90 a share. You‚Äôve lost $10000 (but you got $100 premium so your net loss is $9900).

You can't even comprehend the basics explanation and various examples I gave you. You can't even understand the various papers that explain why it is an index of fear and why it was given that name. Do you think people pulled that name out of their ass just for the fun of it? How dumb are you seriously?

You've got every professionals and experts in the area agreeing that it is an index of fear, hence why it's commonly called between professionals the index of fear, and then there's you.

How high could it go? Well If we take a look at the graph below, we can see that SPCE peaked at around 60 bucks  back in February in ANTICIPATION for the previous test flight which was delayed until May for safety reasons (They had some problems with electromagnetic interference which is fixed now). 

https://preview.redd.it/7gkt6q2b0b071.png?width=709&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf751660b6ec987adb3614000e9d1d19f4dd6b7b

So if the test flight actually happens on the 22nd, then could be really big boom. Currently the price is around 18-19 bucks, so it's an absolute steal in my opinion, but there is always the risk that some shit fucks up and the test flight is delayed even further, in which case I will have to sell the house.

And before any of you autistic fucks say that SpaceX is better, just keep in mind that Virgin Galactic is playing a whole different game. SpaceX is trying to go to Mars, and Virgin Galactic is just trying to do some space tourism. Also keep in mind that Virgin Galactic was founded 2 whole years after SpaceX, so SpaceX has had a bit of a head start.

In this post I'm going to not talk about some kind of currency that can get this post removed. Hint: it crashed big time yesterday. You know the one.

There is a new kind of this currency that uses a lot of computer storage space. How much? Well - 7 EXABYTES and it's currently adding 1 exabyte every 3 days. I'm going to assume you know about this currency and if not you can look through my post history and see which subreddit I've posted to recently involving this particular one.

#Topics of discussion:

* Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks

* WDC Fundamentals

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community.

A little bit about myself for context:

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/555339dhob071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42585b1cfe4cf1c85eab62b0cc01791f5321f1e2

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",nh8f2j,PUBM DD #1

I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let‚Äôs go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don‚Äôt need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there‚Äôs a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

UWMC has had a better post-earnings period not because their top line YOY growth was so good or even indicative of something remotely possible to sustain moving forward, but really just because of the dividend and chest pounding against RKT.

I have a position in both, and before either camp starts screaming about how one is more revolutionary, or has better blah blah blah, realize that the only thing driving price action for either is public sentiment. UWMC declared a regular dividend while RKT only a special.

It might be to their advantage to do so because they are able to profit off of the availability of COMEX -- but at what price?  
In other words, saving COMEX yet again may be becoming just too *expensive* for JPM's bean counters/risk managers.  
Or maybe they simply don't have the available unencumbered silver to do this with any longer.  
JPM and their billion ounce mountain of silver may be a paper tiger.

Lets dign in !

**Comex silver warehouse .... another 1,000,000 oz is OUT OF THE VAULT, 43,000,000 oz is gone since the silverbacks arrived. This time it is all HSBC bank. And what did big powerful JP Morgan do? Nothing!! Maybe all their silver eligible is spoken for.** 

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418.
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

Inflation is gonna destroy non-asset holders. I‚Äôm a bit worried about discount retail (5 below, DG, Dollar Tree) holding up because the business models are predicated on selling commodities at a certain price point. If commodity prices skyrocket dollar tree especially is gonna have a tough time adjusting since literally everything in their store is a dollar. So I think the better bet is to buy the actual companies that create goods that the poor are capable of buying (since inflation will eradicate much of the middle class.) Vizio products would never be sold in one of these stores but they sell really cheap TVs with internet accessibility. They sell a really good product considering the price point.

**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    
**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford‚Äôs finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford‚Äôs automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford‚Äôs $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford‚Äôs $160 billion debt load.

From old post:

1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

5132,,2021-05-21 09:36:45,t3_nhoi3w,,wallstreetbets,"Virgin Galactic announced they have a test flight scheduled for tomorrow and the stock moved up by 14% yesterday. I‚Äôm overall bearish on this company, as founder Richard Branson and SPAC-backer Chamath Palihapitiya have both sold basically all of their shares. Cathie Woods doesn‚Äôt even own it for ARK. 

I want to buy puts in anticipation of a drop Monday, this seems like the most likely outcome to me. Whether the launch is a failure or people just sell the news after a big move, it seems unlikely that it continues to rally Monday. There‚Äôs a lot of bag holders who bought at $40-60 a couple months ago that would love to get out if it bounces which would theoretically limit its possible gains Monday. On the chance the test flight greatly exceeds expectations or there is another announcement included along side the test, the stock could fly however. I feel that this is a slim but non-zero possibility. Basically whichever way it moves, it‚Äôs going to move hard. June 4th options have an IV of 165% per thinkorswim. 

My question is whether I am better off buying straight puts on $SPCE or if I should buy some sort of call/put spread to hedge my downside in the event the stock continues to fly Monday. My main concern is making the right move and still getting IV crushed. I‚Äôm looking at 6/4/21 $20 puts, or a spread at the same strike and expiry. In your opinions, is that a smart move or is there something else I should be considering? I‚Äôm still relatively new to trading options. 

Thanks for your input!

5136,,2021-05-21 11:44:07,t3_nhqhhk,,wallstreetbets,"Explosive fires have started everywhere already. Stock markets are on fire and so are property markets, as well as bond and debt markets. The problem is that fires are initially explosive but always end up implosive. 

How predictable events are (and people). This is particularly true in the world economy. Empires come and go, economies boom and bust and new currencies come and without fail always go. All this happens with regularity. 

&#x200B;

 Everything really on fire :

 We have seen  about inflation running wild and it is not just happening in stocks. Property markets are literarily exploding, especially the high end. We see this all over the world and not just in the US. In the UK for example, HSBC stated that March saw the highest number of mortgages EVER issued. In Sweden properties sell for up to 40% above asking price in a frenzied bidding war and second hand leisure boats are in such demand that they cost virtually the same as a new boat. And if you want a new boat, there is none available until 2022. It also seems that people are desperate for company after the lockdowns as prices for puppies in the UK are up to 100% higher than last year.

 Yes, everything is really on fire as people are desperate to just spend, spend, spend after a year of lockdowns and restrictions. 

 AN ECONOMIC BUBBLE OF AIR

 Since air is free, governments can produce unlimited amounts of it. And without exception, gullible people want to believe that it is actually real money and not just empty air. The beauty for the government is that they can just produce and borrow trillions of dollars at ZERO cost. And by manipulating interest rates they can borrow this money also at virtually ZERO cost. 

 So first the government manufactures the money at no cost and then they pay NOTHING for the privilege of borrowing that money. 

 The money obviously creates massive bubbles in stocks, bonds, houses, used cars , boats, puppies and other massively overvalued investments and consumer items. 

 Just look at how, for example, the Dow has gone up **exponentially and parabolically** **in the last year in an historically unprecedented straight line.** 

&#x200B;

**US Federal Debt up 74X**  
**Total US debt up ‚Äúonly‚Äù 49X**  
**M2 Money Supply up 29X>**

**Debt to GDP 1971: 37% ‚Äì 2021: 127%**

 Bubbles are called bubbles because they consist of air. And when bubbles become too big, they ALWAYS and without fail burst and implode. 

 Technically markets are giving very clear signals that THE END IS NIGH.

Whether that means days weeks or a few months, is totally irrelevant. We know that we are at the end of the most remarkable period in history in regards to money, investments and the economy.

 GOLD, SILVER AND WEALTH PRESERVATION

Gold  and Silver  have not at all reflected the massive creation of money in the last 50 years. That catchup phase is likely to start very soon based on both fundamentals and technicals. 

As regards securing your finances in periods of crisis, gold and silver have always been critical to hold.

 Everyone can afford some gold or silver. An ounce of silver is $28 and one gramme of gold is $50. So saving in precious metals will not only be very useful but essential at whatever level you can afford.

 The upside potential for gold and silver is multiples of the current prices and that is at today‚Äôs price levels. Higher inflation could take the metals to unfathomable heights.

5138,,2021-05-21 12:45:14,t3_nhrmu8,,wallstreetbets,"FuboTV posted its Q1 results on the 11th. Seasonality in sports is obviously huge, with Q1 and Q2 being the worst periods of the season.

Consequently, there was always a sequential decline in the number of subscribers in Q1 and Q2 in 2019 and 2020. Typically between -8 and -9% sequentially. Given the amazing performance that was achieved in Q3 and Q4 last year, it was heavily expected that this Q1 would again see a decline in paid subscribers.

And then the results were published. For the first time in its history, Fubo delivered a sequential growth in paid subscribers and revenue in a Q1! The inflection point as been passed, the business momentum is stronger than the seasonality of sports. Looking ahead, with the Olympics, the soccer world cup qualifiers, the main leagues restarting everywhere, I expect massive growth in paid subscribers.

Now, onto the revenue side. The ARPU is approximately constant at around 69$/month since Q3 2020. The low seasonality of Q1 means that the relative share of ARPU due to the advertising is quite low compared to Q3 and Q4 last year. Which means that a great improvement of the subscription ARPU has been reached in Q1!

Now, when we'll go into Q3 and then Q4, with the absurd growth in number of subscribers and the massive gains from advertising, I'm expecting the ARPU to again grow. Expected advertising growth is 100% YOY.

And what happens when you combine massive subscribers and ARPU growth? You have massive results.

The cherries on the cake are:

1. Fubo betting which comes as a free version in Q3 and then paid version in Q4. It can be massive as Fubo will be the only player in the industry to control end to end the viewer/bettor experience.
2. International expansion, in Europe first probably, starting in 2022.
3. Accepting wagering in unconventional currencies.

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes ‚Äì well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you‚Äôll double your money. This isn‚Äôt some wishy washy bullshit oh it‚Äôs going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it‚Äôs just a question of when. How can I be so sure? They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.

Should you trust me? Am I financial advisor ‚Äì good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips. Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago? We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can‚Äôt lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist? What the fuck does that mean ‚Äì fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill. Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn‚Äôt just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine ‚Äì kind of a big deal. They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year. Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe ‚Äì think FDA is going to delay?

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no. They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted. Added bonus ‚Äì Pfizer‚Äôs big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also ‚Äì or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain‚Äôt going cheap. They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner. Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn‚Äôt allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth. The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes ‚Äì former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius ‚Äì not piece of shit pharma we have here. Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks. You don‚Äôt have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear. No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential? Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities ‚Äì hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men‚Äôs lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself. Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant‚Äôs drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued. MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down - whatever could they do with that cash? $44 a share wouldn‚Äôt even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down. With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in ‚Äì remember this isn‚Äôt some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them. And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can‚Äôt see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone. FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they‚Äôve already approved in new indications like this one. Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point. It‚Äôs down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason. FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density ‚Äì the solution: they will monitor bone density. That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer. Even if they don‚Äôt Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs. Truly can‚Äôt fucking lose. so why is it trading so cheap? Well cause no one knows about it, and the upside is only written down in Japanese.",nhssad,Guaranteed Buyout and Doubling of Funds if grab Myovant (MYOV)

Okay great, so what‚Äôs the play‚Ä¶

**Long-Raytheon ($RTX)** has the Advanced Targeting Forward Look Infrared Sensor, which can be utilized to track UAP‚Äôs. This technology has been out for over a decade. Additionally, Raytheon is the go-to company for research into lasers, targeted radiation, or proton beams (still no word on proton torpedoes). ([UFO Targeting Pod](https://sofrep.com/news/following-pentagon-admission-raytheon-touts-gear-ufo-spotter/))

**Long-Lockheed Martin ($LMT)** a major defense aerospace firm, which developed many prototypes over the years and is famous for the Skunkworks R&D lab. Former Senator Harry Reid believes Lockheed has UAP fragments in their possession ([UAP Fragments](https://deadline.com/2021/04/ufo-fragments-in-possession-lockheed-martin-says-harry-reid-1234748095/)). These fragments are believed to be made of an unknown metal/alloy, and potentially 3D printed at an atomic level.

**Long-Northrup Grumman ($NOC)** is a defense giant which developed the B-2 stealth bomber and is a contractor on multiple space infrastructure missions. They would be vital for advanced composites/metallurgy, advanced avionics, spaceflight, and tracking systems.

Additionally, we have no clear knowledge of where the Chinese and Russians are at with this technology. Maybe this is partly why we founded Space Force? This is a \~2 month play to see if we can get more decisive acknowledgement of the technology whether it is manned or alien, either way it could make for an interesting news summer.",nht2ep,The Alien Trade

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes ‚Äì well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you‚Äôll double your money.  This isn‚Äôt some wishy washy bullshit oh it‚Äôs going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it‚Äôs just a question of when.  How can I be so sure?  They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.  

Should you trust me?  Am I financial advisor ‚Äì good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips.  Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago?  We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can‚Äôt lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist?  What the fuck does that mean ‚Äì fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill.  Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.  

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn‚Äôt just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine ‚Äì kind of a big deal.  They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year.  Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe ‚Äì think FDA is going to delay? 

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no.  They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted.  Added bonus ‚Äì Pfizer‚Äôs big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also ‚Äì or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain‚Äôt going cheap.  They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner.  Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn‚Äôt allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth.  The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes ‚Äì former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius ‚Äì not piece of shit pharma we have here.  Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks.  You don‚Äôt have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear.  No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential?  Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities ‚Äì hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men‚Äôs lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself.  Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant‚Äôs drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued.  MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down  - whatever could they do with that cash?  $44 a share wouldn‚Äôt even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down.  With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in ‚Äì remember this isn‚Äôt some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them.  And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can‚Äôt see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone.  FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they‚Äôve already approved in new indications like this one.  Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point.  It‚Äôs down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason.  FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density ‚Äì the solution:  they will monitor bone density.  That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer.  Even if they don‚Äôt Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs.  Truly can‚Äôt fucking lose.  so why is it trading so cheap? Well cause no one knows about it, and the upside is only written down in Japanese.",nhtad9,Guaranteed Buyout and Doubling of Funds if buy Myovant (MYOV)

I interpret this as a strong sign of a heavy and abusive short attack.

Previously, the only stock that made to the list for this long is GME. GME was on this list for 12 straight business days (1/19/2021 - 2/3/2021.)

Can't believe I'm gonna throw shade on a firm I used to love but they have REALLY gone down hill.  Don't feel like writing a wall of text but want to warn others who are thinking of switching into them so I'm just going to bullet point problems I've had.  If you are with them already and feel so-so about them... there are better options out there.  Moving money is a pain in the ass but it might be worth it.

**Issues I've had with them**

* Margin approval is like pulling teeth.  They want to grill you to death for like half an hour and slowly increase your options approval one step at a time (honestly some of those guys seem like idiots and I'm not sure how they got their certifications).  If they don't like exactly how you answer questions even as an experienced trader that's been doing it for a while, they will delay your application by up to 6 months before you can try again.  That hasn't happened to me fortunately but apparently they do that so I'm always very anxious talking to them.  I have $600k ish with them in all my accounts and my risk per trade is typically capped at $50-60k.  I tend to have extra cash if I need to average down or add something to hedge my position.  Never used margin even though I have it since it's required to do a lot of different trades.

* Frequent outages (especially at market open), error messages, slow to load in the browser portal.  Desktop platform ""StreetSmart"" is terrible IMO but I suppose that is a matter of taste.  They're portal option trading is otherwise aright, I've seen better and worse but nothing to write home about.

* $1k recently mysteriously disappeared in my account.  They were quick to correct it and apparently it's some ""very rare"" programming error but who the fuck knows for sure.  I'm sure a lot of retards out there don't even notice if money is ever missing.

* Finally, something that has always bothered me is that their execution doesn't seem that good.  With options especially +/- a couple pennies or (or nickel for larger contracts) can actually make a huge difference on your P&L for a trade.  They are THE LEADER in PFOF revenue.  Fuck them.


When I joined them close to 20 years ago, I worshiped Charles Schwab.  You can google him but he was Good Guy broker when no one cared about retail back in the day.  Basically the OG pioneered the discount brokerage business.  You should read about his life, such a cool mfer.  Anyways, the firm it is today is totally different and basically a scummy imposter just using the name, if you're thinking about joining.  DON'T.

Oh and btw you're the one that resorted to personnal attacks. Do you finally start to see the psychological pattern that I was talking about before? The blatant cognitive dissonance going on in your head since yesterday?

Oh and I noticed you also conveniently dismissed to explain what volatility is. You see, that's because you've got no idea. You can't explain anything. You're ignorant as fuck. And you're a lost cause in the progress of educating humanity. 

You can't even comprehend the basics explanation and various examples I gave you. You can't even understand the various papers that explain why it is an index of fear and why it was given that name. Do you think people pulled that name out of their ass just for the fun of it? How dumb are you seriously?

You've got every professionals and experts in the area agreeing that it is an index of fear, hence why it's commonly called between professionals the index of fear, and then there's you. The unknowledgeable idiot. But Bob obviously knows more than all of those that studied in the subject (me), those that are expert in the subject and those that work in the subject.

You rebought $1000 worth of that stock at $8 each
Your $100 loss is added to the cost of your repurchase, so in the IRS eyes you paid $1100 for that $1000 worth of stock

Once you sell again (and wait 30 days), your loss/gain amount is exactly what it would have been if no wash sale occurred.

In this post I'm going to not talk about some kind of currency that can get this post removed. Hint: it crashed big time yesterday. You know the one.

There is a new kind of this currency that uses a lot of computer storage space. How much? Well - 7 EXABYTES and it's currently adding 1 exabyte every 3 days. I'm going to assume you know about this currency and if not you can look through my post history and see which subreddit I've posted to recently involving this particular one.

#Topics of discussion:

* Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks

* WDC Fundamentals

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

I believe the technology will allow for a more personal approach in the field of medicine, and should not be viewed solely as a research-based company.  

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community.

A little bit about myself for context:

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/555339dhob071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42585b1cfe4cf1c85eab62b0cc01791f5321f1e2

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",nh8f2j,PUBM DD #1

6515,,2021-05-20 19:09:28,t3_nh8q8x,,wallstreetbets," So this is the first time I've ever played around with options and I'm probably doing it in a dumb way but get that's more fun for you guys to watch. I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let‚Äôs go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don‚Äôt need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there‚Äôs a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

I have a position in both, and before either camp starts screaming about how one is more revolutionary, or has better blah blah blah, realize that the only thing driving price action for either is public sentiment. UWMC declared a regular dividend while RKT only a special.

It might be to their advantage to do so because they are able to profit off of the availability of COMEX -- but at what price?  
In other words, saving COMEX yet again may be becoming just too *expensive* for JPM's bean counters/risk managers.  
Or maybe they simply don't have the available unencumbered silver to do this with any longer.  
JPM and their billion ounce mountain of silver may be a paper tiger.

**Comex silver warehouse .... another 1,000,000 oz is OUT OF THE VAULT, 43,000,000 oz is gone since the silverbacks arrived. This time it is all HSBC bank. And what did big powerful JP Morgan do? Nothing!! Maybe all their silver eligible is spoken for.** 

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418.
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

Now in 11-12 I was a security guard for a company that made coins for the us mint/ tiff jewelry.  Gold was crazy 16-1700$ an once.  It‚Äôs gone up 150-200$ an oz in the decade where we printed more money than we have since our founding. 

What if the government knew they were fucked and told hedge funds to naked short everything till oblivion. 


Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there‚Äôs at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don‚Äôt have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.  

Apes look up academic papers from the 08 collapse and what‚Äôs going on now naked shorting is on the rise.  

It‚Äôs nuts

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

Inflation is gonna destroy non-asset holders. I‚Äôm a bit worried about discount retail (5 below, DG, Dollar Tree) holding up because the business models are predicated on selling commodities at a certain price point. If commodity prices skyrocket dollar tree especially is gonna have a tough time adjusting since literally everything in their store is a dollar. So I think the better bet is to buy the actual companies that create goods that the poor are capable of buying (since inflation will eradicate much of the middle class.) Vizio products would never be sold in one of these stores but they sell really cheap TVs with internet accessibility. They sell a really good product considering the price point.

6556,,2021-05-21 07:40:32,t3_nhmv7n,,wallstreetbets,"Ford is great value investment considering it will compete with TESLA for EV market - Most of bear case is ford debt and they are 100% wrong. Please read below article.

**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    
**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford‚Äôs finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford‚Äôs automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford‚Äôs $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford‚Äôs $160 billion debt load.

From old post:

1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

I‚Äôm overall bearish on this company, as founder Richard Branson and SPAC-backer Chamath Palihapitiya have both sold basically all of their shares. Cathie Woods doesn‚Äôt even own it for ARK. 

I want to buy puts in anticipation of a drop Monday, this seems like the most likely outcome to me. Whether the launch is a failure or people just sell the news after a big move, it seems unlikely that it continues to rally Monday. There‚Äôs a lot of bag holders who bought at $40-60 a couple months ago that would love to get out if it bounces which would theoretically limit its possible gains Monday. On the chance the test flight greatly exceeds expectations or there is another announcement included along side the test, the stock could fly however. I feel that this is a slim but non-zero possibility. Basically whichever way it moves, it‚Äôs going to move hard. June 4th options have an IV of 165% per thinkorswim. 

My question is whether I am better off buying straight puts on $SPCE or if I should buy some sort of call/put spread to hedge my downside in the event the stock continues to fly Monday. My main concern is making the right move and still getting IV crushed. I‚Äôm looking at 6/4/21 $20 puts, or a spread at the same strike and expiry. In your opinions, is that a smart move or is there something else I should be considering? I‚Äôm still relatively new to trading options.

6562,,2021-05-21 11:44:07,t3_nhqhhk,,wallstreetbets,"Explosive fires have started everywhere already. Stock markets are on fire and so are property markets, as well as bond and debt markets. The problem is that fires are initially explosive but always end up implosive. 

How predictable events are (and people). This is particularly true in the world economy. Empires come and go, economies boom and bust and new currencies come and without fail always go. All this happens with regularity. 

&#x200B;

 Everything really on fire :

 We have seen  about inflation running wild and it is not just happening in stocks. Property markets are literarily exploding, especially the high end. We see this all over the world and not just in the US. In the UK for example, HSBC stated that March saw the highest number of mortgages EVER issued. In Sweden properties sell for up to 40% above asking price in a frenzied bidding war and second hand leisure boats are in such demand that they cost virtually the same as a new boat. And if you want a new boat, there is none available until 2022. It also seems that people are desperate for company after the lockdowns as prices for puppies in the UK are up to 100% higher than last year.

 Yes, everything is really on fire as people are desperate to just spend, spend, spend after a year of lockdowns and restrictions. 

 AN ECONOMIC BUBBLE OF AIR

 Since air is free, governments can produce unlimited amounts of it. And without exception, gullible people want to believe that it is actually real money and not just empty air. The beauty for the government is that they can just produce and borrow trillions of dollars at ZERO cost. And by manipulating interest rates they can borrow this money also at virtually ZERO cost. 

 So first the government manufactures the money at no cost and then they pay NOTHING for the privilege of borrowing that money. 

 The money obviously creates massive bubbles in stocks, bonds, houses, used cars , boats, puppies and other massively overvalued investments and consumer items. 

 Just look at how, for example, the Dow has gone up **exponentially and parabolically** **in the last year in an historically unprecedented straight line.** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lnjdj8xvlg071.png?width=461&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a5b514632f262f311d158e14416251b98f6d00e

 

**US Federal Debt up 74X**  
**Total US debt up ‚Äúonly‚Äù 49X**  
**M2 Money Supply up 29X>**

**Debt to GDP 1971: 37% ‚Äì 2021: 127%**

 Bubbles are called bubbles because they consist of air. And when bubbles become too big, they ALWAYS and without fail burst and implode. 

 Technically markets are giving very clear signals that THE END IS NIGH.

Whether that means days weeks or a few months, is totally irrelevant. We know that we are at the end of the most remarkable period in history in regards to money, investments and the economy.

 GOLD, SILVER AND WEALTH PRESERVATION

Gold  and Silver  have not at all reflected the massive creation of money in the last 50 years. That catchup phase is likely to start very soon based on both fundamentals and technicals. 

As regards securing your finances in periods of crisis, gold and silver have always been critical to hold.

 Everyone can afford some gold or silver. An ounce of silver is $28 and one gramme of gold is $50. So saving in precious metals will not only be very useful but essential at whatever level you can afford.

 The upside potential for gold and silver is multiples of the current prices and that is at today‚Äôs price levels. Higher inflation could take the metals to unfathomable heights.

6564,,2021-05-21 12:45:14,t3_nhrmu8,,wallstreetbets,"FuboTV posted its Q1 results on the 11th. Seasonality in sports is obviously huge, with Q1 and Q2 being the worst periods of the season.

Consequently, there was always a sequential decline in the number of subscribers in Q1 and Q2 in 2019 and 2020. Typically between -8 and -9% sequentially. Given the amazing performance that was achieved in Q3 and Q4 last year, it was heavily expected that this Q1 would again see a decline in paid subscribers.

And then the results were published. For the first time in its history, Fubo delivered a sequential growth in paid subscribers and revenue in a Q1! The inflection point as been passed, the business momentum is stronger than the seasonality of sports. Looking ahead, with the Olympics, the soccer world cup qualifiers, the main leagues restarting everywhere, I expect massive growth in paid subscribers.

Now, onto the revenue side. The ARPU is approximately constant at around 69$/month since Q3 2020. The low seasonality of Q1 means that the relative share of ARPU due to the advertising is quite low compared to Q3 and Q4 last year. Which means that a great improvement of the subscription ARPU has been reached in Q1!

Now, when we'll go into Q3 and then Q4, with the absurd growth in number of subscribers and the massive gains from advertising, I'm expecting the ARPU to again grow. Expected advertising growth is 100% YOY.

And what happens when you combine massive subscribers and ARPU growth? You have massive results.

The cherries on the cake are:

1. Fubo betting which comes as a free version in Q3 and then paid version in Q4. It can be massive as Fubo will be the only player in the industry to control end to end the viewer/bettor experience.
2. International expansion, in Europe first probably, starting in 2022.

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes ‚Äì well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you‚Äôll double your money. This isn‚Äôt some wishy washy bullshit oh it‚Äôs going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it‚Äôs just a question of when. How can I be so sure? They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.

Should you trust me? Am I financial advisor ‚Äì good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips. Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago? We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can‚Äôt lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist? What the fuck does that mean ‚Äì fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill. Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn‚Äôt just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine ‚Äì kind of a big deal. They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year. Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe ‚Äì think FDA is going to delay?

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no. They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted. Added bonus ‚Äì Pfizer‚Äôs big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also ‚Äì or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain‚Äôt going cheap. They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner. Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn‚Äôt allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth. The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes ‚Äì former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius ‚Äì not piece of shit pharma we have here. Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks. You don‚Äôt have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear. No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential? Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities ‚Äì hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men‚Äôs lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself. Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant‚Äôs drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued. MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down - whatever could they do with that cash? $44 a share wouldn‚Äôt even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down. With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in ‚Äì remember this isn‚Äôt some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them. And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can‚Äôt see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone. FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they‚Äôve already approved in new indications like this one. Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point. It‚Äôs down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason. FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density ‚Äì the solution: they will monitor bone density. That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer. Even if they don‚Äôt Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs. Truly can‚Äôt fucking lose. so why is it trading so cheap?

**Legitimate company and not a meme?** Yes. 

20 year old company with a solid balance sheet, solid earnings, profitable every quarter, and beat EPS consistently all of last year. Every damn quarter they provided positive guidance, yet the wallstreet cucks would still under-cut their expectations, only for CSIQ to crush earnings.

**Does it have a future?** Yes

They make fucking solar panels, and have been doing it for 20 years! Tesla solar roofs are meme products. When my employer wanted to add solar panels for our 3 factories, we didn't call up Tesla. We called up a EPC firm who chose Canadian Solar as the supplier.

**What are the numbers?** Yes.

Lots of cash, lots of assets, low debt, consistent income etc.

It was Congressionally mandated in the last stimulus bill and gave the government 180 days to release an unclassified report to the general public and a classified report to congress. We are approaching that time, and June/July could be a heavy shift in perspectives and R&D priorities. [Sen. Rubio's Comments](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ufo-reports-should-be-taken-seriously-rubio-says-11621245038) [WaPo Article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/03/23/ufo-report-covid-bill/)

These UAP‚Äôs exhibit unexplainable flight characteristics: near instantaneous acceleration, airplane/submersible hybrid characteristics, visual disappearance, odd acoustics, etc. Also, multiple ‚Äútypes‚Äù of craft have been observed. 

There are patents filed by the Navy for inertial mass reduction craft (basically creating a quantum vacuum around the craft to avoid air/water resistance; useful to go Mach 16+ in the atmosphere). Here‚Äôs the patent: [Triangular UAP Patent?](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10144532B2/en). Additionally, we have heard rumors (and they may just be rumors) of anti-gravity temporal displacement craft. These craft can accelerate by utilizing gravity waves, bend light through a gravity well (stealthy), and externally perceived time could be affected as well (think Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar) ([Gravity Wave Patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10322827B2/) ) This UAP sightings might be manned craft or something else, or a mixture of both. These patents could also be counter-espionage missions to throw foreign countries off true technological breakthroughs, but we do know there was a demo of the tech: [Navy acknowledging demo, but not production ready](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/37134/emails-show-navys-ufo-patents-went-through-significant-internal-review-resulted-in-a-demo)

Okay great, so what‚Äôs the play‚Ä¶

**Long-Raytheon ($RTX)** has the Advanced Targeting Forward Look Infrared Sensor, which can be utilized to track UAP‚Äôs. This technology has been out for over a decade. Additionally, Raytheon is the go-to company for research into lasers, targeted radiation, or proton beams (still no word on proton torpedoes). ([UFO Targeting Pod](https://sofrep.com/news/following-pentagon-admission-raytheon-touts-gear-ufo-spotter/))

**Long-Lockheed Martin ($LMT)** a major defense aerospace firm, which developed many prototypes over the years and is famous for the Skunkworks R&D lab. Former Senator Harry Reid believes Lockheed has UAP fragments in their possession ([UAP Fragments](https://deadline.com/2021/04/ufo-fragments-in-possession-lockheed-martin-says-harry-reid-1234748095/)). These fragments are believed to be made of an unknown metal/alloy, and potentially 3D printed at an atomic level.

**Long-Northrup Grumman ($NOC)** is a defense giant which developed the B-2 stealth bomber and is a contractor on multiple space infrastructure missions. They would be vital for advanced composites/metallurgy, advanced avionics, spaceflight, and tracking systems.

Additionally, we have no clear knowledge of where the Chinese and Russians are at with this technology. Maybe this is partly why we founded Space Force? This is a \~2 month play to see if we can get more decisive acknowledgement of the technology whether it is manned or alien, either way it could make for an interesting news summer.",nht2ep,The Alien Trade

Can't believe I'm gonna throw shade on a firm I used to love but they have REALLY gone down hill.  Don't feel like writing a wall of text but want to warn others who are thinking of switching into them so I'm just going to bullet point problems I've had.  If you are with them already and feel so-so about them... there are better options out there.  Moving money is a pain in the ass but it might be worth it.

**Issues I've had with them**

* Margin approval is like pulling teeth.  They want to grill you to death for like half an hour and slowly increase your options approval one step at a time (honestly some of those guys seem like idiots and I'm not sure how they got their certifications).  If they don't like exactly how you answer questions even as an experienced trader that's been doing it for a while, they will delay your application by up to 6 months before you can try again.  That hasn't happened to me fortunately but apparently they do that so I'm always very anxious talking to them.  I have $600k ish with them in all my accounts and my risk per trade is typically capped at $50-60k.  I tend to have extra cash if I need to average down or add something to hedge my position.  Never used margin even though I have it since it's required to do a lot of different trades.

* Frequent outages (especially at market open), error messages, slow to load in the browser portal.  Desktop platform ""StreetSmart"" is terrible IMO but I suppose that is a matter of taste.  They're portal option trading is otherwise aright, I've seen better and worse but nothing to write home about.

* $1k recently mysteriously disappeared in my account.  They were quick to correct it and apparently it's some ""very rare"" programming error but who the fuck knows for sure.  I'm sure a lot of retards out there don't even notice if money is ever missing.

* Finally, something that has always bothered me is that their execution doesn't seem that good.  With options especially +/- a couple pennies or (or nickel for larger contracts) can actually make a huge difference on your P&L for a trade.  They are THE LEADER in PFOF revenue.  Fuck them.


When I joined them close to 20 years ago, I worshiped Charles Schwab.  You can google him but he was Good Guy broker when no one cared about retail back in the day.  Basically the OG pioneered the discount brokerage business.  You should read about his life, such a cool mfer.  Anyways, the firm it is today is totally different and basically a scummy imposter just using the name, if you're thinking about joining.  DON'T.

Business has restructured and after 5G implementation from 2021-2026, Nokia will be at the head of the 6G development & implementation. They already have heavy R&D invested in 6G. They‚Äôre also considering doing a share buyback or repurchase. I personally see Nokia achieving great growth and expansion over the next half decade and decade. 

Huwawei is sinking because their heavily linked to Chinas government regime and espionage claims and with a lot of countries not favouring China and applying tariffs at the moment, I don‚Äôt believe this will be changing anytime soon for them, especially as a telecom company.

The needs of your family if so one should have one come first amongst any type of investment. If you are single and then throwing your money away make sure you have a plan for your future and what your gonna do if your current plan in life does not work out. 

Blindly throwing your money around because a group or someone told you so in hopes of being rich is a horrible way to invest or that's just my opinion. 

See the problem is the lack of actual logic people have these days, and the logic is a smart person makes sure thier bills are payed, family taken care of and life is settled before investing.

How high could it go? Well If we take a look at the graph below, we can see that SPCE peaked at around 60 bucks  back in February in ANTICIPATION for the previous test flight which was delayed until May for safety reasons (They had some problems with electromagnetic interference which is fixed now).

So if the test flight actually happens on the 22nd, then could be really big boom. Currently the price is around 18-19 bucks, so it's an absolute steal in my opinion, but there is always the risk that some shit fucks up and the test flight is delayed even further, in which case I will have to sell the house.

And before any of you autistic fucks say that SpaceX is better, just keep in mind that Virgin Galactic is playing a whole different game. SpaceX is trying to go to Mars, and Virgin Galactic is just trying to do some space tourism. Also keep in mind that Virgin Galactic was founded 2 whole years after SpaceX, so SpaceX has had a bit of a head start.

#Topics of discussion:

* Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks

* WDC Fundamentals

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

I believe the technology will allow for a more personal approach in the field of medicine, and should not be viewed solely as a research-based company.  

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community.

A little bit about myself for context:

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/555339dhob071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42585b1cfe4cf1c85eab62b0cc01791f5321f1e2

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",nh8f2j,PUBM DD #1

7169,,2021-05-20 19:09:28,t3_nh8q8x,,wallstreetbets," So this is the first time I've ever played around with options and I'm probably doing it in a dumb way but get that's more fun for you guys to watch. I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let‚Äôs go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don‚Äôt need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there‚Äôs a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

In other words, saving COMEX yet again may be becoming just too *expensive* for JPM's bean counters/risk managers.  
Or maybe they simply don't have the available unencumbered silver to do this with any longer.

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418.
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there‚Äôs at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don‚Äôt have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

Inflation is gonna destroy non-asset holders. I‚Äôm a bit worried about discount retail (5 below, DG, Dollar Tree) holding up because the business models are predicated on selling commodities at a certain price point. If commodity prices skyrocket dollar tree especially is gonna have a tough time adjusting since literally everything in their store is a dollar. So I think the better bet is to buy the actual companies that create goods that the poor are capable of buying (since inflation will eradicate much of the middle class.) Vizio products would never be sold in one of these stores but they sell really cheap TVs with internet accessibility. They sell a really good product considering the price point.

**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    
**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford‚Äôs finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford‚Äôs automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford‚Äôs $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford‚Äôs $160 billion debt load.

From old post:

1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

I‚Äôm overall bearish on this company, as founder Richard Branson and SPAC-backer Chamath Palihapitiya have both sold basically all of their shares. Cathie Woods doesn‚Äôt even own it for ARK. 

I want to buy puts in anticipation of a drop Monday, this seems like the most likely outcome to me. Whether the launch is a failure or people just sell the news after a big move, it seems unlikely that it continues to rally Monday. There‚Äôs a lot of bag holders who bought at $40-60 a couple months ago that would love to get out if it bounces which would theoretically limit its possible gains Monday. On the chance the test flight greatly exceeds expectations or there is another announcement included along side the test, the stock could fly however. I feel that this is a slim but non-zero possibility. Basically whichever way it moves, it‚Äôs going to move hard. June 4th options have an IV of 165% per thinkorswim. 

My question is whether I am better off buying straight puts on $SPCE or if I should buy some sort of call/put spread to hedge my downside in the event the stock continues to fly Monday. My main concern is making the right move and still getting IV crushed. I‚Äôm looking at 6/4/21 $20 puts, or a spread at the same strike and expiry. In your opinions, is that a smart move or is there something else I should be considering? I‚Äôm still relatively new to trading options.

7216,,2021-05-21 11:44:07,t3_nhqhhk,,wallstreetbets,"Explosive fires have started everywhere already. Stock markets are on fire and so are property markets, as well as bond and debt markets. The problem is that fires are initially explosive but always end up implosive. 

How predictable events are (and people). This is particularly true in the world economy. Empires come and go, economies boom and bust and new currencies come and without fail always go. All this happens with regularity. 

&#x200B;

 Everything really on fire :

 We have seen  about inflation running wild and it is not just happening in stocks. Property markets are literarily exploding, especially the high end. We see this all over the world and not just in the US. In the UK for example, HSBC stated that March saw the highest number of mortgages EVER issued. In Sweden properties sell for up to 40% above asking price in a frenzied bidding war and second hand leisure boats are in such demand that they cost virtually the same as a new boat. And if you want a new boat, there is none available until 2022. It also seems that people are desperate for company after the lockdowns as prices for puppies in the UK are up to 100% higher than last year.

 Yes, everything is really on fire as people are desperate to just spend, spend, spend after a year of lockdowns and restrictions. 

 AN ECONOMIC BUBBLE OF AIR

 Since air is free, governments can produce unlimited amounts of it. And without exception, gullible people want to believe that it is actually real money and not just empty air. The beauty for the government is that they can just produce and borrow trillions of dollars at ZERO cost. And by manipulating interest rates they can borrow this money also at virtually ZERO cost. 

 So first the government manufactures the money at no cost and then they pay NOTHING for the privilege of borrowing that money. 

 The money obviously creates massive bubbles in stocks, bonds, houses, used cars , boats, puppies and other massively overvalued investments and consumer items. 

 Just look at how, for example, the Dow has gone up **exponentially and parabolically** **in the last year in an historically unprecedented straight line.** 

&#x200B;

**US Federal Debt up 74X**  
**Total US debt up ‚Äúonly‚Äù 49X**  
**M2 Money Supply up 29X>**

**Debt to GDP 1971: 37% ‚Äì 2021: 127%**

 Bubbles are called bubbles because they consist of air. And when bubbles become too big, they ALWAYS and without fail burst and implode. 

 Technically markets are giving very clear signals that THE END IS NIGH.

Whether that means days weeks or a few months, is totally irrelevant. We know that we are at the end of the most remarkable period in history in regards to money, investments and the economy.

 GOLD, SILVER AND WEALTH PRESERVATION

Gold  and Silver  have not at all reflected the massive creation of money in the last 50 years. That catchup phase is likely to start very soon based on both fundamentals and technicals. 

As regards securing your finances in periods of crisis, gold and silver have always been critical to hold.

 Everyone can afford some gold or silver. An ounce of silver is $28 and one gramme of gold is $50. So saving in precious metals will not only be very useful but essential at whatever level you can afford.

 The upside potential for gold and silver is multiples of the current prices and that is at today‚Äôs price levels. Higher inflation could take the metals to unfathomable heights.

7218,,2021-05-21 12:45:14,t3_nhrmu8,,wallstreetbets,"FuboTV posted its Q1 results on the 11th. Seasonality in sports is obviously huge, with Q1 and Q2 being the worst periods of the season.

Consequently, there was always a sequential decline in the number of subscribers in Q1 and Q2 in 2019 and 2020. Typically between -8 and -9% sequentially. Given the amazing performance that was achieved in Q3 and Q4 last year, it was heavily expected that this Q1 would again see a decline in paid subscribers.

And then the results were published. For the first time in its history, Fubo delivered a sequential growth in paid subscribers and revenue in a Q1! The inflection point as been passed, the business momentum is stronger than the seasonality of sports. Looking ahead, with the Olympics, the soccer world cup qualifiers, the main leagues restarting everywhere, I expect massive growth in paid subscribers.

Now, onto the revenue side. The ARPU is approximately constant at around 69$/month since Q3 2020. The low seasonality of Q1 means that the relative share of ARPU due to the advertising is quite low compared to Q3 and Q4 last year. Which means that a great improvement of the subscription ARPU has been reached in Q1!

Now, when we'll go into Q3 and then Q4, with the absurd growth in number of subscribers and the massive gains from advertising, I'm expecting the ARPU to again grow. Expected advertising growth is 100% YOY.

And what happens when you combine massive subscribers and ARPU growth? You have massive results.

The cherries on the cake are:

1. Fubo betting which comes as a free version in Q3 and then paid version in Q4. It can be massive as Fubo will be the only player in the industry to control end to end the viewer/bettor experience.
2. International expansion, in Europe first probably, starting in 2022.

Well, October seems the answer.

From Wiki: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_largest\_daily\_changes\_in\_the\_Dow\_Jones\_Industrial\_Average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_daily_changes_in_the_Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average)

|9|4|2|

I know, in the last week many talked about a possible future crash in the stock market, inflation and there is too much liquidity and bla bla bla. I am not here to say the next crash will occur this October or on any other date (I well know that correlation is not causation). I have no subtle purpose to share, it's just for the curiosity of this pattern.

p.s. Probably the cause is because October is my birthday.

I don't know if there is something to discuss this, but I would appreciate your opinions.

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes ‚Äì well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you‚Äôll double your money. This isn‚Äôt some wishy washy bullshit oh it‚Äôs going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it‚Äôs just a question of when. How can I be so sure? They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.

Should you trust me? Am I financial advisor ‚Äì good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips. Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago? We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can‚Äôt lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist? What the fuck does that mean ‚Äì fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill. Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn‚Äôt just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine ‚Äì kind of a big deal. They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year. Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe ‚Äì think FDA is going to delay?

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no. They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted. Added bonus ‚Äì Pfizer‚Äôs big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also ‚Äì or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain‚Äôt going cheap. They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner. Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn‚Äôt allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth. The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes ‚Äì former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius ‚Äì not piece of shit pharma we have here. Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks. You don‚Äôt have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear. No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential? Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities ‚Äì hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men‚Äôs lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself. Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant‚Äôs drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued. MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down - whatever could they do with that cash? $44 a share wouldn‚Äôt even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down. With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in ‚Äì remember this isn‚Äôt some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them. And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can‚Äôt see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone. FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they‚Äôve already approved in new indications like this one. Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point. It‚Äôs down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason. FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density ‚Äì the solution: they will monitor bone density. That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer. Even if they don‚Äôt Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs. Truly can‚Äôt fucking lose. so why is it trading so cheap?

**Legitimate company and not a meme?** Yes. 

20 year old company with a solid balance sheet, solid earnings, profitable every quarter, and beat EPS consistently all of last year. Every damn quarter they provided positive guidance, yet the wallstreet cucks would still under-cut their expectations, only for CSIQ to crush earnings.

**Does it have a future?** Yes

They make fucking solar panels, and have been doing it for 20 years! Tesla solar roofs are meme products. When my employer wanted to add solar panels for our 3 factories, we didn't call up Tesla. We called up a EPC firm who chose Canadian Solar as the supplier.

It was Congressionally mandated in the last stimulus bill and gave the government 180 days to release an unclassified report to the general public and a classified report to congress. We are approaching that time, and June/July could be a heavy shift in perspectives and R&D priorities. [Sen. Rubio's Comments](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ufo-reports-should-be-taken-seriously-rubio-says-11621245038) [WaPo Article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/03/23/ufo-report-covid-bill/)

These UAP‚Äôs exhibit unexplainable flight characteristics: near instantaneous acceleration, airplane/submersible hybrid characteristics, visual disappearance, odd acoustics, etc. Also, multiple ‚Äútypes‚Äù of craft have been observed. 

There are patents filed by the Navy for inertial mass reduction craft (basically creating a quantum vacuum around the craft to avoid air/water resistance; useful to go Mach 16+ in the atmosphere). Here‚Äôs the patent: [Triangular UAP Patent?](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10144532B2/en). Additionally, we have heard rumors (and they may just be rumors) of anti-gravity temporal displacement craft. These craft can accelerate by utilizing gravity waves, bend light through a gravity well (stealthy), and externally perceived time could be affected as well (think Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar) ([Gravity Wave Patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10322827B2/) ) This UAP sightings might be manned craft or something else, or a mixture of both. These patents could also be counter-espionage missions to throw foreign countries off true technological breakthroughs, but we do know there was a demo of the tech: [Navy acknowledging demo, but not production ready](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/37134/emails-show-navys-ufo-patents-went-through-significant-internal-review-resulted-in-a-demo)

Okay great, so what‚Äôs the play‚Ä¶

**Long-Raytheon ($RTX)** has the Advanced Targeting Forward Look Infrared Sensor, which can be utilized to track UAP‚Äôs. This technology has been out for over a decade. Additionally, Raytheon is the go-to company for research into lasers, targeted radiation, or proton beams (still no word on proton torpedoes). ([UFO Targeting Pod](https://sofrep.com/news/following-pentagon-admission-raytheon-touts-gear-ufo-spotter/))

**Long-Lockheed Martin ($LMT)** a major defense aerospace firm, which developed many prototypes over the years and is famous for the Skunkworks R&D lab. Former Senator Harry Reid believes Lockheed has UAP fragments in their possession ([UAP Fragments](https://deadline.com/2021/04/ufo-fragments-in-possession-lockheed-martin-says-harry-reid-1234748095/)). These fragments are believed to be made of an unknown metal/alloy, and potentially 3D printed at an atomic level.

**Long-Northrup Grumman ($NOC)** is a defense giant which developed the B-2 stealth bomber and is a contractor on multiple space infrastructure missions. They would be vital for advanced composites/metallurgy, advanced avionics, spaceflight, and tracking systems.

Additionally, we have no clear knowledge of where the Chinese and Russians are at with this technology. Maybe this is partly why we founded Space Force? This is a \~2 month play to see if we can get more decisive acknowledgement of the technology whether it is manned or alien, either way it could make for an interesting news summer.",nht2ep,The Alien Trade

Can't believe I'm gonna throw shade on a firm I used to love but they have REALLY gone down hill.  Don't feel like writing a wall of text but want to warn others who are thinking of switching into them so I'm just going to bullet point problems I've had.  If you are with them already and feel so-so about them... there are better options out there.  Moving money is a pain in the ass but it might be worth it.

**Issues I've had with them**

* Margin approval is like pulling teeth.  They want to grill you to death for like half an hour and slowly increase your options approval one step at a time (honestly some of those guys seem like idiots and I'm not sure how they got their certifications).  If they don't like exactly how you answer questions even as an experienced trader that's been doing it for a while, they will delay your application by up to 6 months before you can try again.  That hasn't happened to me fortunately but apparently they do that so I'm always very anxious talking to them.  I have $600k ish with them in all my accounts and my risk per trade is typically capped at $50-60k.  I tend to have extra cash if I need to average down or add something to hedge my position.  Never used margin even though I have it since it's required to do a lot of different trades.

* Frequent outages (especially at market open), error messages, slow to load in the browser portal.  Desktop platform ""StreetSmart"" is terrible IMO but I suppose that is a matter of taste.  They're portal option trading is otherwise aright, I've seen better and worse but nothing to write home about.

* $1k recently mysteriously disappeared in my account.  They were quick to correct it and apparently it's some ""very rare"" programming error but who the fuck knows for sure.  I'm sure a lot of retards out there don't even notice if money is ever missing.

* Finally, something that has always bothered me is that their execution doesn't seem that good.  With options especially +/- a couple pennies or (or nickel for larger contracts) can actually make a huge difference on your P&L for a trade.  They are THE LEADER in PFOF revenue.  Fuck them.


When I joined them close to 20 years ago, I worshiped Charles Schwab.  You can google him but he was Good Guy broker when no one cared about retail back in the day.  Basically the OG pioneered the discount brokerage business.  You should read about his life, such a cool mfer.  Anyways, the firm it is today is totally different and basically a scummy imposter just using the name, if you're thinking about joining.  DON'T.

This should not be arguable - if your workers qualify for social assistance then you're a *cost* to the economy, not a benefit, and should close (or at least be on the hook for that social assistance). It's a direct cost to you as a consumer that happens every day - you are directly subsidizing these companies and their behaviour.

>The increase of wages will not help anyone as it will just trickle down   
to most corporates bottom line and you know the boards are not willing   
to take less so they'll just push it to the consumer which repeats the   
cycle.

Your point here is that companies will raise the prices, but there is still competition; the often quoted statistic is the price of a big mac in Denmark, where the wages and taxes are significantly higher (It's $4.87 in Denmark and $5.66 on average in the US, incidentally). Unless literally everywhere raises their prices at the same time, anyone who does will be at a competitive disadvantage. In reality, prices would rise a bit and settle into a new equilibrium.

The health of the economy is based around the velocity of money. Every dollar that goes to someone who will spend it is worth far more than one that's sitting in a bank account somewhere. Raising the minimum wage will do way more for the US economy than giving companies billions in tax breaks.",,

so the benefit of the electric would be ability to do the same thing on top of no gas at all. however itll prob be less sales than the mach, i think hybrid sales were about 2k. but when they realized what the hybrid could do, they began being bought up. so i think thats the biggest benefit.

#Topics of discussion:

* Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks

* WDC Fundamentals

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

\*\*\*My average in @ $5.10, currently at $5.52, May 20th, 2021

I am not investing in the company as a get-rich-quick scheme, but plan to hold long term. **Saphyr** technology will continue to improve directly with design improvements, but also indirectly with the data that it continuously collects will create more accurate correlations of DNA with individual predispositions for disease. 

I believe the technology will allow for a more personal approach in the field of medicine, and should not be viewed solely as a research-based company.  

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community. 

* **Large institutional investments have nearly tripled (3X) from 5% to 14%.** 
* **Earnings beat expectations in Q1 2021.**
* **Recent large insider procurement.**
* **New patents, research breakthroughs, Large Lab facility adoption.**

This is why I have a strong conviction for **Bionano Genomics (BNGO)** being a great growth stock to investigate and follow. 

There are some negative indicators fundamentally, but considering Bionano is still in its infancy I am very optimistic in my outlook. The positives tip the scale in my opinion and at the very least, Bianano Genomics (BNGO) should be on your watchlist!

Also, this past week AAPL has been testing it's 200 day moving average. If we continue the rally strong from this area then it will invalidate the head and shoulders pattern outlined above. If we close below that (currently @ $123.69) that would give more confirmation of this head and shoulders break to the downside.

Another point of interest is that the SlowRSI is currently @ 33.29. Typically a bottom is put in when this reaches the 20 level or below. This itself is no reason for a pullback, but everything said put together strengthens the pullback argument.

All said and done, I am bullish on AAPL but believe we need to see a deep pullback in order for it to be more attractive to the masses and drive more volume into the stock. After this potential pullback I can see AAPL rallying hard to the upside, so pay attention and be patient for a good entry.",nh6ijq,AAPL - Potential Daily Head and Shoulders pattern breaking

A little bit about myself for context:

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/555339dhob071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42585b1cfe4cf1c85eab62b0cc01791f5321f1e2

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",nh8f2j,PUBM DD #1

I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let‚Äôs go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don‚Äôt need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there‚Äôs a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

Orders are being canceled, and you even have UFC fighters calling them out [https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-elon-musk-beneil-dariush-ufc-model-3-loaner/](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-elon-musk-beneil-dariush-ufc-model-3-loaner/) 

TBH I am just pissed Dariush gets a loaner and I don't, so I have decided to go about it my own way. I have puts and I am going to buy more puts tomorrow and hold it until it makes me enough money to buy my car cash. 

Support my vision fellow apes.

W-shape with today's price action.

* For the w-shape to hold true we need to push over 418.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418.
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

However I was deep thinking, so I started digging.  We never recovered from the 08 crisis.  They just dropped interest rates and turned on the printer.  

Now in 11-12 I was a security guard for a company that made coins for the us mint/ tiff jewelry.  Gold was crazy 16-1700$ an once.  It‚Äôs gone up 150-200$ an oz in the decade where we printed more money than we have since our founding. 

What if the government knew they were fucked and told hedge funds to naked short everything till oblivion. 


Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there‚Äôs at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don‚Äôt have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.  

Apes look up academic papers from the 08 collapse and what‚Äôs going on now naked shorting is on the rise.

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

Inflation is gonna destroy non-asset holders. I‚Äôm a bit worried about discount retail (5 below, DG, Dollar Tree) holding up because the business models are predicated on selling commodities at a certain price point. If commodity prices skyrocket dollar tree especially is gonna have a tough time adjusting since literally everything in their store is a dollar. So I think the better bet is to buy the actual companies that create goods that the poor are capable of buying (since inflation will eradicate much of the middle class.) Vizio products would never be sold in one of these stores but they sell really cheap TVs with internet accessibility. They sell a really good product considering the price point. I check their books and it‚Äôs a profitable company that‚Äôs been improving margins that last two years. Pretty low market cap so I wouldn‚Äôt be shocked if a larger company sought to buy it in the future. Worth ripping OTM yolos for the next two years",nhlgkk,Vizio: A Macroeconomic perspective

**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    
**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford‚Äôs finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford‚Äôs automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford‚Äôs $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford‚Äôs $160 billion debt load.

From old post:

1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

I‚Äôm overall bearish on this company, as founder Richard Branson and SPAC-backer Chamath Palihapitiya have both sold basically all of their shares. Cathie Woods doesn‚Äôt even own it for ARK. 

I want to buy puts in anticipation of a drop Monday, this seems like the most likely outcome to me. Whether the launch is a failure or people just sell the news after a big move, it seems unlikely that it continues to rally Monday. There‚Äôs a lot of bag holders who bought at $40-60 a couple months ago that would love to get out if it bounces which would theoretically limit its possible gains Monday. On the chance the test flight greatly exceeds expectations or there is another announcement included along side the test, the stock could fly however. I feel that this is a slim but non-zero possibility. Basically whichever way it moves, it‚Äôs going to move hard. June 4th options have an IV of 165% per thinkorswim. 

My question is whether I am better off buying straight puts on $SPCE or if I should buy some sort of call/put spread to hedge my downside in the event the stock continues to fly Monday. My main concern is making the right move and still getting IV crushed. I‚Äôm looking at 6/4/21 $20 puts, or a spread at the same strike and expiry. In your opinions, is that a smart move or is there something else I should be considering? I‚Äôm still relatively new to trading options. 

Thanks for your input!

How predictable events are (and people). This is particularly true in the world economy. Empires come and go, economies boom and bust and new currencies come and without fail always go. All this happens with regularity. 

&#x200B;

 Everything really on fire :

 We have seen  about inflation running wild and it is not just happening in stocks. Property markets are literarily exploding, especially the high end. We see this all over the world and not just in the US. In the UK for example, HSBC stated that March saw the highest number of mortgages EVER issued. In Sweden properties sell for up to 40% above asking price in a frenzied bidding war and second hand leisure boats are in such demand that they cost virtually the same as a new boat. And if you want a new boat, there is none available until 2022. It also seems that people are desperate for company after the lockdowns as prices for puppies in the UK are up to 100% higher than last year.

 Yes, everything is really on fire as people are desperate to just spend, spend, spend after a year of lockdowns and restrictions. 

 AN ECONOMIC BUBBLE OF AIR

 Since air is free, governments can produce unlimited amounts of it. And without exception, gullible people want to believe that it is actually real money and not just empty air. The beauty for the government is that they can just produce and borrow trillions of dollars at ZERO cost. And by manipulating interest rates they can borrow this money also at virtually ZERO cost. 

 So first the government manufactures the money at no cost and then they pay NOTHING for the privilege of borrowing that money. 

 The money obviously creates massive bubbles in stocks, bonds, houses, used cars , boats, puppies and other massively overvalued investments and consumer items. 

 Just look at how, for example, the Dow has gone up **exponentially and parabolically** **in the last year in an historically unprecedented straight line.**

**US Federal Debt up 74X**  
**Total US debt up ‚Äúonly‚Äù 49X**  
**M2 Money Supply up 29X>**

**Debt to GDP 1971: 37% ‚Äì 2021: 127%**

 Bubbles are called bubbles because they consist of air. And when bubbles become too big, they ALWAYS and without fail burst and implode. 

 Technically markets are giving very clear signals that THE END IS NIGH.

Whether that means days weeks or a few months, is totally irrelevant. We know that we are at the end of the most remarkable period in history in regards to money, investments and the economy.

 GOLD, SILVER AND WEALTH PRESERVATION

Gold  and Silver  have not at all reflected the massive creation of money in the last 50 years. That catchup phase is likely to start very soon based on both fundamentals and technicals. 

As regards securing your finances in periods of crisis, gold and silver have always been critical to hold.

 Everyone can afford some gold or silver. An ounce of silver is $28 and one gramme of gold is $50. So saving in precious metals will not only be very useful but essential at whatever level you can afford.

 The upside potential for gold and silver is multiples of the current prices and that is at today‚Äôs price levels. Higher inflation could take the metals to unfathomable heights.

Voclosporin, the first FDA-approved oral therapy for lupus nephritis, will be sold as Lupkynis by Aurinia Pharmaceuticals and is approved for use in conjunction with immunosuppressive treatment. And a quick Google search will verify rumors of a potential buyout by larger company.

Stonk is up 15% in the last two weeks, and 50% off 52 week high
Market cap is 1.6 billion
Only 128 million shares outstanding
44% currently owned by institutions

Unlike most other stonks on WSB, This company actually becomes more profitable as it spends more money. Yes, I'm looking at you UWMC. If they continue at this rate, they will be profitable before end of year. Check their earnings.

7774,,2021-05-21 12:45:14,t3_nhrmu8,,wallstreetbets,"FuboTV posted its Q1 results on the 11th. Seasonality in sports is obviously huge, with Q1 and Q2 being the worst periods of the season.

Consequently, there was always a sequential decline in the number of subscribers in Q1 and Q2 in 2019 and 2020. Typically between -8 and -9% sequentially. Given the amazing performance that was achieved in Q3 and Q4 last year, it was heavily expected that this Q1 would again see a decline in paid subscribers.

And then the results were published. For the first time in its history, Fubo delivered a sequential growth in paid subscribers and revenue in a Q1! The inflection point as been passed, the business momentum is stronger than the seasonality of sports. Looking ahead, with the Olympics, the soccer world cup qualifiers, the main leagues restarting everywhere, I expect massive growth in paid subscribers.

Now, onto the revenue side. The ARPU is approximately constant at around 69$/month since Q3 2020. The low seasonality of Q1 means that the relative share of ARPU due to the advertising is quite low compared to Q3 and Q4 last year. Which means that a great improvement of the subscription ARPU has been reached in Q1!

Now, when we'll go into Q3 and then Q4, with the absurd growth in number of subscribers and the massive gains from advertising, I'm expecting the ARPU to again grow. Expected advertising growth is 100% YOY.

And what happens when you combine massive subscribers and ARPU growth? You have massive results.

The cherries on the cake are:

1. Fubo betting which comes as a free version in Q3 and then paid version in Q4. It can be massive as Fubo will be the only player in the industry to control end to end the viewer/bettor experience.
2. International expansion, in Europe first probably, starting in 2022.
3. Accepting wagering in unconventional currencies.

I know, in the last week many talked about a possible future crash in the stock market, inflation and there is too much liquidity and bla bla bla. I am not here to say the next crash will occur this October or on any other date (I well know that correlation is not causation). I have no subtle purpose to share, it's just for the curiosity of this pattern.

p.s. Probably the cause is because October is my birthday.

I don't know if there is something to discuss this, but I would appreciate your opinions.

This isn‚Äôt some wishy washy bullshit oh it‚Äôs going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it‚Äôs just a question of when. How can I be so sure? They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.

Should you trust me? Am I financial advisor ‚Äì good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips. Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago? We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can‚Äôt lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist? What the fuck does that mean ‚Äì fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill. Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn‚Äôt just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine ‚Äì kind of a big deal. They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year. Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe ‚Äì think FDA is going to delay?

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no. They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted. Added bonus ‚Äì Pfizer‚Äôs big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also ‚Äì or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain‚Äôt going cheap. They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner. Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn‚Äôt allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth. The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes ‚Äì former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius ‚Äì not piece of shit pharma we have here. Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks. You don‚Äôt have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear. No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential? Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities ‚Äì hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men‚Äôs lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself. Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant‚Äôs drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued. MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down - whatever could they do with that cash? $44 a share wouldn‚Äôt even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down. With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in ‚Äì remember this isn‚Äôt some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them. And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can‚Äôt see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone. FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they‚Äôve already approved in new indications like this one. Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point. It‚Äôs down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason. FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density ‚Äì the solution: they will monitor bone density. That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer.

These UAP‚Äôs exhibit unexplainable flight characteristics: near instantaneous acceleration, airplane/submersible hybrid characteristics, visual disappearance, odd acoustics, etc. Also, multiple ‚Äútypes‚Äù of craft have been observed.

Additionally, we have heard rumors (and they may just be rumors) of anti-gravity temporal displacement craft. These craft can accelerate by utilizing gravity waves, bend light through a gravity well (stealthy), and externally perceived time could be affected as well (think Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar) ([Gravity Wave Patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10322827B2/) ) This UAP sightings might be manned craft or something else, or a mixture of both. These patents could also be counter-espionage missions to throw foreign countries off true technological breakthroughs, but we do know there was a demo of the tech: [Navy acknowledging demo, but not production ready](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/37134/emails-show-navys-ufo-patents-went-through-significant-internal-review-resulted-in-a-demo)

([UFO Targeting Pod](https://sofrep.com/news/following-pentagon-admission-raytheon-touts-gear-ufo-spotter/))

**Long-Lockheed Martin ($LMT)** a major defense aerospace firm, which developed many prototypes over the years and is famous for the Skunkworks R&D lab.

These fragments are believed to be made of an unknown metal/alloy, and potentially 3D printed at an atomic level.

**Long-Northrup Grumman ($NOC)** is a defense giant which developed the B-2 stealth bomber and is a contractor on multiple space infrastructure missions. They would be vital for advanced composites/metallurgy, advanced avionics, spaceflight, and tracking systems.

If you are with them already and feel so-so about them... there are better options out there.  Moving money is a pain in the ass but it might be worth it.

**Issues I've had with them**

* Margin approval is like pulling teeth.  They want to grill you to death for like half an hour and slowly increase your options approval one step at a time (honestly some of those guys seem like idiots and I'm not sure how they got their certifications).  If they don't like exactly how you answer questions even as an experienced trader that's been doing it for a while, they will delay your application by up to 6 months before you can try again.  That hasn't happened to me fortunately but apparently they do that so I'm always very anxious talking to them.  I have $600k ish with them in all my accounts and my risk per trade is typically capped at $50-60k.  I tend to have extra cash if I need to average down or add something to hedge my position.  Never used margin even though I have it since it's required to do a lot of different trades.

* Frequent outages (especially at market open), error messages, slow to load in the browser portal.  Desktop platform ""StreetSmart"" is terrible IMO but I suppose that is a matter of taste.  They're portal option trading is otherwise aright, I've seen better and worse but nothing to write home about.

* $1k recently mysteriously disappeared in my account.  They were quick to correct it and apparently it's some ""very rare"" programming error but who the fuck knows for sure.  I'm sure a lot of retards out there don't even notice if money is ever missing.

* Finally, something that has always bothered me is that their execution doesn't seem that good.  With options especially +/- a couple pennies or (or nickel for larger contracts) can actually make a huge difference on your P&L for a trade.  They are THE LEADER in PFOF revenue.  Fuck them.


When I joined them close to 20 years ago, I worshiped Charles Schwab.  You can google him but he was Good Guy broker when no one cared about retail back in the day.  Basically the OG pioneered the discount brokerage business.  You should read about his life, such a cool mfer.  Anyways, the firm it is today is totally different and basically a scummy imposter just using the name, if you're thinking about joining.  DON'T.

The problem with stock like apple is that they were trading at around 80$ just before COVID, and now it's around 125$ and the business hasn't improved to that same degree. Rather it got overbought with all the stimulus money and easy credit and so on, like pretty much most of the tech sector. AMD similar story as well I'd say, but I'd buy after the correction is done.

Also, this past week AAPL has been testing it's 200 day moving average. If we continue the rally strong from this area then it will invalidate the head and shoulders pattern outlined above. If we close below that (currently @ $123.69) that would give more confirmation of this head and shoulders break to the downside.

Another point of interest is that the SlowRSI is currently @ 33.29. Typically a bottom is put in when this reaches the 20 level or below. This itself is no reason for a pullback, but everything said put together strengthens the pullback argument.

All said and done, I am bullish on AAPL but believe we need to see a deep pullback in order for it to be more attractive to the masses and drive more volume into the stock.

A little bit about myself for context:

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/555339dhob071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42585b1cfe4cf1c85eab62b0cc01791f5321f1e2

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",nh8f2j,PUBM DD #1

8169,,2021-05-20 19:09:28,t3_nh8q8x,,wallstreetbets," So this is the first time I've ever played around with options and I'm probably doing it in a dumb way but get that's more fun for you guys to watch. I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let‚Äôs go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don‚Äôt need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there‚Äôs a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

I have a position in both, and before either camp starts screaming about how one is more revolutionary, or has better blah blah blah, realize that the only thing driving price action for either is public sentiment. UWMC declared a regular dividend while RKT only a special.

It might be to their advantage to do so because they are able to profit off of the availability of COMEX -- but at what price?  
In other words, saving COMEX yet again may be becoming just too *expensive* for JPM's bean counters/risk managers.  
Or maybe they simply don't have the available unencumbered silver to do this with any longer.  
JPM and their billion ounce mountain of silver may be a paper tiger.

**Comex silver warehouse .... another 1,000,000 oz is OUT OF THE VAULT, 43,000,000 oz is gone since the silverbacks arrived. This time it is all HSBC bank. And what did big powerful JP Morgan do? Nothing!! Maybe all their silver eligible is spoken for.** 

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418.
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

Inflation is gonna destroy non-asset holders. I‚Äôm a bit worried about discount retail (5 below, DG, Dollar Tree) holding up because the business models are predicated on selling commodities at a certain price point. If commodity prices skyrocket dollar tree especially is gonna have a tough time adjusting since literally everything in their store is a dollar. So I think the better bet is to buy the actual companies that create goods that the poor are capable of buying (since inflation will eradicate much of the middle class.) Vizio products would never be sold in one of these stores but they sell really cheap TVs with internet accessibility. They sell a really good product considering the price point.

**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    
**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford‚Äôs finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford‚Äôs automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford‚Äôs $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford‚Äôs $160 billion debt load.

From old post:

1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

I‚Äôm overall bearish on this company, as founder Richard Branson and SPAC-backer Chamath Palihapitiya have both sold basically all of their shares. Cathie Woods doesn‚Äôt even own it for ARK. 

I want to buy puts in anticipation of a drop Monday, this seems like the most likely outcome to me. Whether the launch is a failure or people just sell the news after a big move, it seems unlikely that it continues to rally Monday. There‚Äôs a lot of bag holders who bought at $40-60 a couple months ago that would love to get out if it bounces which would theoretically limit its possible gains Monday. On the chance the test flight greatly exceeds expectations or there is another announcement included along side the test, the stock could fly however. I feel that this is a slim but non-zero possibility. Basically whichever way it moves, it‚Äôs going to move hard. June 4th options have an IV of 165% per thinkorswim. 

My question is whether I am better off buying straight puts on $SPCE or if I should buy some sort of call/put spread to hedge my downside in the event the stock continues to fly Monday. My main concern is making the right move and still getting IV crushed. I‚Äôm looking at 6/4/21 $20 puts, or a spread at the same strike and expiry. In your opinions, is that a smart move or is there something else I should be considering? I‚Äôm still relatively new to trading options.

8216,,2021-05-21 11:44:07,t3_nhqhhk,,wallstreetbets,"Explosive fires have started everywhere already. Stock markets are on fire and so are property markets, as well as bond and debt markets. The problem is that fires are initially explosive but always end up implosive. 

How predictable events are (and people). This is particularly true in the world economy. Empires come and go, economies boom and bust and new currencies come and without fail always go. All this happens with regularity. 

&#x200B;

 Everything really on fire :

 We have seen  about inflation running wild and it is not just happening in stocks. Property markets are literarily exploding, especially the high end. We see this all over the world and not just in the US. In the UK for example, HSBC stated that March saw the highest number of mortgages EVER issued. In Sweden properties sell for up to 40% above asking price in a frenzied bidding war and second hand leisure boats are in such demand that they cost virtually the same as a new boat. And if you want a new boat, there is none available until 2022. It also seems that people are desperate for company after the lockdowns as prices for puppies in the UK are up to 100% higher than last year.

 Yes, everything is really on fire as people are desperate to just spend, spend, spend after a year of lockdowns and restrictions. 

 AN ECONOMIC BUBBLE OF AIR

 Since air is free, governments can produce unlimited amounts of it. And without exception, gullible people want to believe that it is actually real money and not just empty air. The beauty for the government is that they can just produce and borrow trillions of dollars at ZERO cost. And by manipulating interest rates they can borrow this money also at virtually ZERO cost. 

 So first the government manufactures the money at no cost and then they pay NOTHING for the privilege of borrowing that money. 

 The money obviously creates massive bubbles in stocks, bonds, houses, used cars , boats, puppies and other massively overvalued investments and consumer items. 

 Just look at how, for example, the Dow has gone up **exponentially and parabolically** **in the last year in an historically unprecedented straight line.** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lnjdj8xvlg071.png?width=461&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a5b514632f262f311d158e14416251b98f6d00e

 

**US Federal Debt up 74X**  
**Total US debt up ‚Äúonly‚Äù 49X**  
**M2 Money Supply up 29X>**

**Debt to GDP 1971: 37% ‚Äì 2021: 127%**

 Bubbles are called bubbles because they consist of air. And when bubbles become too big, they ALWAYS and without fail burst and implode. 

 Technically markets are giving very clear signals that THE END IS NIGH.

Whether that means days weeks or a few months, is totally irrelevant. We know that we are at the end of the most remarkable period in history in regards to money, investments and the economy.

 GOLD, SILVER AND WEALTH PRESERVATION

Gold  and Silver  have not at all reflected the massive creation of money in the last 50 years. That catchup phase is likely to start very soon based on both fundamentals and technicals. 

As regards securing your finances in periods of crisis, gold and silver have always been critical to hold.

 Everyone can afford some gold or silver. An ounce of silver is $28 and one gramme of gold is $50. So saving in precious metals will not only be very useful but essential at whatever level you can afford.

 The upside potential for gold and silver is multiples of the current prices and that is at today‚Äôs price levels. Higher inflation could take the metals to unfathomable heights.

8218,,2021-05-21 12:45:14,t3_nhrmu8,,wallstreetbets,"FuboTV posted its Q1 results on the 11th. Seasonality in sports is obviously huge, with Q1 and Q2 being the worst periods of the season.

Consequently, there was always a sequential decline in the number of subscribers in Q1 and Q2 in 2019 and 2020. Typically between -8 and -9% sequentially. Given the amazing performance that was achieved in Q3 and Q4 last year, it was heavily expected that this Q1 would again see a decline in paid subscribers.

And then the results were published. For the first time in its history, Fubo delivered a sequential growth in paid subscribers and revenue in a Q1! The inflection point as been passed, the business momentum is stronger than the seasonality of sports. Looking ahead, with the Olympics, the soccer world cup qualifiers, the main leagues restarting everywhere, I expect massive growth in paid subscribers.

Now, onto the revenue side. The ARPU is approximately constant at around 69$/month since Q3 2020. The low seasonality of Q1 means that the relative share of ARPU due to the advertising is quite low compared to Q3 and Q4 last year. Which means that a great improvement of the subscription ARPU has been reached in Q1!

Now, when we'll go into Q3 and then Q4, with the absurd growth in number of subscribers and the massive gains from advertising, I'm expecting the ARPU to again grow. Expected advertising growth is 100% YOY.

And what happens when you combine massive subscribers and ARPU growth? You have massive results.

The cherries on the cake are:

1. Fubo betting which comes as a free version in Q3 and then paid version in Q4. It can be massive as Fubo will be the only player in the industry to control end to end the viewer/bettor experience.
2. International expansion, in Europe first probably, starting in 2022.

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn‚Äôt just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine ‚Äì kind of a big deal. They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year. Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe ‚Äì think FDA is going to delay?

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no. They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted. Added bonus ‚Äì Pfizer‚Äôs big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also ‚Äì or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain‚Äôt going cheap. They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner. Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn‚Äôt allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth. The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes ‚Äì former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius ‚Äì not piece of shit pharma we have here. Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks. You don‚Äôt have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear. No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential? Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities ‚Äì hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men‚Äôs lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself. Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant‚Äôs drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued. MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down - whatever could they do with that cash? $44 a share wouldn‚Äôt even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down. With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in ‚Äì remember this isn‚Äôt some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them. And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can‚Äôt see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone. FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they‚Äôve already approved in new indications like this one. Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point. It‚Äôs down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason. FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density ‚Äì the solution: they will monitor bone density.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer.

**Legitimate company and not a meme?** Yes. 

20 year old company with a solid balance sheet, solid earnings, profitable every quarter, and beat EPS consistently all of last year. Every damn quarter they provided positive guidance, yet the wallstreet cucks would still under-cut their expectations, only for CSIQ to crush earnings.

**Does it have a future?** Yes

They make fucking solar panels, and have been doing it for 20 years! Tesla solar roofs are meme products. When my employer wanted to add solar panels for our 3 factories, we didn't call up Tesla. We called up a EPC firm who chose Canadian Solar as the supplier.

Lots of cash, lots of assets, low debt, consistent income etc.

It was Congressionally mandated in the last stimulus bill and gave the government 180 days to release an unclassified report to the general public and a classified report to congress. We are approaching that time, and June/July could be a heavy shift in perspectives and R&D priorities. [Sen. Rubio's Comments](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ufo-reports-should-be-taken-seriously-rubio-says-11621245038) [WaPo Article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/03/23/ufo-report-covid-bill/)

These UAP‚Äôs exhibit unexplainable flight characteristics: near instantaneous acceleration, airplane/submersible hybrid characteristics, visual disappearance, odd acoustics, etc. Also, multiple ‚Äútypes‚Äù of craft have been observed. 

There are patents filed by the Navy for inertial mass reduction craft (basically creating a quantum vacuum around the craft to avoid air/water resistance; useful to go Mach 16+ in the atmosphere). Here‚Äôs the patent: [Triangular UAP Patent?](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10144532B2/en). Additionally, we have heard rumors (and they may just be rumors) of anti-gravity temporal displacement craft. These craft can accelerate by utilizing gravity waves, bend light through a gravity well (stealthy), and externally perceived time could be affected as well (think Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar) ([Gravity Wave Patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10322827B2/) ) This UAP sightings might be manned craft or something else, or a mixture of both. These patents could also be counter-espionage missions to throw foreign countries off true technological breakthroughs, but we do know there was a demo of the tech: [Navy acknowledging demo, but not production ready](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/37134/emails-show-navys-ufo-patents-went-through-significant-internal-review-resulted-in-a-demo)

Okay great, so what‚Äôs the play‚Ä¶

**Long-Raytheon ($RTX)** has the Advanced Targeting Forward Look Infrared Sensor, which can be utilized to track UAP‚Äôs. This technology has been out for over a decade. Additionally, Raytheon is the go-to company for research into lasers, targeted radiation, or proton beams (still no word on proton torpedoes). ([UFO Targeting Pod](https://sofrep.com/news/following-pentagon-admission-raytheon-touts-gear-ufo-spotter/))

**Long-Lockheed Martin ($LMT)** a major defense aerospace firm, which developed many prototypes over the years and is famous for the Skunkworks R&D lab. Former Senator Harry Reid believes Lockheed has UAP fragments in their possession ([UAP Fragments](https://deadline.com/2021/04/ufo-fragments-in-possession-lockheed-martin-says-harry-reid-1234748095/)). These fragments are believed to be made of an unknown metal/alloy, and potentially 3D printed at an atomic level.

**Long-Northrup Grumman ($NOC)** is a defense giant which developed the B-2 stealth bomber and is a contractor on multiple space infrastructure missions. They would be vital for advanced composites/metallurgy, advanced avionics, spaceflight, and tracking systems.

Additionally, we have no clear knowledge of where the Chinese and Russians are at with this technology. Maybe this is partly why we founded Space Force?

Can't believe I'm gonna throw shade on a firm I used to love but they have REALLY gone down hill.  Don't feel like writing a wall of text but want to warn others who are thinking of switching into them so I'm just going to bullet point problems I've had.  If you are with them already and feel so-so about them... there are better options out there.  Moving money is a pain in the ass but it might be worth it.

**Issues I've had with them**

* Margin approval is like pulling teeth.  They want to grill you to death for like half an hour and slowly increase your options approval one step at a time (honestly some of those guys seem like idiots and I'm not sure how they got their certifications).  If they don't like exactly how you answer questions even as an experienced trader that's been doing it for a while, they will delay your application by up to 6 months before you can try again.  That hasn't happened to me fortunately but apparently they do that so I'm always very anxious talking to them.  I have $600k ish with them in all my accounts and my risk per trade is typically capped at $50-60k.  I tend to have extra cash if I need to average down or add something to hedge my position.  Never used margin even though I have it since it's required to do a lot of different trades.

* Frequent outages (especially at market open), error messages, slow to load in the browser portal.  Desktop platform ""StreetSmart"" is terrible IMO but I suppose that is a matter of taste.  They're portal option trading is otherwise aright, I've seen better and worse but nothing to write home about.

* $1k recently mysteriously disappeared in my account.  They were quick to correct it and apparently it's some ""very rare"" programming error but who the fuck knows for sure.  I'm sure a lot of retards out there don't even notice if money is ever missing.

* Finally, something that has always bothered me is that their execution doesn't seem that good.  With options especially +/- a couple pennies or (or nickel for larger contracts) can actually make a huge difference on your P&L for a trade.  They are THE LEADER in PFOF revenue.  Fuck them.


When I joined them close to 20 years ago, I worshiped Charles Schwab.  You can google him but he was Good Guy broker when no one cared about retail back in the day.  Basically the OG pioneered the discount brokerage business.  You should read about his life, such a cool mfer.  Anyways, the firm it is today is totally different and basically a scummy imposter just using the name, if you're thinking about joining.  DON'T.

A little bit about myself for context:

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/555339dhob071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42585b1cfe4cf1c85eab62b0cc01791f5321f1e2

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",nh8f2j,PUBM DD #1

8610,,2021-05-20 19:09:28,t3_nh8q8x,,wallstreetbets," So this is the first time I've ever played around with options and I'm probably doing it in a dumb way but get that's more fun for you guys to watch. I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let‚Äôs go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don‚Äôt need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there‚Äôs a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises.

UWMC has had a better post-earnings period not because their top line YOY growth was so good or even indicative of something remotely possible to sustain moving forward, but really just because of the dividend and chest pounding against RKT.

I have a position in both, and before either camp starts screaming about how one is more revolutionary, or has better blah blah blah, realize that the only thing driving price action for either is public sentiment. UWMC declared a regular dividend while RKT only a special.

It might be to their advantage to do so because they are able to profit off of the availability of COMEX -- but at what price?  
In other words, saving COMEX yet again may be becoming just too *expensive* for JPM's bean counters/risk managers.  
Or maybe they simply don't have the available unencumbered silver to do this with any longer.  
JPM and their billion ounce mountain of silver may be a paper tiger. 

&#x200B;

Lets dign in !

**Comex silver warehouse .... another 1,000,000 oz is OUT OF THE VAULT, 43,000,000 oz is gone since the silverbacks arrived. This time it is all HSBC bank. And what did big powerful JP Morgan do? Nothing!! Maybe all their silver eligible is spoken for.** 

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418.
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there‚Äôs at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don‚Äôt have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

Inflation is gonna destroy non-asset holders. I‚Äôm a bit worried about discount retail (5 below, DG, Dollar Tree) holding up because the business models are predicated on selling commodities at a certain price point. If commodity prices skyrocket dollar tree especially is gonna have a tough time adjusting since literally everything in their store is a dollar. So I think the better bet is to buy the actual companies that create goods that the poor are capable of buying (since inflation will eradicate much of the middle class.) Vizio products would never be sold in one of these stores but they sell really cheap TVs with internet accessibility. They sell a really good product considering the price point.

**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    
**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford‚Äôs finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford‚Äôs automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford‚Äôs $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford‚Äôs $160 billion debt load.

From old post:

1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

8653,,2021-05-21 09:36:45,t3_nhoi3w,,wallstreetbets,"Virgin Galactic announced they have a test flight scheduled for tomorrow and the stock moved up by 14% yesterday. I‚Äôm overall bearish on this company, as founder Richard Branson and SPAC-backer Chamath Palihapitiya have both sold basically all of their shares. Cathie Woods doesn‚Äôt even own it for ARK. 

I want to buy puts in anticipation of a drop Monday, this seems like the most likely outcome to me. Whether the launch is a failure or people just sell the news after a big move, it seems unlikely that it continues to rally Monday. There‚Äôs a lot of bag holders who bought at $40-60 a couple months ago that would love to get out if it bounces which would theoretically limit its possible gains Monday. On the chance the test flight greatly exceeds expectations or there is another announcement included along side the test, the stock could fly however. I feel that this is a slim but non-zero possibility. Basically whichever way it moves, it‚Äôs going to move hard. June 4th options have an IV of 165% per thinkorswim. 

My question is whether I am better off buying straight puts on $SPCE or if I should buy some sort of call/put spread to hedge my downside in the event the stock continues to fly Monday. My main concern is making the right move and still getting IV crushed. I‚Äôm looking at 6/4/21 $20 puts, or a spread at the same strike and expiry. In your opinions, is that a smart move or is there something else I should be considering? I‚Äôm still relatively new to trading options. 

Thanks for your input!

ReefShark is on track to reach 70% of 5G sales by year‚Äôs end. ReefShark is Nokia‚Äôs most recent semiconductor that powers its 5G base stations.

The ReefShark chipset is smaller, decreasing the antenna size by half, which makes these base stations less bulky and obtrusive.

8657,,2021-05-21 11:44:07,t3_nhqhhk,,wallstreetbets,"Explosive fires have started everywhere already. Stock markets are on fire and so are property markets, as well as bond and debt markets. The problem is that fires are initially explosive but always end up implosive. 

How predictable events are (and people). This is particularly true in the world economy. Empires come and go, economies boom and bust and new currencies come and without fail always go. All this happens with regularity. 

&#x200B;

 Everything really on fire :

 We have seen  about inflation running wild and it is not just happening in stocks. Property markets are literarily exploding, especially the high end. We see this all over the world and not just in the US. In the UK for example, HSBC stated that March saw the highest number of mortgages EVER issued. In Sweden properties sell for up to 40% above asking price in a frenzied bidding war and second hand leisure boats are in such demand that they cost virtually the same as a new boat. And if you want a new boat, there is none available until 2022. It also seems that people are desperate for company after the lockdowns as prices for puppies in the UK are up to 100% higher than last year.

 Yes, everything is really on fire as people are desperate to just spend, spend, spend after a year of lockdowns and restrictions. 

 AN ECONOMIC BUBBLE OF AIR

 Since air is free, governments can produce unlimited amounts of it. And without exception, gullible people want to believe that it is actually real money and not just empty air. The beauty for the government is that they can just produce and borrow trillions of dollars at ZERO cost. And by manipulating interest rates they can borrow this money also at virtually ZERO cost. 

 So first the government manufactures the money at no cost and then they pay NOTHING for the privilege of borrowing that money. 

 The money obviously creates massive bubbles in stocks, bonds, houses, used cars , boats, puppies and other massively overvalued investments and consumer items. 

 Just look at how, for example, the Dow has gone up **exponentially and parabolically** **in the last year in an historically unprecedented straight line.** 

&#x200B;

**US Federal Debt up 74X**  
**Total US debt up ‚Äúonly‚Äù 49X**  
**M2 Money Supply up 29X>**

**Debt to GDP 1971: 37% ‚Äì 2021: 127%**

 Bubbles are called bubbles because they consist of air. And when bubbles become too big, they ALWAYS and without fail burst and implode. 

 Technically markets are giving very clear signals that THE END IS NIGH.

Whether that means days weeks or a few months, is totally irrelevant. We know that we are at the end of the most remarkable period in history in regards to money, investments and the economy.

 GOLD, SILVER AND WEALTH PRESERVATION

Gold  and Silver  have not at all reflected the massive creation of money in the last 50 years. That catchup phase is likely to start very soon based on both fundamentals and technicals. 

As regards securing your finances in periods of crisis, gold and silver have always been critical to hold.

 Everyone can afford some gold or silver. An ounce of silver is $28 and one gramme of gold is $50. So saving in precious metals will not only be very useful but essential at whatever level you can afford.

 The upside potential for gold and silver is multiples of the current prices and that is at today‚Äôs price levels. Higher inflation could take the metals to unfathomable heights.

8659,,2021-05-21 12:45:14,t3_nhrmu8,,wallstreetbets,"FuboTV posted its Q1 results on the 11th. Seasonality in sports is obviously huge, with Q1 and Q2 being the worst periods of the season.

Consequently, there was always a sequential decline in the number of subscribers in Q1 and Q2 in 2019 and 2020. Typically between -8 and -9% sequentially. Given the amazing performance that was achieved in Q3 and Q4 last year, it was heavily expected that this Q1 would again see a decline in paid subscribers.

And then the results were published. For the first time in its history, Fubo delivered a sequential growth in paid subscribers and revenue in a Q1! The inflection point as been passed, the business momentum is stronger than the seasonality of sports. Looking ahead, with the Olympics, the soccer world cup qualifiers, the main leagues restarting everywhere, I expect massive growth in paid subscribers.

Now, onto the revenue side. The ARPU is approximately constant at around 69$/month since Q3 2020. The low seasonality of Q1 means that the relative share of ARPU due to the advertising is quite low compared to Q3 and Q4 last year. Which means that a great improvement of the subscription ARPU has been reached in Q1!

Now, when we'll go into Q3 and then Q4, with the absurd growth in number of subscribers and the massive gains from advertising, I'm expecting the ARPU to again grow. Expected advertising growth is 100% YOY.

And what happens when you combine massive subscribers and ARPU growth? You have massive results.

The cherries on the cake are:

1. Fubo betting which comes as a free version in Q3 and then paid version in Q4. It can be massive as Fubo will be the only player in the industry to control end to end the viewer/bettor experience.
2. International expansion, in Europe first probably, starting in 2022.
3. Accepting wagering in unconventional currencies.

I am not here to say the next crash will occur this October or on any other date (I well know that correlation is not causation). I have no subtle purpose to share, it's just for the curiosity of this pattern.

p.s. Probably the cause is because October is my birthday.

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes ‚Äì well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you‚Äôll double your money. This isn‚Äôt some wishy washy bullshit oh it‚Äôs going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it‚Äôs just a question of when. How can I be so sure? They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.

Should you trust me? Am I financial advisor ‚Äì good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips. Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago? We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can‚Äôt lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist? What the fuck does that mean ‚Äì fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill. Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn‚Äôt just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine ‚Äì kind of a big deal. They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year. Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe ‚Äì think FDA is going to delay?

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no. They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted. Added bonus ‚Äì Pfizer‚Äôs big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also ‚Äì or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain‚Äôt going cheap. They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner. Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn‚Äôt allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth. The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes ‚Äì former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius ‚Äì not piece of shit pharma we have here. Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks. You don‚Äôt have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear. No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential? Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities ‚Äì hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men‚Äôs lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself. Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant‚Äôs drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued. MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down - whatever could they do with that cash? $44 a share wouldn‚Äôt even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down. With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in ‚Äì remember this isn‚Äôt some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them. And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can‚Äôt see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone. FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they‚Äôve already approved in new indications like this one. Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point. It‚Äôs down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason. FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density ‚Äì the solution: they will monitor bone density. That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer. Even if they don‚Äôt Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs. Truly can‚Äôt fucking lose. so why is it trading so cheap? Well cause no one knows about it, and the upside is only written down in Japanese.",nhssad,Guaranteed Buyout and Doubling of Funds if grab Myovant (MYOV)

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks.  You don‚Äôt have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear.  No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential?  Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities ‚Äì hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men‚Äôs lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself.  Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant‚Äôs drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued.  MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down  - whatever could they do with that cash?  $44 a share wouldn‚Äôt even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down.  With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in ‚Äì remember this isn‚Äôt some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them.  And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can‚Äôt see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone.  FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they‚Äôve already approved in new indications like this one.  Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point.  It‚Äôs down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason.  FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density ‚Äì the solution:  they will monitor bone density.  That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer.  Even if they don‚Äôt Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs.  Truly can‚Äôt fucking lose.  so why is it trading so cheap? Well cause no one knows about it, and the upside is only written down in Japanese.",nhtad9,Guaranteed Buyout and Doubling of Funds if buy Myovant (MYOV)

UWMC is continuing the streak. As of 5/20/2021, UWMC is on NYSE Threshold Securities List every day for straight 17 days, (4/28/2021-5/20/2021 and still counting...)

I interpret this as a strong sign of a heavy and abusive short attack.

Previously, the only stock that made to the list for this long is GME. GME was on this list for 12 straight business days (1/19/2021 - 2/3/2021.)

8672,,2021-05-21 14:32:27,t3_nhtxml,,wallstreetbets,"**EDIT TLDR: OG chuck built an amazing pro retail firm that others slowly turned into PFOF grubby flaming pile of shit.**

Can't believe I'm gonna throw shade on a firm I used to love but they have REALLY gone down hill.  Don't feel like writing a wall of text but want to warn others who are thinking of switching into them so I'm just going to bullet point problems I've had.  If you are with them already and feel so-so about them... there are better options out there.  Moving money is a pain in the ass but it might be worth it.

**Issues I've had with them**

* Margin approval is like pulling teeth.  They want to grill you to death for like half an hour and slowly increase your options approval one step at a time (honestly some of those guys seem like idiots and I'm not sure how they got their certifications).  If they don't like exactly how you answer questions even as an experienced trader that's been doing it for a while, they will delay your application by up to 6 months before you can try again.  That hasn't happened to me fortunately but apparently they do that so I'm always very anxious talking to them.  I have $600k ish with them in all my accounts and my risk per trade is typically capped at $50-60k.  I tend to have extra cash if I need to average down or add something to hedge my position.  Never used margin even though I have it since it's required to do a lot of different trades.

* Frequent outages (especially at market open), error messages, slow to load in the browser portal.  Desktop platform ""StreetSmart"" is terrible IMO but I suppose that is a matter of taste.  They're portal option trading is otherwise aright, I've seen better and worse but nothing to write home about.

* $1k recently mysteriously disappeared in my account.  They were quick to correct it and apparently it's some ""very rare"" programming error but who the fuck knows for sure.  I'm sure a lot of retards out there don't even notice if money is ever missing.

* Finally, something that has always bothered me is that their execution doesn't seem that good.  With options especially +/- a couple pennies or (or nickel for larger contracts) can actually make a huge difference on your P&L for a trade.  They are THE LEADER in PFOF revenue.  Fuck them.


When I joined them close to 20 years ago, I worshiped Charles Schwab.  You can google him but he was Good Guy broker when no one cared about retail back in the day.  Basically the OG pioneered the discount brokerage business.  You should read about his life, such a cool mfer.  Anyways, the firm it is today is totally different and basically a scummy imposter just using the name, if you're thinking about joining.  DON'T.

On the 1H candles, break out over 50ma, resistance at 200ma, rsi peaking at 70, propably will come down to get support from 50ma again before breaking over the 200ma.

Nasdaq index looks to have made bottoms at 13000 and is on long trend again, or at least will go sideways for the summer period, between 13k and 14k.

2) You really need to understand what a P/E of 1200, or even 580 for that matter, means. If you look at the numbers Tesla simply isn‚Äôt that profitable of a company compared to its peers. It is not reasonable that overnight this technology that hasn‚Äôt been super profitable yet will miraculously increase they‚Äôre earnings 500x or 1000x. 
3) You should brush up on history of booms like Tesla. I don‚Äôt know why you would have ‚Äúinfinite comfort‚Äù if you knew anything about the 90s dot coms, the 80s growth stocks, the 60s tronics boom, 18th century south sea company, Mississippi trading company, etc. The current valuation of Tesla is simply not sustainable.

I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let‚Äôs go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don‚Äôt need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there‚Äôs a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

UWMC has had a better post-earnings period not because their top line YOY growth was so good or even indicative of something remotely possible to sustain moving forward, but really just because of the dividend and chest pounding against RKT.

I have a position in both, and before either camp starts screaming about how one is more revolutionary, or has better blah blah blah, realize that the only thing driving price action for either is public sentiment. UWMC declared a regular dividend while RKT only a special. 

Next week, either Jay Farner gets flashy (new dividend, massive auto rollout, something new) and starts publicly pushing back against Ishbia, or RKT continues downward. I think it‚Äôs 50/50 but looks ripe for anyone looking for a straddle yolo, with IV not as bad as it was before.

It might be to their advantage to do so because they are able to profit off of the availability of COMEX -- but at what price?  
In other words, saving COMEX yet again may be becoming just too *expensive* for JPM's bean counters/risk managers.  
Or maybe they simply don't have the available unencumbered silver to do this with any longer.  
JPM and their billion ounce mountain of silver may be a paper tiger. 

&#x200B;

Lets dign in !

**Comex silver warehouse .... another 1,000,000 oz is OUT OF THE VAULT, 43,000,000 oz is gone since the silverbacks arrived. This time it is all HSBC bank. And what did big powerful JP Morgan do? Nothing!! Maybe all their silver eligible is spoken for.** 

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

The long story can be read in the links below.

I have a back ordered Model X and a pissed wife with a baby ape growing inside of her. She's do in July, car was supposed to deliver June, instead they are telling me Oct - now I am hearing Feb 2022. 

I spoke to a sales rep at Tesla she says they haven't delivered any Model X or S this year and she doesn't think they will. TSLA is really effected by the chip shortage, orders from Dec. were promised Mar. & now they aren't expected till Oct and may be pushed back over all to 2022. Orders are being canceled, and you even have UFC fighters calling them out [https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-elon-musk-beneil-dariush-ufc-model-3-loaner/](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-elon-musk-beneil-dariush-ufc-model-3-loaner/) 

TBH I am just pissed Dariush gets a loaner and I don't, so I have decided to go about it my own way. I have puts and I am going to buy more puts tomorrow and hold it until it makes me enough money to buy my car cash. 

Support my vision fellow apes.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418.
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

However I was deep thinking, so I started digging.  We never recovered from the 08 crisis.  They just dropped interest rates and turned on the printer.  

Now in 11-12 I was a security guard for a company that made coins for the us mint/ tiff jewelry.  Gold was crazy 16-1700$ an once.  It‚Äôs gone up 150-200$ an oz in the decade where we printed more money than we have since our founding. 

What if the government knew they were fucked and told hedge funds to naked short everything till oblivion. 


Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there‚Äôs at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don‚Äôt have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.  

Apes look up academic papers from the 08 collapse and what‚Äôs going on now naked shorting is on the rise.

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

Inflation is gonna destroy non-asset holders. I‚Äôm a bit worried about discount retail (5 below, DG, Dollar Tree) holding up because the business models are predicated on selling commodities at a certain price point. If commodity prices skyrocket dollar tree especially is gonna have a tough time adjusting since literally everything in their store is a dollar. So I think the better bet is to buy the actual companies that create goods that the poor are capable of buying (since inflation will eradicate much of the middle class.) Vizio products would never be sold in one of these stores but they sell really cheap TVs with internet accessibility. They sell a really good product considering the price point. I check their books and it‚Äôs a profitable company that‚Äôs been improving margins that last two years.

**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    
**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford‚Äôs finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford‚Äôs automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford‚Äôs $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford‚Äôs $160 billion debt load.

From old post:

1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

I‚Äôm overall bearish on this company, as founder Richard Branson and SPAC-backer Chamath Palihapitiya have both sold basically all of their shares. Cathie Woods doesn‚Äôt even own it for ARK. 

I want to buy puts in anticipation of a drop Monday, this seems like the most likely outcome to me. Whether the launch is a failure or people just sell the news after a big move, it seems unlikely that it continues to rally Monday. There‚Äôs a lot of bag holders who bought at $40-60 a couple months ago that would love to get out if it bounces which would theoretically limit its possible gains Monday. On the chance the test flight greatly exceeds expectations or there is another announcement included along side the test, the stock could fly however. I feel that this is a slim but non-zero possibility. Basically whichever way it moves, it‚Äôs going to move hard. June 4th options have an IV of 165% per thinkorswim. 

My question is whether I am better off buying straight puts on $SPCE or if I should buy some sort of call/put spread to hedge my downside in the event the stock continues to fly Monday. My main concern is making the right move and still getting IV crushed. I‚Äôm looking at 6/4/21 $20 puts, or a spread at the same strike and expiry. In your opinions, is that a smart move or is there something else I should be considering? I‚Äôm still relatively new to trading options. 

Thanks for your input!

 Everything really on fire :

 We have seen  about inflation running wild and it is not just happening in stocks. Property markets are literarily exploding, especially the high end. We see this all over the world and not just in the US. In the UK for example, HSBC stated that March saw the highest number of mortgages EVER issued. In Sweden properties sell for up to 40% above asking price in a frenzied bidding war and second hand leisure boats are in such demand that they cost virtually the same as a new boat. And if you want a new boat, there is none available until 2022. It also seems that people are desperate for company after the lockdowns as prices for puppies in the UK are up to 100% higher than last year.

 Yes, everything is really on fire as people are desperate to just spend, spend, spend after a year of lockdowns and restrictions. 

 AN ECONOMIC BUBBLE OF AIR

 Since air is free, governments can produce unlimited amounts of it. And without exception, gullible people want to believe that it is actually real money and not just empty air. The beauty for the government is that they can just produce and borrow trillions of dollars at ZERO cost. And by manipulating interest rates they can borrow this money also at virtually ZERO cost. 

 So first the government manufactures the money at no cost and then they pay NOTHING for the privilege of borrowing that money. 

 The money obviously creates massive bubbles in stocks, bonds, houses, used cars , boats, puppies and other massively overvalued investments and consumer items. 

 Just look at how, for example, the Dow has gone up **exponentially and parabolically** **in the last year in an historically unprecedented straight line.**

**US Federal Debt up 74X**  
**Total US debt up ‚Äúonly‚Äù 49X**  
**M2 Money Supply up 29X>**

**Debt to GDP 1971: 37% ‚Äì 2021: 127%**

 Bubbles are called bubbles because they consist of air. And when bubbles become too big, they ALWAYS and without fail burst and implode. 

 Technically markets are giving very clear signals that THE END IS NIGH.

Whether that means days weeks or a few months, is totally irrelevant. We know that we are at the end of the most remarkable period in history in regards to money, investments and the economy.

 GOLD, SILVER AND WEALTH PRESERVATION

Gold  and Silver  have not at all reflected the massive creation of money in the last 50 years. That catchup phase is likely to start very soon based on both fundamentals and technicals. 

As regards securing your finances in periods of crisis, gold and silver have always been critical to hold.

 Everyone can afford some gold or silver. An ounce of silver is $28 and one gramme of gold is $50. So saving in precious metals will not only be very useful but essential at whatever level you can afford.

 The upside potential for gold and silver is multiples of the current prices and that is at today‚Äôs price levels. Higher inflation could take the metals to unfathomable heights.

Consequently, there was always a sequential decline in the number of subscribers in Q1 and Q2 in 2019 and 2020. Typically between -8 and -9% sequentially. Given the amazing performance that was achieved in Q3 and Q4 last year, it was heavily expected that this Q1 would again see a decline in paid subscribers.

And then the results were published. For the first time in its history, Fubo delivered a sequential growth in paid subscribers and revenue in a Q1! The inflection point as been passed, the business momentum is stronger than the seasonality of sports. Looking ahead, with the Olympics, the soccer world cup qualifiers, the main leagues restarting everywhere, I expect massive growth in paid subscribers.

Now, onto the revenue side. The ARPU is approximately constant at around 69$/month since Q3 2020. The low seasonality of Q1 means that the relative share of ARPU due to the advertising is quite low compared to Q3 and Q4 last year. Which means that a great improvement of the subscription ARPU has been reached in Q1!

Now, when we'll go into Q3 and then Q4, with the absurd growth in number of subscribers and the massive gains from advertising, I'm expecting the ARPU to again grow. Expected advertising growth is 100% YOY.

And what happens when you combine massive subscribers and ARPU growth? You have massive results.

The cherries on the cake are:

1. Fubo betting which comes as a free version in Q3 and then paid version in Q4. It can be massive as Fubo will be the only player in the industry to control end to end the viewer/bettor experience.
2. International expansion, in Europe first probably, starting in 2022.
3. Accepting wagering in unconventional currencies.

I am not here to say the next crash will occur this October or on any other date (I well know that correlation is not causation). I have no subtle purpose to share, it's just for the curiosity of this pattern.

p.s. Probably the cause is because October is my birthday.

How can I be so sure? They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.

Should you trust me?

Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago? We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can‚Äôt lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist? What the fuck does that mean ‚Äì fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill. Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn‚Äôt just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine ‚Äì kind of a big deal. They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year. Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe ‚Äì think FDA is going to delay?

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no. They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted. Added bonus ‚Äì Pfizer‚Äôs big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also ‚Äì or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain‚Äôt going cheap. They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner. Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn‚Äôt allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth. The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes ‚Äì former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius ‚Äì not piece of shit pharma we have here. Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks. You don‚Äôt have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear. No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential? Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities ‚Äì hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men‚Äôs lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself. Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant‚Äôs drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued. MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down - whatever could they do with that cash? $44 a share wouldn‚Äôt even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down. With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in ‚Äì remember this isn‚Äôt some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them. And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can‚Äôt see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone. FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they‚Äôve already approved in new indications like this one. Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point. It‚Äôs down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason. FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density ‚Äì the solution: they will monitor bone density.

These fragments are believed to be made of an unknown metal/alloy, and potentially 3D printed at an atomic level.

**Long-Northrup Grumman ($NOC)** is a defense giant which developed the B-2 stealth bomber and is a contractor on multiple space infrastructure missions. They would be vital for advanced composites/metallurgy, advanced avionics, spaceflight, and tracking systems.

9078,,2021-05-21 14:32:27,t3_nhtxml,,wallstreetbets,"**EDIT TLDR: OG chuck built an amazing pro retail firm that others slowly turned into PFOF grubby flaming pile of shit.**

Can't believe I'm gonna throw shade on a firm I used to love but they have REALLY gone down hill.  Don't feel like writing a wall of text but want to warn others who are thinking of switching into them so I'm just going to bullet point problems I've had.  If you are with them already and feel so-so about them... there are better options out there.  Moving money is a pain in the ass but it might be worth it.

**Issues I've had with them**

* Margin approval is like pulling teeth.  They want to grill you to death for like half an hour and slowly increase your options approval one step at a time (honestly some of those guys seem like idiots and I'm not sure how they got their certifications).  If they don't like exactly how you answer questions even as an experienced trader that's been doing it for a while, they will delay your application by up to 6 months before you can try again.  That hasn't happened to me fortunately but apparently they do that so I'm always very anxious talking to them.  I have $600k ish with them in all my accounts and my risk per trade is typically capped at $50-60k.  I tend to have extra cash if I need to average down or add something to hedge my position.  Never used margin even though I have it since it's required to do a lot of different trades.

* Frequent outages (especially at market open), error messages, slow to load in the browser portal.  Desktop platform ""StreetSmart"" is terrible IMO but I suppose that is a matter of taste.  They're portal option trading is otherwise aright, I've seen better and worse but nothing to write home about.

* $1k recently mysteriously disappeared in my account.  They were quick to correct it and apparently it's some ""very rare"" programming error but who the fuck knows for sure.  I'm sure a lot of retards out there don't even notice if money is ever missing.

* Finally, something that has always bothered me is that their execution doesn't seem that good.  With options especially +/- a couple pennies or (or nickel for larger contracts) can actually make a huge difference on your P&L for a trade.  They are THE LEADER in PFOF revenue.  Fuck them.


When I joined them close to 20 years ago, I worshiped Charles Schwab.  You can google him but he was Good Guy broker when no one cared about retail back in the day.  Basically the OG pioneered the discount brokerage business.  You should read about his life, such a cool mfer.  Anyways, the firm it is today is totally different and basically a scummy imposter just using the name, if you're thinking about joining.  DON'T.

Good support on the \~74$ line, looks to be holding, my personal stop loss is at 70$ if that breaks it's open to free fall.

On the 1H candles, break out over 50ma, resistance at 200ma, rsi peaking at 70, propably will come down to get support from 50ma again before breaking over the 200ma.

Nasdaq index looks to have made bottoms at 13000 and is on long trend again, or at least will go sideways for the summer period, between 13k and 14k.

NOT a investing advice, personally im long with 2040 shares target 100$ average price 77$

A lot can happen in 6 months, I actively follow the movements and if something happens am ready to sell early and buyback when TA looks good again.

There is also a chance they end up trying to pursue smaller jets rather than go in commercial. Lots of possibilities. Then you also have other companies in the same space seeking a quad copter approach towards regional transportation, like 4 to 500 miles. But this is not what the valuation stems from, I am just speaking in the very long term

2. You do realize that the biggest companies on the NASDAQ all at times had similar ratios? Go look at what Amazons was. Pointing to a high ratio is like the dumbest fucking argument because it completely ignores the fact that skyhigh ratios exist for a reason. Expectations of growth. What do you think will happen to the ratio when Austin and Berlin are both fully online? 

3. Just because you can refer past bubbles doesn‚Äôt mean that this is a bubble.

Let me leave you with one final thought. When you look at the cost per car, most of that is due to battery costs. Tesla has battery technology they will provide higher power output and density per dollar than its competitors in a huge way. Then, on top of that, you take into account the economies of scale they are going to achieve, and low cost they are going to achieve with the casting machines. What you get is a car body that is cheaper then the competitors, with battery technology that can provide the same range, acceleration, and longevity for a far cheaper price. Add to that the insurance angle and you have a total car that can be produced far more cheaply than anyone else, the profit margin‚Äòs will be very high. 

And this ignores the energy sector, this ignores the software angle. This ignores the fact that dojo will soon be the most powerful dumb AI in the world for creating dumb AI solutions to other things. This ignores the fact that tesla can play it‚Äôs engineer and and battery advantages into many more fields.",,

I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let‚Äôs go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don‚Äôt need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there‚Äôs a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

There is little difference in their lines of business at the moment, margins are similar, products are similar. There‚Äôs very little differentiation, he‚Äôll they‚Äôre in the same city. UWMC has had a better post-earnings period not because their top line YOY growth was so good or even indicative of something remotely possible to sustain moving forward, but really just because of the dividend and chest pounding against RKT.

I have a position in both, and before either camp starts screaming about how one is more revolutionary, or has better blah blah blah, realize that the only thing driving price action for either is public sentiment. UWMC declared a regular dividend while RKT only a special. 

Next week, either Jay Farner gets flashy (new dividend, massive auto rollout, something new) and starts publicly pushing back against Ishbia, or RKT continues downward. I think it‚Äôs 50/50 but looks ripe for anyone looking for a straddle yolo, with IV not as bad as it was before.

It might be to their advantage to do so because they are able to profit off of the availability of COMEX -- but at what price?  
In other words, saving COMEX yet again may be becoming just too *expensive* for JPM's bean counters/risk managers.  
Or maybe they simply don't have the available unencumbered silver to do this with any longer.  
JPM and their billion ounce mountain of silver may be a paper tiger. 

&#x200B;

Lets dign in !

**Comex silver warehouse .... another 1,000,000 oz is OUT OF THE VAULT, 43,000,000 oz is gone since the silverbacks arrived. This time it is all HSBC bank. And what did big powerful JP Morgan do? Nothing!! Maybe all their silver eligible is spoken for.** 

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

The long story can be read in the links below.

I spoke to a sales rep at Tesla she says they haven't delivered any Model X or S this year and she doesn't think they will.

W-shape with today's price action.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418.
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

However I was deep thinking, so I started digging.  We never recovered from the 08 crisis.  They just dropped interest rates and turned on the printer.  

Now in 11-12 I was a security guard for a company that made coins for the us mint/ tiff jewelry.  Gold was crazy 16-1700$ an once.  It‚Äôs gone up 150-200$ an oz in the decade where we printed more money than we have since our founding. 

What if the government knew they were fucked and told hedge funds to naked short everything till oblivion. 


Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there‚Äôs at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don‚Äôt have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.  

Apes look up academic papers from the 08 collapse and what‚Äôs going on now naked shorting is on the rise.

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

TLDR; BIGC good, like SHOP, but undervalued.

Inflation is gonna destroy non-asset holders. I‚Äôm a bit worried about discount retail (5 below, DG, Dollar Tree) holding up because the business models are predicated on selling commodities at a certain price point. If commodity prices skyrocket dollar tree especially is gonna have a tough time adjusting since literally everything in their store is a dollar. So I think the better bet is to buy the actual companies that create goods that the poor are capable of buying (since inflation will eradicate much of the middle class.) Vizio products would never be sold in one of these stores but they sell really cheap TVs with internet accessibility. They sell a really good product considering the price point. I check their books and it‚Äôs a profitable company that‚Äôs been improving margins that last two years.

**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    
**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford‚Äôs finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford‚Äôs automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford‚Äôs $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford‚Äôs $160 billion debt load.

From old post:

1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

9585,,2021-05-21 09:36:45,t3_nhoi3w,,wallstreetbets,"Virgin Galactic announced they have a test flight scheduled for tomorrow and the stock moved up by 14% yesterday. I‚Äôm overall bearish on this company, as founder Richard Branson and SPAC-backer Chamath Palihapitiya have both sold basically all of their shares. Cathie Woods doesn‚Äôt even own it for ARK. 

I want to buy puts in anticipation of a drop Monday, this seems like the most likely outcome to me. Whether the launch is a failure or people just sell the news after a big move, it seems unlikely that it continues to rally Monday. There‚Äôs a lot of bag holders who bought at $40-60 a couple months ago that would love to get out if it bounces which would theoretically limit its possible gains Monday. On the chance the test flight greatly exceeds expectations or there is another announcement included along side the test, the stock could fly however. I feel that this is a slim but non-zero possibility. Basically whichever way it moves, it‚Äôs going to move hard. June 4th options have an IV of 165% per thinkorswim. 

My question is whether I am better off buying straight puts on $SPCE or if I should buy some sort of call/put spread to hedge my downside in the event the stock continues to fly Monday. My main concern is making the right move and still getting IV crushed. I‚Äôm looking at 6/4/21 $20 puts, or a spread at the same strike and expiry. In your opinions, is that a smart move or is there something else I should be considering? I‚Äôm still relatively new to trading options. 

Thanks for your input!

ReefShark is on track to reach 70% of 5G sales by year‚Äôs end. ReefShark is Nokia‚Äôs most recent semiconductor that powers its 5G base stations.

The ReefShark chipset is smaller, decreasing the antenna size by half, which makes these base stations less bulky and obtrusive. It helps enable a 50 ‚Äì 60% reduction in energy use compared to previous chips.

9589,,2021-05-21 11:44:07,t3_nhqhhk,,wallstreetbets,"Explosive fires have started everywhere already. Stock markets are on fire and so are property markets, as well as bond and debt markets. The problem is that fires are initially explosive but always end up implosive. 

How predictable events are (and people). This is particularly true in the world economy. Empires come and go, economies boom and bust and new currencies come and without fail always go. All this happens with regularity. 

&#x200B;

 Everything really on fire :

 We have seen  about inflation running wild and it is not just happening in stocks. Property markets are literarily exploding, especially the high end. We see this all over the world and not just in the US. In the UK for example, HSBC stated that March saw the highest number of mortgages EVER issued. In Sweden properties sell for up to 40% above asking price in a frenzied bidding war and second hand leisure boats are in such demand that they cost virtually the same as a new boat. And if you want a new boat, there is none available until 2022. It also seems that people are desperate for company after the lockdowns as prices for puppies in the UK are up to 100% higher than last year.

 Yes, everything is really on fire as people are desperate to just spend, spend, spend after a year of lockdowns and restrictions. 

 AN ECONOMIC BUBBLE OF AIR

 Since air is free, governments can produce unlimited amounts of it. And without exception, gullible people want to believe that it is actually real money and not just empty air. The beauty for the government is that they can just produce and borrow trillions of dollars at ZERO cost. And by manipulating interest rates they can borrow this money also at virtually ZERO cost. 

 So first the government manufactures the money at no cost and then they pay NOTHING for the privilege of borrowing that money. 

 The money obviously creates massive bubbles in stocks, bonds, houses, used cars , boats, puppies and other massively overvalued investments and consumer items. 

 Just look at how, for example, the Dow has gone up **exponentially and parabolically** **in the last year in an historically unprecedented straight line.**

**US Federal Debt up 74X**  
**Total US debt up ‚Äúonly‚Äù 49X**  
**M2 Money Supply up 29X>**

**Debt to GDP 1971: 37% ‚Äì 2021: 127%**

 Bubbles are called bubbles because they consist of air. And when bubbles become too big, they ALWAYS and without fail burst and implode. 

 Technically markets are giving very clear signals that THE END IS NIGH.

Whether that means days weeks or a few months, is totally irrelevant. We know that we are at the end of the most remarkable period in history in regards to money, investments and the economy.

 GOLD, SILVER AND WEALTH PRESERVATION

Gold  and Silver  have not at all reflected the massive creation of money in the last 50 years. That catchup phase is likely to start very soon based on both fundamentals and technicals. 

As regards securing your finances in periods of crisis, gold and silver have always been critical to hold.

 Everyone can afford some gold or silver. An ounce of silver is $28 and one gramme of gold is $50. So saving in precious metals will not only be very useful but essential at whatever level you can afford.

 The upside potential for gold and silver is multiples of the current prices and that is at today‚Äôs price levels. Higher inflation could take the metals to unfathomable heights.

9591,,2021-05-21 12:45:14,t3_nhrmu8,,wallstreetbets,"FuboTV posted its Q1 results on the 11th. Seasonality in sports is obviously huge, with Q1 and Q2 being the worst periods of the season.

Consequently, there was always a sequential decline in the number of subscribers in Q1 and Q2 in 2019 and 2020. Typically between -8 and -9% sequentially. Given the amazing performance that was achieved in Q3 and Q4 last year, it was heavily expected that this Q1 would again see a decline in paid subscribers.

And then the results were published. For the first time in its history, Fubo delivered a sequential growth in paid subscribers and revenue in a Q1! The inflection point as been passed, the business momentum is stronger than the seasonality of sports. Looking ahead, with the Olympics, the soccer world cup qualifiers, the main leagues restarting everywhere, I expect massive growth in paid subscribers.

Now, onto the revenue side. The ARPU is approximately constant at around 69$/month since Q3 2020. The low seasonality of Q1 means that the relative share of ARPU due to the advertising is quite low compared to Q3 and Q4 last year. Which means that a great improvement of the subscription ARPU has been reached in Q1!

Now, when we'll go into Q3 and then Q4, with the absurd growth in number of subscribers and the massive gains from advertising, I'm expecting the ARPU to again grow. Expected advertising growth is 100% YOY.

And what happens when you combine massive subscribers and ARPU growth? You have massive results.

The cherries on the cake are:

1. Fubo betting which comes as a free version in Q3 and then paid version in Q4. It can be massive as Fubo will be the only player in the industry to control end to end the viewer/bettor experience.
2. International expansion, in Europe first probably, starting in 2022.
3. Accepting wagering in unconventional currencies.

I have no subtle purpose to share, it's just for the curiosity of this pattern.

p.s. Probably the cause is because October is my birthday.

How can I be so sure? They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.

Should you trust me?

Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago? We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can‚Äôt lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist? What the fuck does that mean ‚Äì fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill. Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn‚Äôt just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine ‚Äì kind of a big deal. They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year. Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe ‚Äì think FDA is going to delay?

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no. They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted. Added bonus ‚Äì Pfizer‚Äôs big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also ‚Äì or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain‚Äôt going cheap. They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner. Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn‚Äôt allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth. The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes ‚Äì former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius ‚Äì not piece of shit pharma we have here. Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks. You don‚Äôt have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear. No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential? Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities ‚Äì hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men‚Äôs lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself. Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant‚Äôs drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued. MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down - whatever could they do with that cash? $44 a share wouldn‚Äôt even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down. With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in ‚Äì remember this isn‚Äôt some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them.

9604,,2021-05-21 14:32:27,t3_nhtxml,,wallstreetbets,"**EDIT TLDR: OG chuck built an amazing pro retail firm that others slowly turned into PFOF grubby flaming pile of shit.**

Can't believe I'm gonna throw shade on a firm I used to love but they have REALLY gone down hill.  Don't feel like writing a wall of text but want to warn others who are thinking of switching into them so I'm just going to bullet point problems I've had.  If you are with them already and feel so-so about them... there are better options out there.  Moving money is a pain in the ass but it might be worth it.

**Issues I've had with them**

* Margin approval is like pulling teeth.  They want to grill you to death for like half an hour and slowly increase your options approval one step at a time (honestly some of those guys seem like idiots and I'm not sure how they got their certifications).  If they don't like exactly how you answer questions even as an experienced trader that's been doing it for a while, they will delay your application by up to 6 months before you can try again.  That hasn't happened to me fortunately but apparently they do that so I'm always very anxious talking to them.  I have $600k ish with them in all my accounts and my risk per trade is typically capped at $50-60k.  I tend to have extra cash if I need to average down or add something to hedge my position.  Never used margin even though I have it since it's required to do a lot of different trades.

* Frequent outages (especially at market open), error messages, slow to load in the browser portal.  Desktop platform ""StreetSmart"" is terrible IMO but I suppose that is a matter of taste.  They're portal option trading is otherwise aright, I've seen better and worse but nothing to write home about.

* $1k recently mysteriously disappeared in my account.  They were quick to correct it and apparently it's some ""very rare"" programming error but who the fuck knows for sure.  I'm sure a lot of retards out there don't even notice if money is ever missing.

* Finally, something that has always bothered me is that their execution doesn't seem that good.  With options especially +/- a couple pennies or (or nickel for larger contracts) can actually make a huge difference on your P&L for a trade.  They are THE LEADER in PFOF revenue.  Fuck them.


When I joined them close to 20 years ago, I worshiped Charles Schwab.  You can google him but he was Good Guy broker when no one cared about retail back in the day.  Basically the OG pioneered the discount brokerage business.  You should read about his life, such a cool mfer.  Anyways, the firm it is today is totally different and basically a scummy imposter just using the name, if you're thinking about joining.  DON'T.

On the 1H candles, break out over 50ma, resistance at 200ma, rsi peaking at 70, propably will come down to get support from 50ma again before breaking over the 200ma.

Nasdaq index looks to have made bottoms at 13000 and is on long trend again, or at least will go sideways for the summer period, between 13k and 14k.

The way I see it is there is no way that the price of SPCE will stay the same from today going into Monday. 

One of three options are going to play out.

1. Successful test flight
2. Test flight delayed, again 
3. Unsuccessful test flight

Regardless of the situation, the needle is going to move a LOT. How are you playing this rocket ride? 

I have a few 17p and 16p expiring Monday and a few HUGELY OTM calls expiring next Friday. I‚Äôm more expecting a total failure, but on the off chance it‚Äôs a huge success those calls are going to print.

What are y‚Äôall‚Äôs positions?

And to all the people saying you wouldn‚Äôt touch SPCE with a 40 foot pole, why? The stock is going to move one way or another and if you‚Äôre really that against it, buy puts and put your Twitter fingers to work.
