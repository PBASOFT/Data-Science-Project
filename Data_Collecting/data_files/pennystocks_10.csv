https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/nl5l8b/pqeff_third_party_buyer_in_europe_has_filed_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

The only thing that“s bothering me with this post, is that it only focusses on the third party buyer. 

I understand that people in the comments are sceptical about the deal. So am I, but Petroteq‘s potential to be a tenbagger doesn‘t only come from that deal. 

Let‘s do a bit of maths to prove that:

Petroteq runs one oil plant in Utah at the moment. It has recommenced just today:

https://www.google.de/amp/s/www.wallstreet-online.de/_amp/nachricht/13969538-petroteq-energy-announces-that-production-of-oil-from-the-posp-has-recommenced

The oil price per Barrel is sitting at about 65$ per Barrel right now.
They spend 20$ on the process gathering 1 barrel of oil.
That equals to 45$ profit per Barrel.

With their running plant, they can harvest up to 5000 Barrels per day.

5000 Barrels x 45$ = 225.000$ profit per day.

That equals to 82.125.000$ profit per year. 

This does only correspond to one plant! Imagine the profit we‘re seeing with two or three plants. Even with further sinking oil prices, that‘s a huge profit.

At a P/E ratio of 10 that adds up to a MC of around 800Million (P/E better than shell, exxon, etc.)

As of today, the MC is at 50 Million, which means that only with their first plant, the market price is going to rise to a minimum of 16x the one we‘re at now. 

Not only does that explain why a third-party would like to buy a big part of the company for a price 5x higher than the actual one, it also means that we‘re definately going to see an, at least equally big, rise without the deal happening. 

So no matter if the deal is going to happen or not, the potential is huge on this one.
Even if it‘s going to happen, that won‘t be the end of it. 

Thank‘s for your attention and as always, do your own dd.",nm4yvh,Petroteq Energy - Insane Potential

**Looks like a good swing trade here**

  
Rare opportunity for an up and comer in two hot sectors.  
   
Good day everyone,  
   
We are updating our coverage of **SponsorsOne Inc. (OTC: SPONF),** **(CSE: SPO)** a company that works with brands to build and manage exclusive and highly engaged communities of influencers within the social realm and a distributor of alcoholic beverages.  
   
**Current price     $.032/share**  
   
We reported on SPONF April 12, 2021 because the shares were affordable, and **the company had entered the Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) alcoholic beverage market**. We are reporting again today for the same reasons, but with some exciting new developments to include.  
   
We want to note from the [company stock chart](https://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=SPONF) that on February 19, 2021, after announcing their entry into the DTC alcohol business, SPONF shares hit a high of $.11/share, **355% above the current price**.  
   
These are exciting times for SPONF. There are new sectors that come to market all the time and this company has seized upon two of the hottest ones right now, hemp cigarettes and Direct to Consumer alcohol.  
   
SPONF has [entered the Hemp cigarette (aka CBD) market](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sponsorsone-announces-entry-pre-rolled-130000546.html). What is a hemp cigarette? Hemp cigarettes don’t get a smoker high. Hemp cigarettes look and feel just like a tobacco cigarette, but there is no nicotine or toxic additives, and they are made from the flower of hemp plants. **The move into hemp cigarettes may be transformative for SPONF**.  
   
Neilson Research expects the smokable Hemp market to reach $300 to $400 million by 2025, up from the current market of $70M. On March 30, 2021, **SPONF secured a five-year purchase and manufacturing supply agreement and anticipates the first production run of its proprietary Brand to be completed by the end of Q2 2021.**  
   
The FDA and the Biden administration are contemplating a severe restriction on the amount of nicotine in cigarettes, and hemp cigarettes, absent nicotine, may fit with that goal. The FDA started their campaign to get addictive nicotine out of cigarettes in 2018, but it’s just now getting traction.  
   
We told you previously about SPONF entering the DTC alcohol business and their lead product in that market, [Doc Wyler’s alcohol Infused Lemonades](https://www.docwylders.com/). This week the company announced that demand for Doc Wyler’s has been strong enough that they had to [contract with another co-packing/production](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sponsorsone-increases-production-capacity-meet-130000746.html) company to increase production capacity by a factor of 4.0X.  
   
SPONF may be set up for a near term gain. Momentum from the two new product lines and the chart set up seem to indicate exactly that. **The timing here could provide a great swing opportunity for our group.**  
   
Stay tuned for our full report on SPONF recent developments to be issued later today.

Announced earlier this morning. Vote for the split was approved by the shareholders in December of 2020. Deadline was in June. Company just reported a profitable Q1 and projects a yearly revenue of $45,000,000 in 2021.

I believe canceling the split is a great sign of strength and optimism for the stock and the company. 

Current SP is .0599. That is trading under 1x 2020 revenues of ~$40M. In my opinion, I believe the company is severely undervalued.

This is a really cool watch if this stuff interests you (12 min), and I'll do a short DD piece on the company below as well. 

&#x200B;

[The 12 minute corporate overview of the company goes over what theyre aiming to do, going over their executive team and their background, the scientific advisor board and what investors should expect by investing in $MYND:    https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=IucbGuMnFZU&t ](https://preview.redd.it/drn11938mn171.png?width=1223&format=png&auto=webp&s=238d5f4c814c7211d1f88e62bf2ddbaa829e2217)

**The Company:**  


MYND Life Sciences is looking to use a single molecule of psilocybin (magic mushrooms) to target inflammation in a specific gene in our body. Their research over the last 8-10 years points towards inflammation being the root cause of depression. So instead of getting high on a trip and going to a clinic with trained professionals to treat depression (the more common way psychedelics are used as medicine), they're looking to create a non-psychoactive drug to take to market. This is what makes them unique imo.  


**The Exec Team:**

There's more and more psychedelic companies popping up over the last 2 years, so this is where you need to look to make sure its a real company and not just trying to jump on the hype. If you **go to the interview** the start going into detail on the executives and science advisory board members **at 5:23**. These guys put together a stellar team and their founder Dr. Jefferies has over 60 patents under his belt.   


**The Stock:**

So they just started trading on Wednesday on the CSE under $MYND. They've got \~53M shares outstanding and raised at $0.30 before going public. It was a really hot start to trading, and clearly people aren't willing to sell many shares given the L2 has almost no asks. Just keep in mind this is a LT play, and prices fluctuate quite a bit that first week or so of going public. So if the story grabs your attn, looking for a good entry point is important, while also realizing this is a biotech play so a quick flip probably isnt the MO. These are those ones you expect a longer term horizon but if they're successful with their numerous trials, they tap into a multi-billion dollar industry with a feel good product that has zero addiction to it.  


Ultimately, from all the psyche companies I put money into, this is one of the ones Im the most excited about because it hits home with some depression issues in family members Ive experienced over my life. So its got that added reason for why i put my money into them with a LT perspective hoping that these guys can help change the game for those suffering from MDD.",nm6gmp,Easily The Most Unique Potential Use of Psilocybin For Depression You'll of Heard of Before (CSE:MYND)

They'd essentially make a prescription drug that you wouldnt get high from, and didnt need a clinic for. It would target inflammation in a specific gene in your body that would then treat the bodily aspect of whats causing your depression.  


Id think there would still definitely need to be work with trained professionals as you dont just snap your fingers and depression is gone lol.

Tellurian said the agreement represents the equivalent of about $12 billion in revenue over the 10-year term.

-Gross margin of 37% in Q1 2021, compared with 33% in Q4 2020
-Cash and cash equivalents of $12.4 million as of March 31, 2021
-Strong brand performance, with approximately 747,927 Branded Units sold in Q1 2021 (a 44% increase over Q1 2020)

-Revenue for Q1 2021 was $9.9 million, compared with $4.7 million in Q1 2020 and $9.7 million in Q4 2020. The primary driver of growth was strong demand in the Company's core markets of Colorado and Oregon as well as the consolidation of wholesale revenue. Similar strength in the Company's emerging markets also contributed to growth, as did the successful launch of new products including Lunchbox Alchemy CBD.

-Gross profit of $3.71 million (37% gross margin) in Q1 2021, compared with $2.85 million (61% gross margin) in Q1 2020 and $3.16 million (33% gross margin) in Q4 2020. In 2020 sales were primarily comprised of licensing and packaging revenue. This represented lower topline revenue but higher gross margin percentages, with lower gross profit dollars. With the consolidation of our operations in our core markets2 we are now generating higher topline revenue with lower gross margin percentages and higher gross profit dollars. The increase in margin from Q4 2020 is a result of fully consolidating the economics of our Colorado manufacturing partner from December 31, 2020.

-Adjusted EBITDA (LBITDA) of ($0.96 million) in Q1 2021, compared with ($2.7 million) in Q1 2020. The reduction of the Adjusted EBITDA loss is primarily attributable to an increase in revenue and a reduction in operating expenses. The increase in revenue in Q1 2021 of $5.23M which represents a 112% increase can be attributed to the Company's consolidation of its core market operations as described above.

-$12.4 million of cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2021, compared to $6.5 million at December 31, 2020. This includes proceeds from an oversubscribed private placement (the ""Financing"") for aggregate gross proceeds of $11.9 million, led by cannabis-focused private equity firm Merida Capital Holdings.",,

Just Placed a DTC Alcohol Order for SponsorsOne (SPONF) Doc Wyler’s Infused Lemonade  
   
Good day everyone,  
   
SponsorsOne Inc. (OTC: SPONF), (CSE: SPO) a company that works with brands to build and manage communities of influencers within the social realm, a DTC distributor of alcoholic beverages, and a developer of hemp cigarettes.  
   
Current price     $.031/share  
   
SPONF has been a development stage company but is now selling a product. The company shares may be looked at differently once the company reports revenues. The last available financial report is from the period ended 12-31-20, so new financials could come anytime.  
   
SPONF has already taken purchase orders for Doc Wyler’s Infused Lemonade. As they build the Doc Wyler’s distribution network, the purchase orders keep coming and, you can buy Doc Wyler’s Lemonades online. We know you can buy online because we did. We bought the Tequila Infused Margarita Lemonade.  
   
Doc Wyler’s is available on the Great American Craft Spirits Website. The transaction was smooth and easy but there were fees for adult verification and shipping. The fees were not unlike you would pay for Doordash or Uber Eats (except for the adult verification fee), but our Doc Wyler’s order is coming right to our door.  
   
The company formed a wholly owned subsidiary, HS Brands, Inc., to develop and distribute hemp cigarettes. On March 30, 2021, SPONF secured a five-year purchase and manufacturing supply agreement with a six-generation tobacco cultivation and processing company for their pre-rolled hemp cigarettes. The absence of nicotine and the additives found in tobacco cigarettes could be a deterrent to smoking.  
   
The SponsorsCloudTM platform and associated applications & products continue to be developed towards commercial readiness   The on-going maturation of the social media market is creating many opportunities for new ways to leverage social media and build value utilizing social media. Also, the convergence of social media and digital media is a trend that is creating much opportunity. SPONF is strategically positioned directly within this convergence.  
   
The company has the three verticals mentioned above as potential streams of revenue. As we said earlier, SPONF shares gained to $.11/share just on the announcement of entering the DTC alcohol sector. What do YOU think could happen when they start to report revenues?

My outlook has only improved. They actually turned PROFITABLE in Q1. Net profitable. That's extremely rare in the world of OTC. Their debt is nearly paid off and they're very cash flow positive.   


They're the biggest steal in all of OTC at the current price. It is absurd. They had to enter a ""quiet period"" (No PR'ing new information etc) as part of their uplisting process and unfortunately this has made them an easy target for shorting and hence the share price has been battered down from .20 to as low as .055 recently.   


I and numerous others have been continuing to add to our existing holdings through all of this.

343,,2021-05-27 14:26:31,t3_nm8nkz,,pennystocks,"Clear Blue Technologies, an off grid wireless power company from Canada released their 1st quarter financial results today. 

Highlights from their website:

On a Trailing Four Quarter basis:
-TFQ Revenue was $7,244,647, an 87% increase over the previous TFQ period;
-Gross profit for TFQ was $1,941,028 or 27%, a 125% increase from the previous period ($862,030 or 22%);
-Operating expenses for the TFQ ended March 31, 2021, were $4,389,751, a decrease of $1,026,854 or 19% compared to the same period in 2020;
-Non-IFRS Adjusted EBITDA for the TFQ was $(3,103,830) compared to $(3,673,380) for the previous TFQ. This 16% improvement resulted from higher revenue with improved margins of 27% compared to 22% for the comparative TFQ of 2020.

For the quarterly Q1 2021 results:
-Q1 quarterly revenues were $3,459,007, a 1,352 % increase over $238,171 for Q1 2020, which is directly attributed to revenue from two previously announced contracts with telecom infrastructure operators in Africa.
-Gross profit for Q1 was $751,163 or 22% compared to $77,134 for Q1 2020, a significant increase resulting from higher revenue for the quarter.
-Quarterly operating expenses decreased by $239,473 to $1,024,864 for the three-month period ended March 31, 2021 versus $1,264,337 for the three-month period ended March 31, 2020. This can be attributed to government-funded Covid-19 related support of $244,931 received in the three-month period of 2021.
-Quarterly Non-IFRS Adjusted EBITDA was $(416,969) versus $(903,424) in Q1 2020 resulting from higher revenue and resulting increased gross margin of $674,029 in the current quarter, compared to the same quarter of 2020.

Outlook
-Our strong Q1 2021 result was the best quarter ever for the Company and followed a solid Q4 2020, thereby setting up a strong foundation for 2021 and beyond. Clear Blue supported deployments by three key telecom accounts, all of whom have plans for large multi-year initiatives supporting Tier 1 global telecom providers. The Company’s recurring revenue increased by 53%, with new bookings and related deferred revenue growing by 179% and 100%, respectively, over 2020.


I'm bullish on this one, and have a small position that I've held for about a month. They just started trading on OTCQB last month. Small market cap but it looks like they will see solid growth.",nm8nkz,$CBUTF Clear Blue Technologies - Q1 Financial Results

Regarding breaking $1 - I'm not sure it will do that this year without the reverse split. That would give them a market cap of over $500m which is a little high for a company doing $40m revenue. However, the CEO stated yesterday they're targeting $80m annual revenue within 24 months. That is when factoring in identified acquisitions they can make after raising capital as part of the NASDAQ uplist.

  
They \*should\* be trading at around $.20 now as even that price sees them trading at less than 3x their revenue.

WAKEFIELD, MA – May 27, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) Innovation Pharmaceuticals (OTCQB:IPIX) (“the Company”), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company, today announces that patient enrollment in the Company’s 120-patient, Phase 2 clinical trial of Brilacidin for COVID-19 has reached 90 percent and that the Company anticipates full enrollment to be completed in approximately two weeks.

Innovation Pharma is developing Brilacidin for treatment of moderate-to-severe COVID-19 in hospitalized patients under U.S. FDA Fast Track designation (see [NCT04784897](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04784897)). The Phase 2 study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating Brilacidin, a synthetic, non-peptidic small molecule drug candidate in a new class of compounds called defensin-mimetics, at domestic and international sites.

The Company intends to provide an update to shareholders upon the final patients entering the trial.

**About Brilacidin and COVID-19**

Brilacidin is the only non-peptidic defensin-mimetic drug candidate currently in a clinical trial as a treatment for SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus responsible for COVID-19. Additionally, Brilacidin has shown potent and consistent inhibition *in vitro* against coronaviruses, alphaviruses and bunyaviruses (with lab testing against other viruses also underway), supporting Brilacidin’s potential to be developed as a broad spectrum antiviral. The annual global antiviral drug market is [estimated](https://www.medgadget.com/2021/03/antiviral-drugs-market-2021-size-growth-share-trends-demand-merger-covid-19-impact-analysis-key-players-statistics-competitive-landscape-regional-outlook-and-global-industry-forecast-to-2.html) to reach $44 billion by 2026.

A peer-reviewed article in *Viruses* supporting Brilacidin’s COVID-19 treatment potential can be accessed at the link below.

This company has been promoted pretty regularly around here by some very suspicious accounts. Aside from a number of red flags (paying minor celebrities to promote their stock, pretending to be involved in water charity in Africa), their supposed business model was clearly criminal - intending to manufacture illegal drugs, creating a cryptocurrency whose stated purpose was to facilitate illegal transactions (buying their illegal drugs).

I made quite a few posts setting out these facts and was usually met with negative reactions. Hopefully everyone got out safely and takes some lessons from this - if it looks like a scam, it probably is. And for goodness sake, if the company is telling you they're going to commit a crime, don't invest.",nm982h,Minerco ($MINE) finally suspended by SEC

Most of the time they will only exercise them if they are in the money since otherwise it is cheaper to buy at market. It does provide an incentive though to work on getting the company value over the exercise price though as it is one of the primary ways small companies pay their management team. All goes well the exercise for the shares provides some additional cash to the company and compensates the staff. There are a lot of people that see it as dilution which it is but it allows the companies to focus on their projects rather than diverting cash to salaries which arguably is much more valuable than any dilution the relatively small percentage of shares allocated to compensation.

To go along with them I have some Cruz Cobalt $BKPTF simply because they share some board members with Spearmint and a bordering property in the Clayton valley. They have been nothing but down since I bought, but have been holding this bottom for a couple months now so might be a good time to buy in (or in my case average down).

**BC Craft Supply Co (CSE: CRFT)** is a diversified life-science company advancing cannabinoid and psychedelic innovation and psychotherapy. 

The company’s operations include:

* **BC CRAFT -**  a curator and aggregator of craft cannabis, providing advocacy and access for premium small-batch growers to Canada’s cannabis market;
* **MEDCANN HEALTH PRODUCTS LTD -** a cultivation and processing facility in Chemainus BC, currently undergoing a $2M renovation to access both Canadian medical and recreational cannabis markets
* **FEEL WELL BRANDS -** a successful cannabinoid brand house licensed in the state of California; and
* **AVA PATHWAYS -** a pre-clinical biotech company focused on neuroplasticity and mental health applications using psilocybin and other compounds derived from mushrooms.

CRFT works with local artisans in cross-sector and remains fervently committed to keeping the art, technique, and purity of their pursuit. 

&#x200B;

***BC CRAFT SUPPLY CO:***

**BC CRAFT** are social entrepreneurs and change agents, committed to transitioning legacy cannabis operators into Canada’s legal markets through operational support from seed to sale.  

BC CRAFT is the voice of craft cannabis on both sides of the aisle, fighting for fair access and representation of the most premium and well-known legacy cultivars and brands.  The team is ambitious and persistent, tackling major social issues and offering new ideas for wide-scale change.  

Our flagship legacy cannabis brand, *Grizzlers* ™ was recently launched into the Alberta market to widespread acclaim, with a very strong first order of over 27,000 units.  Offering access to premium cannabis brands at an incredible value - the company has partnered with AHLOT and SAFARI to expand distribution into major Canadian markets of Ontario, BC, and Quebec. 

BC CRAFT also boasts the return to the market for coveted health and beauty brand *Earth Dragon Organics* \- one of the most well-known cannabinoid beauty brands in the industry.   Earth Dragon remains incredibly popular on social channels and will be launched in the back half of 2021.  The IP from this early acquisition is fueling R&D in our future wellness lines in the United States. 

BC CRAFT’s subsidiary, Medcann Health Products Ltd., is a Health Canada licensed cultivator and processor with a license to sell cannabis products in the Canadian medical market.  Medcann is nearing Phase 1 completion of upgrades to their Chemainus facility; a $2M reconstruction in partnership with Jordache Commodities. 

Facility improvements will open medical sales revenue for the company, as well as in-house manufacturing and processing; allowing for a higher level of integration and autonomy across business units.  

With expected tolling revenue anticipated in late Summer 2021, and an impending sales license amendment that allows recreational sales in Canada, BC Craft Supply Co is uniquely positioned to be the preeminent craft aggregator in the Canadian cannabis market.

***FEELWELL BRANDS***

Somo Industries Inc (DBA Feelwell Brands) is a holding company incorporated in the province of  British Columbia, with a unique capital structure allowing the company to hold any number of licensed cannabis portfolio investments in the United States.  The company also controls the IP over brands, assets, technologies, recipes, and SOPs for various premium consumer packaged goods in the United States.  The acquisition provides accretion for investors, as it represents a proven pathway to growth, via access to one of the most lucrative cannabis markets in the world.

ClixTM, Feelwell’s first portfolio brand, is focused on bringing wellness-inspired, micro-dosed, dispensed cannabis to the USA’s largest cannabis market, California.  The brand is fueled and driven by local craft artists in the market and has a network of influence beyond social media which it plans to leverage to fuel further growth.  Clix has two primary products for sale in California; herbal blended pre-rolls, and novel herbal blended micro-dosed tablets.

With dozens of product formulations and innovation in the IP pipeline, CLIX has the capacity to launch into various verticals and channels in the United States at rapid pace.  The company plans to launch Herbal Blended Flower Sticks in addition to Hot Drink Elixirs this Summer with significant distribution planned later in the year.    

&#x200B;

***AVA PATHWAYS***

**AVA Pathways** is a life sciences company leveraging a strong pre-clinical and clinical experimental program to drive the next generation of psychiatric medicine using psychedelic compounds derived from mushrooms.

Through evidence-based research, the Company is a global leader in developing new psychoactive therapies to accelerate patient access.  AVA’s safe and effective psychedelic compounds, coupled with novel formulation and protocol IP aim to redefine the future of psychotherapy.

For example, in my head I know that I should take good care of my body, or put more effort into relationships that I care about etc. but many of us let life's distractions get in the way. When these topics cross your mind on psychedelics, the feelings of wanting to improve these certain areas of your life (as well as most feelings) are amplified X1000. All the little excuses you use to rationalize not doing them disappear, and you know in your soul that you can and will do better and can't believe you were so indifferent about whatever it is previously.

For me its not usually that I'm confronted by some ground breaking revelation that I had never realized before (though this can happen as well), but more that it almost forces you to think about issues in your life with emotion/feeling/energy so intense that it tends to stick with you even after the trip is over. 

Sure, some people do everything great and don't need the kick that psychedelics can give you, but many in todays world are often numbing/excusing/procrastinating their problems away to some degree, and this intense burst of emotional energy can sort of snap you back to what is important.",,

&#x200B;

**What have they achieved so far?**

&#x200B;

**5 IP of note undergoing testing or underway at this time.**

**Antiviral/Antibiotic/Antifungal ZENGuard ™:**

Has strong purported reliability against drug-resistant [disease](https://www.zengraphene.com/zen-graphene-solutions-announces-successful-testing-of-its-graphene-compound-against-antimicrobial-resistant-bacteria/). Functionality presents itself in the form of coatings for PPE in partnership with TreborRx of masks, mask filters and nitrile gloves. Phase 1 human trial testing of similar compound for pharmaceutical use case may begin sometime in the [fall](https://www.zengraphene.com/zen-graphene-solutions-announces-ingestion-good-laboratory-practice-study-for-its-graphene-based-compound/)**.** Through NucroTechnics they have confirmed that exposure of their compound does not lead to any irritation or [sensitivity](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/zen-graphene-solutions-announces-initial-phase-2-cytotoxicity-results-for-its). Minimum concentration < 1µg/ml to achieve 99.9% effectiveness. 

**Graphene-Enhanced Concrete:**

40% higher compressive and flexural strength at a 0.02% concentration of graphene, 84% at a 0.04% [concentration](https://www.zengraphene.com/graphene-derived-from-albany-graphite-continues-to-show-considerable-promise-as-cement-additive/).

**Graphene-Carbon Aerogel Batteries:**

Very exciting results through the German Aerospace Centre. 2 wt.% loading of graphene dispersed in aerogel and resulted in an initial specific discharge capacity of 2800 mAh/g and a discharge capacity of 1300 mAh/g after 50 cycles at a current [capacity of 186 mA/g](https://www.zengraphene.com/zen-graphene-solutions-announces-new-research-collaboration-agreement-on-carbon-aerogels-with-german-aerospace-center/). A [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1PKuHasAGI8z5SY7eH18ZN?si=c3cdbbf13a5c45bd)(Nov '19) with Francis Dube suggests further developments on this technology should see light within the next year (at the time it was suggested a 2 year minimum).

**Dehumidification Membranes:**

Through a partnership with Evercloak. Increases power efficiency of HVAC systems by [\~75%](https://www.zengraphene.com/royal-canadian-navy-partners-with-zen-graphene-and-evercloak-to-test-graphene-oxide-dehumidification-membrane-technology/).

**Corrosion Protection Coatings:**

Testing shows improved wear resistance, extend engine life, increase fuel efficiency, and increased engine power in vehicles. Epoxy corrosion-inhibiting coating for steel showed minimal corrosion (3% of surface) after 10 days when exposed to highly corrosive saline solution. Two-year project studying graphene as a corrosion protective [coating for steel](https://www.zengraphene.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2021-05-ZEN-Company-Presentation.pdf).

**Maths! Earnings!** Numbers provided on ZENS' Investor presentation, **I'm filling the gaps**.

Coating volume once ramped up (currently pilot stage) will be \~800million coated units per month \~2.4 billion per quarter. Earnings per unit provides **$0.03-$0.06** cents per unit giving **$2.19-$4.38 EPS** for 99,000,000 diluted shares with 24% corporate tax rate. This provides fair **2-3 year** **SP range of $30-$60** at full production capacity (upper end wont occur until we collapse our cost structure to enhance the unit margins).

Glove coatings at **$0.01-$0.04** per unit would add around **+$0.30-$1.20 EPS**, HVAC filters with coating at **$1.00-$4.00** per unit would provide **+$0.08-$0.30 EPS**. This adds onto the **max** 2-3 year SP range by **$5-$18 result in $35 - $70** on earnings from combined PPE & HVAC market penetration. We are currently expected to be at 32 million coatings per month by end of June. That is an annual rate of 384 million disregarding the ramping-up, providing **by June a floor EPS \~0.11 Justifying minimum of $4** if current extrinsic share price is allotted. November is when full production is expected. At least a full year or two will be required to prove earnings, stabilizing intrinsic share price.

A similar material to ZENGuard**™** is being tested toward [therapeutic usage](https://www.zengraphene.com/zen-graphene-solutions-announces-ingestion-good-laboratory-practice-study-for-its-graphene-based-compound/) within the human body. Therapeutic would disrupt portions of a massive industry so it's hard to take into account. We will see resistance from this sector, so do not expect this to happen quietly or easily. Controversy is likely if this portion is a success. This is where the true speculative value of ZGS will be. If they can pull off ZENGuard™ they can redouble toward therapeutic and disrupt sectors of pharmaceuticals that have poor adaptability.

It kills superbugs, partially solving a present and future problem. Bacteria/viruses/fungi can't really adapt out of silver. It destroys the cells by lysis, so, if adopted, we may not see the problem we've seen caused by the overuse of antibiotics. Human/animal cells have more and thicker membranes, protecting them from lytic destruction. DNA I'm not too sure the effects toward, but should be minimal if any. Testing will confirm and is ongoing.

**Great!.. What are we waiting for?**

A [health advisory](https://www.healthycanadians.gc.ca/recall-alert-rappel-avis/hc-sc/2021/75309a-eng.php) published April 2nd by Health Canada brought to light a series of unwarranted masks which were introduced into the markets late last spring, as to take advantage of the Covid-19 virus without safety testing or certification. These masks allegedly contained Graphene, causing a obvious holdup for our graphene-based coating for masks. Further info has been sent to HC and secondary testing is now underway & awaiting results.

Bantrel, an engineering firm, is working with ZEN to establish a pipeline for producing ZENGuard coating material, while configurable for other use. ZEN remains on course to produce \~32 million by June approximately.

The major problem thus far with graphene markets, isn't about creating the tech, it has been about showing and exposing people to how effective small amounts of graphene are in improving already existing products. It's been shown that Graphene is a great additive for many applications, and provides [**large efficiency bonuses**](https://eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-05/uom-ips051821.php) **from small % addition**, but many IP needs introduction to market or to create the markets. ZEN has done very well with getting reach arounds from companies; Board has alluded to other PPE + Filtration manufacturers expressing interest so keep posted. TreborRx has an **LOI** agreement to collaborate on a minimum 100,000,000 masks so it is not an expressly permanent agreement by any means.

They are sitting on $4mil cash from previous offering. Cash burn of \~1.5mil per quarter while setting up production infrastructure. Either **expect success out of ZENGuard™** or **be ready for a little more dilution/warrants**.

**Closing Statements & Comments:**

Some may be worried ZENGuard ™ is only a good product for corona but this is a product with no competition, it is an application to already existing products. Better PPE would only benefit everyone in the future IMO, plus that isn't its only application given it is a coating.

This could be the beginning of something great, don't get too caught up in day-day movements, this could easily take months to move significantly so if you don't have patience this company might not be the right pick. Much news to come! Patience is key if you know what's coming.

Thank you for your time when reading and taking this innovative company into consideration. Evercloak and TreborRx, the partners of ZEN will provide great stories for scientific progress through future as well.

579,gznlboq,2021-05-27 16:46:16,t1_gznlboq,t1_gznbd0o,pennystocks,"Royalties are paid as a distribution. However you are allowed to take depreciation on the wells as a tax deduction.

The distributions are considered ordinary income and taxed at your marginal rate. You can calculate the depletion ratio on PBT and similar royalty sites but let's assume you invested 100k in July 2020 and sold end of year. Your depletion write down would be roughly $2200 as a deduction on your tax return to offset the marginal rate.

However that's not typically why funds purchase the royalty, they purchase it for the short term high yield return on the royalty payment. This can be seen today with the price being slightly down on ex-div date which is normal for a slight selloff on that date for any equity that pays a dividend or royalty and new buyers come in and sellers allocate. I am also not playing the equity for a long term monthly distribution payment but instead allowing the monthly payment yield to pop and the underlying equity to rise so that I can sell my stake to a buyer looking to capture that higher dividend in Aug-Sept. I do plan to hold some shares long term for the distribution payments but it will be equal or less than my profit on the shares as I move to rebalance and allocate my capital to other holdings.",,

The Mod Team would like to announce that we are joining the [r/predictor](https://www.reddit.com/r/predictor/) club Over the next few weeks you will begin to see regular Prediction post that will allow you to wager points to climb up the leaderboard The first tournament will begin ......Now and end Monday the first and will be a S&P 500 Monday Green or Red Close  ?

a bit more about Predictor

“Prediction Tournaments.” Prediction Tournaments are contests that have a collection of predictions tied to one event. Some other updates:

* **Prediction Tournaments don’t require Coins.** At the beginning of a Tournament, every predictor will start with 1,000 “Tokens” to play with; these are different from Coins, and are not purchasable. You can only use the Tokens you’re given, or that you earn during tournament play. So make those predictions count!
* **Mods can create Tournaments.** Mods can create the Predictions, name the Tournaments, select the correct answers and end the Tournaments. (So basically, they can run tournaments without help from a Reddit admin.) Mods can also host as many Tournaments as they’d like, but there can only be one live Tournament in a community at a time.
* **Each Tournament has its own leaderboard.** Each community will have its own Tournament leaderboard, and when that Tournament ends your place will be preserved in Tournament history. If a community starts another Tournament, you can start fresh and earn your way to first place in a brand-new leaderboard! (Leaderboards will live in a dedicated “Predictions” tab in the community.)

637,,2021-05-27 17:16:07,t3_nmcdo1,,pennystocks,"  GREAT ATLANTIC RESOURCES CORP.  has begun the 2021 exploration program at its Golden Promise Gold Property, located in the central Newfoundland gold belt. Exploration is underway in the northern region of the property to define trenching and drilling targets. Two rock samples collected by the Company during 2017 from quartz float in this region returned 57.5 and 200 grams / tonne gold (Company News Release of August 28, 2017). This is referred to as the Branden float occurrence.  
Great Atlantic is currently conducting prospecting and rock / soil geochemical sampling in the area of the Branden float occurrence. Following this work, the Company will continue the 2021 exploration program on multiple target areas throughout the property. Planned work consists of prospecting, rock / soil geochemical sampling, geophysical surveys, trenching and diamond drilling. The Company is preparing trenching and diamond drilling permit applications for priority areas including the Jaclyn Zone, the Otter Brook gold showing and a zone of gold soil geochemical anomalies within the southwest region of the property.  
The Golden Promise Property is located within a region of recent significant gold discoveries. The property is located within the Exploits Subzone of the Newfoundland Dunnage Zone. Within the Exploits Subzone, the property lies along the north-northwestern fringe of the Victoria Lake Supergroup (VLSG), a volcano-sedimentary terrane. The northwestern margin of the Golden Promise Property occurs proximal to, and, in part, contiguous with a major (Appalachian-scale) collisional boundary, and suture zone, known as the RIL. The RIL forms the western boundary of the Exploits Subzone. In my opinion potentian yeilds from deposits that are expected to be found during GPGP Project may push $GR price back to levels of 2017-2018. All depends on the news of how succesful this project will turn out to be.

News from today... 

Following the successful premiere of Stan Lee’s Super Hero Kindergarten, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, on Kartoon Channel!, Genius Brands International, Inc. (“Genius Brands”) (NASDAQ:GNUS), continues to grow its content offering with the acquisition of proven hit series from award-winning third party producers.Since launching in June 2020, Kartoon Channel!, which is now widely available and fully distributed in the U.S. across all platforms, has significantly expanded its catalog of original and third-party programming. On April 23, 2021, Genius Brands launched its first Kartoon Channel! original, Stan Lee’s Superhero Kindergarten, which has since garnered over 22 million views, making it one of the fastest growing children’s series today.The new content acquisitions for Kartoon Channel! include classic evergreen and new popular series and feature films. From WildBrain, Genius Brands has licensed the rights to Super Mario Bros. (13×30’); Adventures of Paddington Bear (13×30’). Trollz (27×30’); Madeline (13×30’); and Liberty’s Kids (40×30’).

Jon Ollwerther, President of Kartoon Channel, and EVP of Business Development of Genius Brands commented: “We are continuing to grow Kartoon Channel! each month, with more and more viewers enjoying what we believe is the very best combination of original, exclusive, and acquired content in the kid’s entertainment industry, including our hit Stan Lee’s Superhero Kindergarten, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Market Action

As of 12:03, GNUS stock is trading up by 3.01% to $1.71. The stock has witnessed a total volume with 4.22 million shares, compared to its average volume of 26.38 million. The stock has moved within a range of $1.6800 – 1.7500 after opening the trade at $1.72.



Older but still great info...


GNUS stock primarily benefits from what the underlying company calls “content with a purpose.” What this translates to is “edutainment,” or entertaining children with cartoon characters while teaching them valuable life lessons.

Here, Genius Brands does offer an intriguing narrative. It levers the intellectual property of Stan Lee outside of his Marvel Comics universe. As well, notable celebrities like Arnold Schwarzenegger lends his voice and support for Genius content.

Even more bullish for GNUS stock, the novel coronavirus pandemic essentially gave the underlying company a hostage audience. As you might expect, screen time for kids increased dramatically. With so many parents worried about their young ones being influenced by the wrong content, Genius Brands offers an extremely compelling solution.",nmcm5l,$Gnus is actually becoming legit (seriously) news covering today on some numbers. Viewership is great amd content is actually good.

Shell companies often have large amounts of authorized shares to avoid hostile takeovers, then sell those shares to the company they're doing the merger with. In this case, Hempacco is coming in and has already said no plans for dilution (meaning moving those authorized shares to outstanding shares) for at least a year (and at that point, to use for acquisitions), and in fact announced they will buy back 300 million shares (remove them from the outstanding float). 

So when the details of the reverse merger were announced, and were perfectly normal by any other OTC reverse merger standards, people who obviously have no idea what they're doing heard 75 billion shares and panick sold. 

I'm always amazed at the amount of people trading in the OTC that have no clue how any of these things work. Anyhow, it's on sale and nothing that made people start buying in the first place has changed, so it's a good time to get in.",,

1) Al batteries have been known, as well as their ability to be fast charged in a laboratory environment. So much of their statements are already known.
2) In my brief search it is unclear if they will be able to scale it from the bench to production. As with batteries with solid electrolytes, e.g. QS, many companies claimed to have made breakthroughs only to back track wlonce they determined it is much more difficult to scale at manufacturing levels. 
3) Al batteries in the laboratory typically have much shorter life cycles, the number of times they can charge and recharge the batteries. I didn't see any explanation of how they overcame this beyond a conclusory statement that it is comparable to Li. 
4) There are no details regarding what they use for the cathode or the electrolyte. These are what determine energy density, life cycles, heating during charging, etc.

The Mod Team would like to announce that we are joining the [r/predictor](https://www.reddit.com/r/predictor/) club Over the next few weeks you will begin to see regular Prediction post that will allow you to wager points to climb up the leaderboard The first tournament will begin .her Follow this link Below [https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/nmcqdt/which\_one\_of\_these\_stocks\_will\_have\_the\_highest/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/nmcqdt/which_one_of_these_stocks_will_have_the_highest/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

a bit more about Predictor

“Prediction Tournaments.” Prediction Tournaments are contests that have a collection of predictions tied to one event. Some other updates:

* **Prediction Tournaments don’t require Coins.** At the beginning of a Tournament, every predictor will start with 1,000 “Tokens” to play with; these are different from Coins, and are not purchasable. You can only use the Tokens you’re given, or that you earn during tournament play. So make those predictions count!
* **Mods can create Tournaments.** Mods can create the Predictions, name the Tournaments, select the correct answers and end the Tournaments. (So basically, they can run tournaments without help from a Reddit admin.) Mods can also host as many Tournaments as they’d like, but there can only be one live Tournament in a community at a time.
* **Each Tournament has its own leaderboard.** Each community will have its own Tournament leaderboard, and when that Tournament ends your place will be preserved in Tournament history. If a community starts another Tournament, you can start fresh and earn your way to first place in a brand-new leaderboard! (Leaderboards will live in a dedicated “Predictions” tab in the community.)

As part of the work, a direct lithium extraction (""DLE"") technology from Chemionex is also being tested. Cypress is seeking to secure an option to license Chemionex's proprietary Lionex DLE technology for commercial use at its Clayton Valley lithium project.

The plant at the Amargosa Valley site will be divided into three main sections. 

The initial focus of the pilot plant operation will be on chloride-based leaching to confirm previously reported results. 

In the leach area, work will be done to optimise leach conditions and confirm lithium extraction in the enriched leach solution. 

In the in the tailings handling section, different variants will be tested through to determine material processing, moisture content and water consumption.

The work carried out by NORAM Engineering will treat the concentrated lithium solution from the DLE area of the pilot plant to produce lithium hydroxide and test the separated leach solution for compatibility when returned to the leach area of the plant.

With all of the nonsense and garbage in the OTC these days (especially on Twitter with the FinTwit pumpers...you know who they are) Reddit seems to be the only place to get good information about companies with solid foundations, business plans, and low floats. It seems the FinTwit community would rather invest in something at 0.001 with tens of billions of shares in the structure than in something that is already at 0.05 with low float, catalysts, and actual business operations.

Personally, I am holding the following low floats at the moment and here's why:

\- AXTG - Pink Current - Reverse Merger in play with William Tien appointed as the new CEO. Tien is the founder of TiENPAY, a cryptocurrency and blockchain payment system and is a big name in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Australia with a vision of bringing his technology to North America. 20M in the float, sitting in and around 0.04.

\- GEVI - Pink in process - This one is a bit speculative. They are an entertainment venture who is working on new management with the bringing on of a ""grammy award winning artist"" (not released yet) and their record label which currently houses 12 other acts. Latest PR also speaks to the development of NFTs for the artist and label. 7-11M in the float, sitting around 0.18.

It looks like the research they conducting involving the sepsis treatment through macrophage Polarisation is good enough. It has a lot of potential, especially because the direct cause of death in covid cases are due to sepsis that results from uncontrolled cytokine storm. This was published last year, so if they have gone so far as to enter clinical phase, I would certainly invest in THEIR stock, but it may be rather far in the future until they can actually implement the method. As for psilocybin, I’m still not sure. Because the research article is a very specific protein structure that they are dealing with. It is not some substance they can extract from mushrooms. They actually design it specifically. Otherwise, they lose the ground for application altogether. Investors need more convincing link between psilocybin and the sepsis treatment or treatment for other diseases if you want them to invest. But if you like the shrooms why not buy their stocks. By all means yes. I’m personally  not a fan of mind altering substances.",,

While I have some pennies that I really believe are strong companies that will eventually make me good profits, the biggest mistake I made was holding after a stock had risen over 100% because I believed in it only to watch it tank. It's really hard not to chase things that are running or to believe in the excitement. A quick search of the stocks you mentioned shows many headlines full of hyperbole and I have to say the one about not caring about the lawsuit or the shorts should have at least raised an eyebrow.

Expected to be drilling any day now. This looks to be an exploration company at the start of their program which means the price is now low and will move on the work and in anticipation of results. This will go higher over the next 6 weeks or so and if they get some good results it will be much higher. This is the project deck if you want more info.

1000,gzoux7x,2021-05-27 22:15:20,t1_gzoux7x,t3_nmgwj9,pennystocks,"I would start doing more DD on the companies you are looking at. First glance should probably be a 1 year chart so you can see if the companies have already run way up.  CSLI for example has lived below 1 cent for most of the last 5 years and it is probably going back. MAXD has the same pattern with just a lower price. GRNH looks better but still is 5x the price it has been at for most of the year. When you see penny stocks that are in positions like that they likely are going back down unless they have a some fundamental changes to their business that would justify the increases. 

Another thing to keep in mind, depending on when you bought, these micro stocks were all running on volume but since February virtually all the micro caps have been drifting down. Lower volume and no real business models means you are going to lose money. That seems to be turning around a bit but you definitely want to look closer and see if these companies have any value. Add more time to your DD. You spend a lot of time earning the cash you are investing so at least take a decent amount of time digging on tickers to weed out the scammy ones that are probably going to go down. 

Lastly, if you see a stock that is being pumped by a lot of people, you probably have already missed the run but this is also when you want to vet the information yourself. Don't just trust the poster and confirm details yourself. It should only take about 10 minutes to blow off questionable tickers and if they get past the initial check then definitely dig deeper to see if you can see news or other catalysts coming that will move the stock. If you do, then consider investing. 

You can expect a lot of bad decisions until you get more experienced. Just work at it and it will get better. There rarely is a reason to rush into any stock so if you see it has already moved up a lot, take more time to see if you should buy it. You probably wanted to be in before it moved as in penny stocks a lot are just pumps with no value.",,
