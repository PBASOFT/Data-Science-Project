The algorithm is generic and could theoretically be used for any asset class, but my suspicion is that it would be most profitable in cryptocurrency. For crypto I'm considering BlockFi, Binance and/or Robinhood, but none of them are checking all of the boxes for me. Outside of that realm I haven't done a lot of research and obviously there are many, many options.

TL;DR: I'm looking for a platform where I can execute \~dozens of automated trades per day with low/no transaction fees. Any liquid asset class will work for this. Suggestions are highly appreciated.",nj27r4,What are good options for amateurs who want to do high-frequency trading?

Are you someone who wants to know about programming more generally and prefer structured lessons with an expert helping you along from the beginning? If so then find a python course on udemy or youtube and start following along.

Are you someone that just wants to know python thats specific to algotrading but still prefer structure? Then find an algo-specific course that shows you how to interact with your chosen broker/api.

Do you just want to jump in, and prefer learning only what you need? Then jump in, and be prepared to Google things frequently (and often using different terms until you become more fluent in the metalanguage specific to algotrading and python). 

We live in an age where all of these options are on eqyal footing - it's entirely up to you and which you believe will suit best.

For reference I fell into the third category. I know so.e basic c# stuff from using Unity, and have a good understanding of basic programming concepts such as variables, loops and if/else statements. Since I just wanted to get stuck into it, I found a basic tutorial on YouTube that showed how to use IB_Insync. I didn't watch the whole thing, just enough to get the basic idea and where I could find official documentation. 

From there it was a ton of googling. Seriously, so much googling! My first bot iteration took about a week to make, and I was able to have it running on paper trading all last week. 

I still have lots of tweaking and some quality of life additions to make, but at least that gives you a rough timescale for someone of my ability* with my preferred learning style. 

* I should also mention that I've been daytrading for a few months on my own, and so already knew what strategy I wanted to try and automate - I wrote it in psuedocode first (basically plain English) so all I had to do was learn how to implement exactly what I wanted to do. Don't ask me to explain the difference between a standard dictionary and a pandas dataframe - I have no idea!

I know tradingview pine script is flawed and limited, but I‚Äôm very early on in my algotrading journey and don‚Äôt know any python yet.

After 50-100 hours I‚Äôve come up with a strategy for BTCUSD. I think I‚Äôm on to something with it, backtesting suggests it profits both long and short no matter what direction BTC is trending in. It has pretty killer returns on a monthly basis with minimal drawdowns (and yes I‚Äôm including commission, spread, and slippage, but it could be a little overfit)

The thing is it has a Sharpe ratio of only 0.67

I‚Äôve tweaked the same strategy and applied it to SPY and EURUSD and I‚Äôm able to get a sharpe of about 1.3 but the returns vs drawdown are worse than my BTC version. I‚Äôve heard sharpe penalizes volatility in your favor, and sortino ratio can be better bc it doesn‚Äôt.

So I‚Äôd like to figure how to calculate sortino. Preferably not manually because I have about 1000 trades

Without further knowledge of that space, I would argue that the word ""amateur"" is not very compatible with ""high frequency"" anymore.

To answer your question, there are mainly 2 types of brokers. Those that charge you and those that don't charge you commissions. Those that don't - will most likely be selling your data to the real high frequency firms that will be able to front run your order any moment, any day of the week.

So, while creating an algorithm that bases itself on low profit margins and timeframes, you need to account for the fact that the slippage is most likely gonna be bigger than you might have calculated (or didn't calculate) and it might even turn out that paying the fees for transactions is better than paying the invisible fee of being front-runned

I operate with interactive brokers that are generally considered to have pretty good and fair order execution, but they do have transaction fees. 

I think it's up to you to calculate the real cost of your transactions in both cases and you'll most likely have to operate your algorithm live for a while to be able to know that.

And with such algorithms, you need to be absolutely sure with your calculations and your testing, as I can see you probably already inserted some biases in the development, judging by the ""depending on how I adjust the parameters"". Hope you are properly testing it with walk forward and monte carlo.

The algorithm was initially designed to find the most bullish coins on Binance and buy in as long as the increase in price continues. It's been great working on this for the past few weeks alongside other talented developers who have been improving upon the original code on GitHub. 

The project gathered significant attention from the GitHub dev community, and have helped to make significant improvements to the original codebase, and I thought you guys might like it as well. 

The code was built with customisability in mind, where each user can modify parameters like:

* Define what % increase constitues a buy signal
* Time elapsed between price checks
* Trailing stop loss / take profit
* Stop buying when the market is bearish

In addition to the core functionality, the algorithm is now able to receive and act on external signals which are fully customisable.

It uses data from Tradingview, and this returns buy signals according to the most relevant indicators. BY default if at least 18 out of 26 indicators agree that it's a good time to buy a certain coin, this will tell the bot to go buy that coin.

The bot also has a newly-implement pause functionality. It essentially analyses 15 moving average indicators and if half of them show that's a bearish market, the bot will not buy during this period.

You can also choose and pick any number of custom indicators from oscillators to moving averages and more. Those require a bit of coding, and I'm hoping to make it more user-friendly in the future but the core functionality is there.

The bot has a test mode that simulates live trades in real-market conditions so you can see how it performs without the risk of losing money. The project is still in the experimental phase, so it's quite early to determine its potential profitability.

If you're comfortable with Python and would like to inspect the source code please be my guest:

[https://github.com/CyberPunkMetalHead/Binance-volatility-trading-bot](https://github.com/CyberPunkMetalHead/Binance-volatility-trading-bot)

The only core functionality that is missing at the moment is a backtesting module, and I'm currently looking into that.

I like your approach of checking across all coin pairs. This is one of the biggest advantages of trading algorithmically, but chronically under-utilised (at least from what I‚Äôve seen on this sub).

Pausing the whole algo in a bearish market is great, I‚Äôve been missing something like this in my project so it‚Äôs cool to see how you‚Äôre determining it.

How are you implementing trailing stop-losses? Binance don‚Äôt offer ‚Äúnative‚Äù TSLs for Spot trading, so are you just cancelling and re-placing pending orders in response to price movements? That‚Äôs how I‚Äôve done it, it works reasonably well, but I wouldn‚Äôt mind a cleaner solution.

One thing worth exploring (when you have backtesting in place) is your stop-loss, I see on GitHub it‚Äôs at 3%. You may be surprised (I certainly was) to find algos like this, in a bull market, perform more efficiently when you remove the stop-loss entirely. If you can afford to keep a position open for a few days, this often works out better than setting a stop-loss at e.g. 50%, and *also* better than triggering too frequently (like at 3%). Certainly something worth playing with!

**The Binance API has a few quirks.** Their API documentation is OK, but could definitely do with some improvement. Make sure you read *the entire documentation*, as there are many ""gotcha"" caveats scattered throughout. You'll inevitably run in to a random API issue sooner or later, spend hours debugging, only to find the explanation is hidden in some changelog note from 2 years ago. Additionally, some fields in the API itself have typos, which will obviously be difficulty to change for backwards-compatibility. 

**They're not very receptive to community improvements.** Frustratingly, Binance's dev team seem a bit resistant to suggested improvements. There's plenty of documentation fix PRs on GitHub, correcting mistakes in their API docs, but Binance typically just reject or ignore them (despite being useful improvements). This is kinda frustrating as you lose faith in being able to trust their documentation.

**Don't use** `quoteOrderQty` **when placing orders.** You can place orders by specifying *either* a single `quoteOrderQty` field, or *both* `quantity` and `price` fields. I would always recommend using the `quantity` and `price` fields (where you specify a quantity of the *base* asset, and the price you would pay for it ‚Äî rather than the *amount* of the *quote* asset you're willing to spend to receive the base asset).

(This is just my opinion, there may be times when `quoteOrderQty` is advantageous, but I prefer to go the ""long way around"" as it reduces the risk of errors, makes accounting and finance easier, and ensures both buy and sell sides of a transaction are measured identically, making it much easier to track your performance.) 

**Postman is extremely helpful**. Import the [Binance Postman Collections](https://github.com/binance/binance-api-postman), it makes development and testing significantly easier!

**Use** `DECIMAL(24,8)` **data types for storing symbol snapshot values in an SQL database**. If you're storing volume for symbol snapshots, expect up to 16 figures before the decimal place. Ensure all price values are saved up to 8 decimal places too.

**Don't use** `float`**!** Use decimal/string values, in conjunction with a scientific math library, to ensure calculations are accurate when working with quirky crypto values.

**Each symbol has different order rules**. If you're trading across multiple symbols, you'll need to know the different symbol ""filters"". These filters are rules for each trade, and specify minimum quantities, minimum notional values, min/max percentage changes, and units of ""step size"".

**You should validate every order before placing it**. Binance has an endpoint at `/api/v3/order/test` ‚Äî use it! You can `POST` any order request to it, and it'll throw an error if the request fails any of the symbol or exchange filter rules. If it succeeds, you won't be charged, but know you're ready to place the order for real ‚Äî and are far less likely to encounter errors when you do so.

**POST/PATCH API calls can be kinda slow**. If you're trying to do *really* high-frequency trading, expect 1-3 seconds for an order to submit. Add more time if you validate the order first (recommended).

**Testnet data is really weird**. Don't expect Testnet data to be ""realistic"" in any way. You won't be able to run backtests on Testnet data, I think they just use a random number generator to create pseudo-random prices. There's also a much smaller range of symbols available than on the live exchange. Testnet data changes often and without notice, so whilst it's not at all useful for trading, it is good for weeding out unforeseen bugs in your code.

&#x200B;

It is a very powerful backtesting code. I found that you are able to perform backtests for multiple tickers, strategies and timeframes all at once. My God it can give an edge!

&#x200B;

So why am I writing here? This library is not popular at all, hence it has no community support, no one to ask an advice for (except for the developers themselves). I believe that with a larger community, this library could grow larger, become better and better.

&#x200B;

The big problem is the speed of Python (which is notoriously slow). With my decent computer, using 1MIN data, launching a backtest for 15MIN timeframe and using two indicators (one on 15MIN, other on 60MIN timeframes), I calculated that my computer would take about 20hours for the backtest of one year.

&#x200B;

Yes, pretty slow.

&#x200B;

On the other hands, the library has deleted a look-ahead bias, has commission models, slippage model, so with all that- it makes sense that it's so slow.

&#x200B;

Since I have started to know how to work with it- you can ask me about it, I'll try to answer and perhaps we will be a part of making the code better

I‚Äôd also add that when you‚Äôre trading on the minute scale, use limit orders and wait for them to fill, rather than market orders. That way you know exactly what price and quantity you‚Äôll be trading with.

If you‚Äôre using stop-losses in volatile conditions, even if it‚Äôs a stop-limit order, it can get skipped over if the price drops fast enough. I would set up a monitoring process to watch any pending stop-losses periodically, if the price drops below the stop price and the order didn‚Äôt trigger, bail out with a market sell (or set another lower limit, as you see fit).

45 trades a day sounds like a lot for one symbol, you‚Äôll be picking up a lot of noise in the data and likely trading too often. Not to say it‚Äôs not possible to make a profit, but I imagine your margins will be very tight, and you‚Äôd need a big budget. Higher order quantities mean harder fills. Perhaps consider setting your buy/sell indicators a little stricter so you trade less often, but more reliably. 

I‚Äôm speaking from experience here, I used to think ‚Äúmore buy signals = more profit‚Äù, but over time realised it was just bringing my strategy‚Äôs results closer to a coin toss, and masking where my true edge really was. Expect lots of trial and error, but be cautious of overfitting. And like everyone always says here, what works in a bull market might be completely different in a bear market.

You can use OCO orders if you want to simplify entering/exiting a position. Whilst OCOs can be useful, I personally found building my own trailing stop-loss implementation, combined with careful polling of my outstanding orders, to be more profitable.",,

\- The strategy is **backtested** only to the beginning of 2020, but I'm working on it. It's got an **annualized return of 26%** (compared to 16% for the SP500)

\- **Max drawdown** of -8.7% (thought this was pretty interesting - W\*B would be a very cool hedge for financial markets at large. Rode COVID like a wave)

\- **Sharpe Ratio**: 2.22. Here's an [investopedia link](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharperatio.asp) for those of you that can read

\- Profit-Loss ratio of 3.48.

\- Avg win of 0.85%

\- Avg loss of -0.24%. The fact that this number's absolute value is lower than average win is a good thing

You're stoked, you've finally finalized the final jupyter notebook document, it's 100% finalized and you don't have to edit another line--the time is now or never. ""All systems clear, we're ready for launch..."" reported mission control. Five minutes till market opens, and the sweat dripping off of your balls forms a puddle beneath your office chair.

Your head is spinning, the bot did horribly!

It hits you. Your strategy sucks ass. It doesn't work, and you realize you need to go back to the drawing board. You're also realizing that you started on the initial backtesting project over a year ago and that's where most of your time and effort was spent; you're questioning whether to even change your code because you're considering how long it would take to start backtesting a new strategy and then how long till you actually get to test this new strategy for real like you did today to see if it even works. You're so frustrated you grab a rock and smash your computer with it; the monitor falls off the desk and the screen cracks into a spiderweb manifesting every backtest you ever backtested, but in each shard of glass you can see a small window into your soul, a reflection of yourself in a parallel reality--a prehistoric caveman who backtested himself into a corner by his own fate.

&#x200B;

I know this is gospel wisdom in algorithmic trading circle, but I'd like to offer an alternative thought (please feel free to disagree with me).  


Signals should only be combined if they were developed in unison, and the low correlation between backtests might not be as significant as you think going forward. Any time I took a bunch of uncorrelated strategies and made a portfolio out of them, they ended up having high ""crash beta"" -- which is exactly what it sounds like.. i.e not good. Often times when they did hedge one another it was totally incidental and I couldn't rely on it.

&#x200B;

For me, nirvana only came when I started building signals in unison. Now all my strategies purposefully execute multiple trades simultaneously to reduce risk of any one trade.

268,gz88jda,2021-05-24 01:56:39,t1_gz88jda,t3_njlx75,algotrading,"FIX is a standardized protocol used in financial markets. Benefits include the ability to code up one FIX library which can then be easily adapted cross multiple counterparties with small tweaks. Generally there are standard tags (1=Account #) which further helps quick implementations. A framework exists for 'heart beats' to make sure connectivity is still active even without orders. Think about a fund who has 10s to 100s of connections / brokers and you can see how this quickly becomes useful.

In terms of speed - there won't be a clearcut answer on improvement as it would really depend upon the broker you're interacting with. Messages via both with proprietary API and FIX will likely need to be translated (ex: to exchange native). It's possible this is done more quickly on the FIX side because of less load on their servers, less hops, more optimized translation, etc. Anything actually latency sensitive would not use FIX; it's way too slow.

The $1,500 you are quoting would be for dedicated connectivity. It's likely more stable and potentially faster, but it's really dependent upon what you're doing and how the broker is setup. Ex: Connect in NJ.. maybe okay for US equities, but not so great for CME futures. 

At the 1min frequency the 300ms should not make or break the strategy. Also be thoughtful in how you're measuring your latency. Think about how delayed the data is when you get it, how long your message takes to get to the broker (acknowledged), how long the fill comes after the ack, your processing time, etc. You may find one of these steps is taking a lot longer than it should and can be easily fixed with less effort than porting to FIX.",,

Now let's talk about the trading algo itself. 

The philosophy is still following probability trading from TastyTrade, but we applied a couple of concepts of our own. 

The flow of the algorithm is as follows, 

1. Earnings Options Trades only, enter right before the Earnings to take advantage of max volatility. 

2. Find stocks with top performance in the last 2 years. (Rolling)

3. To qualify for our trading, it needs to stay above $30, only offer weekly options and have a winning percentage over 40%.

We used hedginglab.com API to achieve this step. 

Among all the options strategies, we picked Iron Condor for our first experiment. 

Candidates of the best performed stocks between 2019 to 2020 are: 

'CPRI', 'TIF', 'LEN', 'BUD', 'CSX', 'LMT', 'PNC', 'V', 'VZ', 'GD', 'JNJ', 'WHR', 'ZS', 'AMTD', 'GLW', 'OKE', 'CHWY', 'DAL', 'DPZ', 'HOG', 'SLB', 'TRIP', 'CNC', 'ABC', 'ADI', 'AKAM', 'AMT', 'BDX', 'BSX', 'CI', 'CME', 'CMG', 'CMI', 'CREE', 'CVNA', 'CYBR', 'EMR', 'FDX', 'GOOG', 'GS', 'HAS', 'HSY', 'LULU', 'MSFT', 'OLED', 'ORCL', 'OXY', 'PLAY', 'SAGE', 'SBUX'

Back testing is also done using Hedginglab.com API. Now we use the first quarter of 2021 to test earnings trades using those stocks. 

The loss of Iron Condor is limited and we can scale each of our trade to have a max of $2k loss.

Judging by your post, the chance that you meet these qualifications is not the best.

A few people have also fleeced newbies through various platforms into paying for systems that work on paper or past results, but aren't particularly sound. I guess that counts too.

Most people who have had success greatly exceeding the market and aren't profoundly talented are just lucky, or riding some current financial regime that will soon change. This will either blow up spectacularly or fizzle out. These aren't examples of being stable.

Stable success over long period above market returns isn't ordinary, and you have to be extremely talented to get it.

The market is highly motivated to be the hardest problem on the planet. It's very accessible and becomes a zero sum game around the market return. For every gain you make, you create a direct incentive for someone to disrupt that gain.

This application connects to MetaTrader 5 through its so works with any broker that supports MT5. It calculates the correlation coefficient between all pairs of symbols in the market watch, and monitors for divergence. 

The hypothesis is that once diverged, previously correlated symbol pairs will reconverted at some point. In order to turn this into a successful trading strategy, I need to work on:

* Which symbols are leading the divergence (I could trade both, but this eats into profit);
* Which direction to trade to take advantage of any re-convergence (this is easy manually when looking at the graphs but more difficult in the code);  and
* Which symbols to trade (count of times each symbol is leading a divergence in the same direction).

I plan to keep this open source, and if anyone wants to join this project and implement some of the above, happy to work together to see if we can make this into something.

As mentioned in the beginning, curious to know your thoughts on this. Do you think that would be useful or not really? Why? One reason I‚Äôm thinking it might be overkill is perhaps most tick-based strategies are backtested on small time periods, while it‚Äôs the buy-and-hold strategies that will be tested on the longer periods of time, meaning that the size of the backtest would be fairly small in either case.

A bit of background: I am software developer specializing in automating my clients‚Äô trading strategies with Interactive Brokers API in Python. I am not a professional trader, or even a hobbyist for that matter, which is why your opinions will be so valuable to me.

Recently I've been thinking about developing a backtesting framework based on \`ib\_insync\`, but leveraging Cython and C++ to get rid of the Python overhead as much as possible. 

In the first step, I am thinking of basically making a perfect copy of \`ib\_insync\` in C++ and exposing to Python with Cython. The goal would be to enable Python developers to write their code either in Cython or Python and be able to seamlessly switch between \`ib\_insync\` and this library. That way, you can write your code using \`ib\_insync\` to help with debugging (setting up Cython debugging is very complex), but you can then just switch to the Cython/C++ version with just one line of code in your \`main.py\`.

The next step would then be to implement Cython tools around that library that will help with backtesting. The idea is that you develop your code for live trading and then just run it with the backtesting harness without having to change your live-ready code at all (no work duplication and not having to maintain two versions). The advantage of this is, again, removing the Python overhead. The speed gain here will be important since, to achieve it, the backtesting will have to run a loop that feeds your algo the historical data candle by candle (or trade by trade) and there will be no vectorizing with \`numpy\`, all of which is extremely slow in Python.

The final step is build optimization algorithms (genetic algorithms, etc) that leverage all this functionality to optimize your algorithm‚Äôs parameters.

I've been thinking about this setup for some time, and I think I have the C components I will need to make this happen. For I/O, it‚Äôs possible to use the \[async POSIX.1b standard\]([https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html\_node/Asynchronous-I\_002fO.html](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Asynchronous-I_002fO.html)). And \[this little library\]([https://github.com/naasking/async.h/tree/master/async](https://github.com/naasking/async.h/tree/master/async)) mimics Python‚Äôs \`asyncio\`.

As mentioned in the beginning, curious to know your thoughts on this. Do you think that would be useful or not really? Why?

An Empirical Assessment""](https://jai.pm-research.com/content/23/2/162) published last fall in the Journal of Alternative Investments.

I am not a finance researcher so I can not speak to the credibility of the journal or the author, but the analysis the author presents for his claims seem credible enough from my layman's perspective (understandable, all models and sources used, etc.).

Main takeaways I had from the paper:

* No significant correlation between cryptocurrencies and other traditional asset classes on returns or volatility. 
   * Only significant correlation was with commodities like gold, on both volatility and risk. 
      * Share common features like a limited supply and their price being driven by aggregate demand and being seen as ""alternatives"" to traditional financial institutions.
* Negative, but not significant, correlation on volatility compared to other assets.
* Significant correlation between trading volume and returns occurring at the same time, as with assets like stock.
* Correlation between lagging returns (returns in the past) and trading volume, hence also future returns.
* Positive and significant correlation between trading volume and volatility (more trading --> more risk), but lagging volatility lead to less trading volume.
* Trading volume effected by both volatility and past returns, but more so the latter.

According to Robert Pardo's book `Walk-Forward Efficiency ratio = Out-Of-Sample value / In-Sample value` (also, the value should be annualized), but he does not specify how to calculate it over all runs in his book. At the moment, I'm using a median of the value (Sharpe ratio in my case), but I don't think it is correct from the statistical point of view.

How do I properly calculate a combined Walk-Forward Efficiency ratio for all passes?

The other was similar to what another commenter said about creating a rule based forward walk algorithmic that uses peak/valley detection and looks for Golden ratios between peaks/valleys that satisfy the EW rules.

The questions that came up were:
How much margin of error should be used when checking the ratios of segments of the wave?
What should the bounds be for the timescale?
How to make such a forward-walk rule based algo computationally efficient?

But it is possible to get day-end data, so the algo would use day end data or even hourly data to generate a signal. I know some institutions use each bid, ask and closeing as a data point for HFT, but that is not my short-term plan.

Well a bayesian approach would derive the mean, variance, and probability from past readings, something akin to the state transition matrix you might have used in Markov process. But with the bayesian approach, you could follow the dominant trend and use the variance bands as stochastic forces. Just like in Brownian motion where the force is a constant in random directions, with bayesian you could have a variable force and variable direction, the direction being a combination of dominant trend and force derived from past probabilities. It is a very high-level and a bit unformed concept and something similar to what I am working on for my thesis. The issue I see of applying this to crypto is the volatility of crypto the probability distribution of the 'force' is too wide. You can surely make profitable trades but not optimized trades.

How are you finding state transition matrix, is it a constant derived from past data or a variable for each current state, updated everytime?",,

Nbbo rules, orders are sold to internalizers not routed to market so you're getting a better execution compared to the DISPLAYED liquidity which is all that matters.

HFTs are incentivized to get the most order flow, they do this by providing the best price improvement to the broker.

Also, an inherent problem with RL is, it works optimally on known cases ie the data pattern or trend it has seen in the past. Which generally due to stochasticity wouldn't  be as optimal.

Another reason is the issue of the changin environment and action space choices.

Generally in RL the environment is stable meaning and the action choices has the same outcomes in almost all cases. In case of stock market when the agent moves to a new state the environment changes drastically, say if the stock is at all time high or has a very steep rise it wouldn't have optimal strategy then. In short, the movement of the agent would change the environment itself and consequently the rules of the environment. Also there is no guarantee that the learned strategy is an optimal one as everytime you train the strategy changes slightly and in a stochastic environment it can have a cascading effect.

790,,2021-05-25 19:24:11,t3_nkxtug,,algotrading,"Hello,

I hope everyone is having a great day today!  I've been pondering an issue, and I was wondering if there was some sort of convention, or what methods you all might have been successful with when it comes to averaging window size vs frequency of the underlying equity's movement.

So, nearly every algorithm that I've coded uses some form of averaging or measurement over a defined window (number of cycles 15 seconds, minute, hour, etc.).  When trading manually, I usually change these periods to match the current movement in the underlying that I'm trading.  Of course, what works best on one day, isn't what will work best at another point in time.  If you averages are too slow, and the frequency of the underlying moves faster, you end up slow to pull the trigger, and you buy high, and sell low.  When you are using to small of period, you can hop in and out of an otherwise great up trend =losing money.

For my bots, I usually manually adjust these until they are good, and then I use a series of nested for loops (Python) to run through all of the different combinations to tune the algorithm to the best performance.  Based on the time period you tune it over it makes a huge difference.  What works best over a five year period, might really suck it for months in a row, but make up for it during big run ups.  If you choose a bear cycle, it won't perform well for bull.  ...and on and on.

I usually choose a fairly short window to run my optimization (as outlined above), and do have the bot do this regularly and adjust.  My thoughts are that this keeps it in step with the current conditions. 

What I've been thinking about lately is to try and perform a Fourier Analysis to determine the strongest frequency of the underlying, and corelate the tuning with that.  I'm assuming that most every strategy uses time window based analysis at it's core, so this is something that should also plague and bot.  So what types of remediation do you guys use for accounting for this.  I guess you could just choose a steady equity with less chop, but for those who trade momentum on higher volatility equities, what have you found that works?

Thanks in advance for any conversation around this!  I really appreciate this community, and I love when there is good debate on techniques.

1. The time frame of the algorithm is critical. Their first major advance and first time they made money, was because the took their existing approach and changed from making long term predictions to making short-medium term predictions
2. Gathering as much data as possible and then developing algorithms that can leverage as much of that data that is useful, by combining the signals in some way. This implies to me a form of ensemble learning or possibly reinforcement learning, and having a really good way of estimating the accuracy and reliability of each signal
3. Effectively managing bet size as well as timing is critical
4. Knowing when to exit a position is critical, taking a profit or minimizing a loss
5. Cutting trading and execution costs to a minimum is very important. They outline how a bug in the code was costing them a tonne of money until it was removed by a new engineering hire, IIRC. Their edge per trade is tiny, so cutting costs while maintaining a large transaction volume is how they make a lot of their money.
6. Moving to a single underlying algorithm across different instruments allowed them to concentrate on making one really good model vs a number of mediocre ones.

825,,2021-05-18 03:53:07,t3_nf0hbd,,algotrading,"I have always been curious about game theory, but have been to intimidated to try to learn it. This week, I have decided to try and shake my fear and begin to learn about some basic principles in game theory:

I am looking at this basic problem in game theory that asks how should the owner of a company split the profits between her and her workers:

https://imgur.com/a/aDa5jiE

I am having some difficulty in understanding the notations:

1) "" Formally, a coalitional game is defined as: There is a set N (of n players) and a function and a function v that maps subsets of players to the real numbers: v : 2^N -> R , where v(""empty set"") = 0""

a ) Why does "" v : 2^N ""? Is the point of this expression to show all the possible interactions that can exist between any groups of players? 

b) When considering the ""value function"" (i.e. ""v"") , why does v (""empty set"") = 0? I guess this is an obvious statement, but is it supposed to mean that the potential value of the interaction between ""no players"" (i.e. the empty set) is ""0""?

2) Now, the problem where the owner of a company split the profits between her and her workers:

- The owner is represented by the symbol ""o""
- There are ""m"" number of workers (w1, w2, w3 ... wm)
- Each worker contributes an amount ""p"" to the profit

I am having difficulty understanding how the ""value function"" for this problem is determined:

The value function for the coalition of players (the coalition is denoted by ""S"") is:

- v(S) = mp, if the owner is included in the coalition 
- v(S) = 0, if the owner is not included in the coalition 

My question: How are v(S) = mp and v(S) = 0 initially determined? Or are these values assumed?

3) In this question, ""m"" is defined both as ""the number of workers"" as well as the cardinality of : S / {o} .

I have generally heard ""cardinality"" referred to as the ""size of a set"". What exactly does cardinality mean in this question? Are you supposed to be able to compute "" S / {o} ""? Why does ""S / {o}"" = m?

4) Can someone please walk me through the calculations? Why according to the Shapley values, should the profit be distributed such that: the owner receive ""mp/2"" and each worker receive ""p/2""? 

5) Lastly : Why is this question important? Is the point of this question to show ""the fairest distribution of profits according to contributions""?

Thanks

So far I had little success because of high fees and low price volatility. The main problem is that if I hold some asset for more than 30 seconds it becomes unreasonable because the bot itself cant see that far into the future.

I know that HFT is a thing but in my case its about 250ms latency so its not that.

So before I spend another 60hours on this, since I have little experience in finance I want to know: does trading high volatility stocks make sense on intervals 30sec or less, or the profit will not cover transaction fees and Im better off developing longer period strategies?

So far I did binance using real time orderbook data, 0.01% fees, +0.02% take profit and -0.1% stop loss. At best it went from 10k to 10k+8$ in a few minutes and then bought DOGECOIN and went to 10k-50$. Average scenario it looses about 1-2$ a minute (OMEGALUL). I can see some ways of improving it but I feel like Im trying to achieve smth which is not feasible without collocation and other serious HFT stuff.

I have already studied an elementary econometric course covering regression, multiple regression, binary, logit and probit etc, etc. In the next year or so I will  have the option to choose some more intermediate level to advanced econometric courses. I'm just wondering how applicable the models ill learn in econometrics are to issues outside the social science spectrum? That is, the application of econometric models to data for purposes of non-formal analysis, maybe even call it ""recreational analysis"". For example, i know that certain models when meeting certain conditions, can be applied to social science type issues/experiments, but what if i wanted to try leverage econometric modelling to perform analysis on more niche things such as sports (like is presented in moneyball for example) or even other games such as card games or stocks(though i know econometrics is already prevalent here).  I love finance and have an avid interest in statistics, stata and other programming languages, and want to deepen my statistical modelling capacity  beyond that of regressions, etc. I am really considering chasing this pathway, however, i am worried that the absence of applicability to anything outside of social science type experiments , in addition to a high focus on theoretical content over practical implementation will lead to growing boredom of the subject if i were to study it.  Hence, why i ask whether what i learn can be to at least some extent applied to recreational type ""experiments"", where my knowledge feels more tangible as i can actively apply what i have learnt to things that can be analysed with statistics and that are of interest to me, outside on my studies of course.",ne5v5k,Applicability of econometric modelling methods outside of usual social science applications?

843,,2021-05-18 03:53:07,t3_nf0hbd,,algotrading,"I have always been curious about game theory, but have been to intimidated to try to learn it. This week, I have decided to try and shake my fear and begin to learn about some basic principles in game theory:

I am looking at this basic problem in game theory that asks how should the owner of a company split the profits between her and her workers:

https://imgur.com/a/aDa5jiE

I am having some difficulty in understanding the notations:

1) "" Formally, a coalitional game is defined as: There is a set N (of n players) and a function and a function v that maps subsets of players to the real numbers: v : 2^N -> R , where v(""empty set"") = 0""

a ) Why does "" v : 2^N ""? Is the point of this expression to show all the possible interactions that can exist between any groups of players? 

b) When considering the ""value function"" (i.e. ""v"") , why does v (""empty set"") = 0? I guess this is an obvious statement, but is it supposed to mean that the potential value of the interaction between ""no players"" (i.e. the empty set) is ""0""?

2) Now, the problem where the owner of a company split the profits between her and her workers:

- The owner is represented by the symbol ""o""
- There are ""m"" number of workers (w1, w2, w3 ... wm)
- Each worker contributes an amount ""p"" to the profit

I am having difficulty understanding how the ""value function"" for this problem is determined:

The value function for the coalition of players (the coalition is denoted by ""S"") is:

- v(S) = mp, if the owner is included in the coalition 
- v(S) = 0, if the owner is not included in the coalition 

My question: How are v(S) = mp and v(S) = 0 initially determined? Or are these values assumed?

3) In this question, ""m"" is defined both as ""the number of workers"" as well as the cardinality of : S / {o} .

I have generally heard ""cardinality"" referred to as the ""size of a set"". What exactly does cardinality mean in this question? Are you supposed to be able to compute "" S / {o} ""? Why does ""S / {o}"" = m?

4) Can someone please walk me through the calculations? Why according to the Shapley values, should the profit be distributed such that: the owner receive ""mp/2"" and each worker receive ""p/2""? 

5) Lastly : Why is this question important? Is the point of this question to show ""the fairest distribution of profits according to contributions""?

Thanks

So far I had little success because of high fees and low price volatility. The main problem is that if I hold some asset for more than 30 seconds it becomes unreasonable because the bot itself cant see that far into the future.

I know that HFT is a thing but in my case its about 250ms latency so its not that.

So before I spend another 60hours on this, since I have little experience in finance I want to know: does trading high volatility stocks make sense on intervals 30sec or less, or the profit will not cover transaction fees and Im better off developing longer period strategies?

So far I did binance using real time orderbook data, 0.01% fees, +0.02% take profit and -0.1% stop loss. At best it went from 10k to 10k+8$ in a few minutes and then bought DOGECOIN and went to 10k-50$. Average scenario it looses about 1-2$ a minute (OMEGALUL). I can see some ways of improving it but I feel like Im trying to achieve smth which is not feasible without collocation and other serious HFT stuff.

I'm a programmer with about 15 years of experience and I've already written an application in C# that scrapes stocks and automatically places orders through an API. This all works well. The issue I'm experiencing is that I'm trying to make an intelligent machine that will make the decision to Buy, Sell, or Hold on every 1 second interval.

I've done a loooooot of research into ML the past three months and I'm currently using Google's Tensorflow to try and create an Agent that can do this. I'm having varying degrees of success

My first model was a modified DQN ( [https://github.com/benjamin-dupuis/DQN-snake](https://github.com/benjamin-dupuis/DQN-snake)) It was kind of close, but I just couldn't get a reliable sell to occur. It buys, and holds well, but the sell is unreliable.

I then discovered the Multi Armed Bandit model ([https://www.tensorflow.org/agents/tutorials/bandits\_tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/agents/tutorials/bandits_tutorial)) and that sounded a little bit closer. I used some of Googles samples to build an MAB using a couple of different types: Linear Stochastic and a Drifting Stochastic. Neither worked quite as well as I hoped either.

Has anyone had good experience with autotrading using a specific DQN or MAB model? I'm wondering if I'm expecting too much from machine learning...  

My features are AskPrice, BidePrice, Delta (change in Ask Price over last reading), IsInvested (1 or 0), Profit ( -1 if invested, else ranges from -1 to 1).  

I'm using both positive and negative rewards. It seems I get the most variance in my results when adjusting reward patterns.

https://www.quant-investing.com/blogs/general/2015/02/16/truths-about-stop-losses-that-nobody-wants-to-believe

This article suggests that a 20% stop loss is best to use, because the 5, 10, etc stop you out too soon. Lower stop-losses tend to offset and major losses in a short period, but over a long term they are wildly less profitable. I was curious if anyone else had found the same?

Here's my backtests:

Over 1,500 trades a 10% stop-loss would net me a 1.35% return (per 100% of my account traded).

Over the same 1,500 trades a 20% stop-loss would net me a 2.3% return (per 100% of my account traded).

Now, I'm not suggesting that 1,500 trades is a good back test. I would probably aim for a number closer to 10,000. However, the article tested this method over 85 years! Using my specific test as an example, I was very surprised to find such a wild difference in profit. I was curious if anyone else has had similar results? If so, why do you think this is?


Note: I only throw about 10% of my account at any single trade. So if a 20% stop loss did occur, it would be a 2% hit on my overall account which aligns with the following article:

The TDA API is also nice in that it supports option trading and is a good source of data for current option chains. However, the method used, get\_options\_chain, returns a JSON object that has a pretty complicated structure. It's a nested dictionary that mixes dicts and lists, where (at least) one of the lists has a single member that is a dict (at least that is how Python views it).

I really struggled to deal with it, and the only way I found to completely decompose it to (key, value) pairs was to use recursion. To save others the pain I went through, I created a GitHub repo with a couple of examples that will:

* Print out on your console every key/value pair in the get\_options\_chain JSON object
* Write the retrieved JSON object to a JSON file on your local machine.

We started with promising manual strategies and added more automation as we went along.

This algorithm monitors a few thousand symbols, mostly US and CA stocks and executes anywhere between 1-30 trades per day, almost every day but with more activity around quarterly reporting.

The strategy to generate the signals uses a few ML models trained on historical data over the past few years on data extracted from Thomson Reuters, as well as on our own proprietary formulas (in total, a few hundred features we deem most important are used in training).

For trade execution, we wrote our own software in .NET interfacing with IBKR. Machine learning is almost all Python.

For backtesting, we use QuantConnect as well as some in-house built software. This is mostly to try optimize certain parameters (entry/exit times, allocations, ...).

Here are the results from my actual IBKR account so far this year:

870,,2021-05-20 04:53:17,t3_ngr5jq,,algotrading,"Hi everyone,

for a grad level Machine Learning Class I recently completed, I built a decision tree to predict whether  a stock from the 30 companies in the DOW would return 0.5% or more by end of a week using the previous 6 weeks of data.

Our data was limited to the 2011 Q1 and Q2 Dataset, and just included Weekly stock price, volume, days to dividend, and % dividend. we trained on Q1 and tested on Q2.  We found our tree performed best using an RSI indicator, MACD indicator, Previous Week Price Change, previous 6 Week price change, days to dividend, and % dividend return.

Moving forward, despite overfitting with too many parameters being a constant theme that people warn about (with good reason I'm sure), I'd like to try building some huge trees/neural networks using just about as many attributes as possible and then start eliminating those that seem to do more harm than good.

Like before I will be choosing from the DOW, but I'll be incorporating other factors.  Previously my only live Algotrading has been with crypto, and frankly has been very frustrating.  I've learned how TA indicators really are just a little better than a coinflip, and there are much fewer attributes to incorporate with Cryptos as opposed to an actual stock in a company.  Hence why I'd like to try incorporating as many attributes as possible since I've felt really limited to just TA indicators with crypto trading.  

I've listed all the parameters I want to start pulling data for below, but please add any that I have not thought of.  Please feel free to give any advice on how to best apply these indicators (eg, how long of a moving average should I use for tracking Number of Mentions in Social Media? 2 days? Hourly? Weekly?....)  Also feel free to point out if any of my suggested attributes are particularly important or totally useless.  Thanks so much for any insight! It will save me countless hours working with data that winds up being completely useless

&#x200B;

Currently, the list of params I think I would be useful and want to incorporate:

1) Use of 2-3 Technical Indicators at Most 

 \-> This is probably my biggest concern.  From what I've read on here, using multiple TA to make a tree  or neural network is essentially just mutating the same data over and over again, which doesn't produce distinctly different attributes that will improve prediction accuracy

\->That being said, I would think 2-3 TA indicators can help establish a positive market trend , and define whether the trend is long or short term (eg 2 week avg is above 200 day avg, and a positive MACD, I would consider a valuable set of attributes that Stock is Bullish). 

2) P/E Ratio.  This an obvious useful tool for company fundamentals.  

3) Related Raw Materials Costs (e.g. my neighbor works at a Brewing Company and mentioned how high aluminum costs and no bars pouring drafts means more canning, which has been cutting into profits despite record sales)

4) Overall Market Trend (is DOW/S&P bearish or bullish)

5) Relationship to Similar Companies (e.g. is Coke lagging behind Pepsi? Do we expect Coke to Rise or Pepsi to Crash, or both?)

6) Scan internet for major News Outlet Mentions (e.g. Did Jim Cramer recommend on his show?)

7)  Sentiment Analysis and Popularity Growth from Reddit,Twitter (is it increasing or decreasing? Is sentiment mostly positive?)

8) VIX to incorporate risk due to volatility, help define higher/lower bail thresholds

9) Strike Prices and Expirations Dates of Puts/Calls (essentially applying the Max Pain strategy where major Hedge Funds that sell options try to manipulate prices to not go above/below a certain range to ensure the vast majority of options expire worthless.)

10) Depth Charts to view major sell/buy walls

11) Days to Dividend, % Dividend Return

&#x200B;

\*As  a side note, I wanted to mention that I've found Volume to be completely useless attribute, but perhaps I'm not using it right.  Even if I'm able to see if most of the buying is Maker side (which is not always available info), I already can tell because the price is increasing, as one would expect.  The price and Buy Volume I've found are essentially just the same data, if buy volume increases, price increases proportionally.  The only strat I've heard that uses volume that sort of makes sense is that big money Firms tend to increase volume substantially, while keeping price as unchanged as possible, and eventually reduce supply until price eventually does jump.  Other than that, I've yet to find a way to use volume effectively, but please let me know if I'm completely missing something here.

&#x200B;

Thanks for any advice!

2. Don't write your backtesting engine
3. Expect to spend 3-5 years coming up with remotely consistent/profitable method. That's assuming you put 20h+/week in it. 80% spent on your strategy development, 10% on experiments, 10% on automation
4. Watching online videos / reading reddit generally doesn't contribute to your becoming better at this. Count those hours separately and limit them
5. Become an expert in your method. Stop switching
6. Find your own truth. What makes one trader successful might kill another one if used outside of their original method. Only you can tell if that applies to you
7. Look for an edge big/smart money can't take advantage of (hint - liquidity)
8. Remember, automation lets you do more of ""what works"" and spending less time doing that, focus on figuring out what works before automating
9. Separate strategy from execution and automation
10. Spend most of your time on the strategy and its validation
11. Know your costs / feasibility of fills. Run live experiments.
12. Make first automation bare-bones, your strategy will likely fail anyway
13. Top reasons why your strategy will fail: incorrect (a) test (b) data (c) costs/execution assumptions or (d) inability to take a trade. Incorporate those into your validation process

19. Know your expected Max DD. Expect live Max DD be 2x of your worst backtest
20. Don't go down the rabbit hole of thinking learning a new language/framework will help your trading. Generally it doesn't with rare exceptions
21. Increase your trading capital gradually as you gain confidence in your method
22. Once you are trading live, don't obsess over $ fluctuations. It's mostly noise that will keep you distracted
23. Only 2 things matter when running live - (a) if your model=backtest staying within expected parameters (b) if your live executions are matching your model
24. Know when to shutdown your system
25. Individual trade outcome doesn't matter

Edit 1: My post received way more attention than I anticipated. Thanks everyone. Based on some comments people made I would like to clarify if I wasn't clear. This post is not about ""setting up your first trading bot"". My own first took me one weekend to write and I launched it live following Monday, that part is really not a big deal, relatively to everything else afterwards. I'm talking about becoming consistently profitable trading live for a meaningful amount of time (at least couple of years). Withstanding non favorable conditions. It's much more than just writing your first bot. And I almost guarantee you, your first strategy is gonna fail live (or you're truly a genius!). You just need to expect it, have positive attitude, gather data, shut it down according to your predefined criteria, and get back to a drawing board. And, of course, look at the list above, see if you're making any of those mistakes üòâ",njcquf,Advice for aspiring algo-traders

* Which symbols are leading the divergence (I could trade both, but this eats into profit);
* Which direction to trade to take advantage of any re-convergence (this is easy manually when looking at the graphs but more difficult in the code);  and

911,,2021-05-24 17:06:52,t3_nk2uw6,,algotrading,"Recently I've been thinking about developing a backtesting framework based on `ib_insync`, but leveraging Cython and C++ to get rid of the Python overhead as much as possible.

A bit of background: I am software developer specializing in automating my clients‚Äô trading strategies with Interactive Brokers API in Python. I am not a professional trader, or even a hobbyist for that matter, which is why your opinions will be so valuable to me.

In the first step, I am thinking of basically making a perfect copy of `ib_insync` in C++ and exposing to Python with Cython. The goal would be to enable Python developers to write their code either in Cython or Python and be able to seamlessly switch between `ib_insync` and this library with just one line of code in your `main.py`.

The next step would then be to implement Cython tools around that library that will help with backtesting. The idea is that you develop your code for live trading and then just run it with the backtesting harness without having to change your live-ready code at all (no work duplication and not having to maintain two versions). The advantage of this is, again, removing the Python overhead. The speed gain here will be important since, to achieve it, the backtesting will have to run a loop that feeds your algo the historical data candle by candle (or trade by trade) and there will be no vectorizing with `numpy`, all of which is extremely slow in Python.

The final step is build optimization algorithms (genetic algorithms, etc) that leverage all this functionality to optimize your algorithm‚Äôs parameters.

More on the technical side, I've been thinking about this setup for some time, and I think I have the C components I will need to make this happen. For I/O, it‚Äôs possible to use the async [POSIX.1b standard](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Asynchronous-I_002fO.html), [this little library](https://github.com/naasking/async.h/tree/master/async) mimics Python‚Äôs `asyncio`, and [this one](http://www.wangafu.net/~nickm/libevent-book/) can be a replacement for `eventkit`.

As mentioned in the beginning, curious to know your thoughts on this. Do you think that would be useful or not really? Why? One reason I‚Äôm thinking it might be an overkill is perhaps most tick-based strategies are backtested on small time periods, while it‚Äôs the buy-and-hold strategies that will be tested on the longer periods of time, meaning that the size of the backtest would be fairly small in either case.

**Edit:** A couple of you have pointed out there is no need for C++ type of speeds when dealing with the IB API. Very true. I am only considering providing it since, to enable proper C++/Cython optimization in the backtesting portion of the project, I would have to still re-write `ib_insync`'s data classes so as to skip Python checks when passing around things like `Trade` objects. From there, it won't be much more work to provide the rest of the framework as well.",nk2uw6,ib_insync-based Cython/C++ live-trading and backtesting library. Thoughts?

In a zero fee world, I don't think this realistically happens anymore. All orders all sold to internalizers (and disclosed as such)

Nbbo rules, orders are sold to internalizers not routed to market so you're getting a better execution compared to the DISPLAYED liquidity which is all that matters. Interacting with non-displayed liquidity isn't a feature of retail brokerages. You'll need to go with a DMA provider for that (and pay for the execution)

>Aren't HFTs incentivised to execute as low as possible while still remaining in the NBBO?

HFTs are incentivized to get the most order flow, they do this by providing the best price improvement to the broker.

Also, an inherent problem with RL is, it works optimally on known cases ie the data pattern or trend it has seen in the past. Which generally due to stochasticity wouldn't  be as optimal.

Another reason is the issue of the changin environment and action space choices.

Generally in RL the environment is stable meaning and the action choices has the same outcomes in almost all cases. In case of stock market when the agent moves to a new state the environment changes drastically, say if the stock is at all time high or has a very steep rise it wouldn't have optimal strategy then. In short, the movement of the agent would change the environment itself and consequently the rules of the environment. Also there is no guarantee that the learned strategy is an optimal one as everytime you train the strategy changes slightly and in a stochastic environment it can have a cascading effect.

I hope everyone is having a great day today!  I've been pondering an issue, and I was wondering if there was some sort of convention, or what methods you all might have been successful with when it comes to averaging window size vs frequency of the underlying equity's movement.

So, nearly every algorithm that I've coded uses some form of averaging or measurement over a defined window (number of cycles 15 seconds, minute, hour, etc.).  When trading manually, I usually change these periods to match the current movement in the underlying that I'm trading.  Of course, what works best on one day, isn't what will work best at another point in time.  If you averages are too slow, and the frequency of the underlying moves faster, you end up slow to pull the trigger, and you buy high, and sell low.  When you are using to small of period, you can hop in and out of an otherwise great up trend =losing money.

For my bots, I usually manually adjust these until they are good, and then I use a series of nested for loops (Python) to run through all of the different combinations to tune the algorithm to the best performance.  Based on the time period you tune it over it makes a huge difference.  What works best over a five year period, might really suck it for months in a row, but make up for it during big run ups.  If you choose a bear cycle, it won't perform well for bull.  ...and on and on.

I usually choose a fairly short window to run my optimization (as outlined above), and do have the bot do this regularly and adjust.  My thoughts are that this keeps it in step with the current conditions. 

What I've been thinking about lately is to try and perform a Fourier Analysis to determine the strongest frequency of the underlying, and corelate the tuning with that.  I'm assuming that most every strategy uses time window based analysis at it's core, so this is something that should also plague and bot.  So what types of remediation do you guys use for accounting for this.  I guess you could just choose a steady equity with less chop, but for those who trade momentum on higher volatility equities, what have you found that works?

Thanks in advance for any conversation around this!  I really appreciate this community, and I love when there is good debate on techniques.
