I don't think you know what crypto means. I've used cryptography years before blockchain even existed. Seems like you don't know what use case means either. But if by Crypto you mean a cryptocurrency, I already said that is the only valid use case for blockchain. A currency that is stable in value, not inflationary, and anonymous, something like monero perhaps, does have some limited use case.  It can be useful to buy drugs and other illegal substances for example. An inherently inflationary currency however is useless and not a currency at all.

Currently it's mostly seen as an inflation hedge and a lot of the recent sell off (besides China news) is possibly going into gold or other commodities for the same reason.

Also they're whales in every coin that can manipulate the price if they choose.

But literally no one knows where it's headed. BTC could go sub 10k tomorrow or over 100k. Even WSB bans crypto talk on their sub and they love to gamble. That should tell you something.

It's fun to play with and a way to learn technicals but all the timelines are sped up and again crazy volatile so it might just do whatever it wants.

If you sell, you should be able to write off the losses over a couple years. Talk to your accountant about that. If you make over 100k and have no expenses use an accountant. Don't fuck with H&R block or do them yourself. You'll save whatever it costs you and it should only be a few hundred bucks to use an CPA. You should probably be investing more of your money for tax reasons. It's shitty but straight up saving is not the fastest way to accumulate wealth or best use of your money. There's tons of ways to work your money and invest it. 

Also talk to a mortgage broker about an FHA loan. If it's your first home you should be able to put 3.5% down. Interest rates are so low that you might be better off using a small down payment and paying off the principle when it's financially convenient. Remember a phone call is always free.

And if you're going to be an active investor, it's time consuming. You'll spend a lot of your day thinking about money, politics and economics. Do it, get your net worth up bc it gives you freedom.

Bottom line, stay informed, talk to recommended professionals and use your money wisely.

for me it's also the same a bit for the stockmarket, but not as bad. As an investor, it's incredibly dumb investing in something because someone said so.   
Everbody can buy it, the hard part is selling it. I think for example coinbase will gain value over the years, but if I tell you that, as someone who doesn't use or understand crypto exchanges and what makes them different from other exchanges, you will not know when to sell. It might be coinbase, it might even be apple or ford. If the stock market is a gamble, I believe one should at least do some qualified guessing, if you don't understand why and how they make money, you shouldn't invest. For example, did you know that McDonalds isn't really a fast-food chain? they are more like realtors, so if individual stores doesn't sell enough burgers, that doesn't do as much on the price of the company. Investing in McDonalds without knowing how and when they make money is stupid.

&#x200B;

I built an algorithm that tracks mentions and sentiment of stocks across just the WallStreetBets sub (weighted by upvotes, etc.) -- rebalanced monthly. The strategy involves analyzing stocks and conducting sentiment analyses on their mentions to buy or sell. There's a healthy amount of $GME and $AMC, some $SPCE, some $NVDA, and 13 other stocks.

&#x200B;

Right now I'm up 44% YTD, compared to the SP500's 13%.

&#x200B;

Some stats (and a picture of the returns):

&#x200B;

\- The strategy is \*\*backtested\*\* only to the beginning of 2020, but I'm working on it. It's got an \*\*annualized return of 26%\*\* (compared to 16% for the SP500)

&#x200B;

\- \*\*Max drawdown\*\* of -8.7% (thought this was pretty interesting - W\\\*B would be a very cool hedge for financial markets at large. Rode COVID like a wave)

&#x200B;

\- \*\*Sharpe Ratio\*\*: 2.22. Here's an \[investopedia link\]([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharperatio.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharperatio.asp)) for those of you that can read

&#x200B;

\- Profit-Loss ratio of 3.48.

&#x200B;

\- Avg win of 0.85%

&#x200B;

\- Avg loss of -0.24%. The fact that this number's absolute value is lower than average win is a good thing

&#x200B;

Anyways, invested around $60k in January myself, I'm at around $90k rn. Not one of my main investment vehicles, and maybe not the smartest investment, but I make myself feel better by telling myself it's smarter than Y\*LOing on puts.

My sentiment was what is exactly reflected in your post, that it's valuable because the govt says it is, and is no longer backed by gold. My argument is simply that those who accuse bitcoiners of being delusional, are also part of the same delusion, but a worse one at that.

I am curious though, why you think cryptocurrency doesn't make it easier or more cost efficient to trade. On its face it makes sending value quick and frictionless. No need to print and retain paper receipts either. BTC is still in its nascent stage and no doubt has its problems, but it is laying the groundwork as a settlement protocol. Additional layers are being developed on top to solve the problem of cost, throughput, and scalability. Judging it today would be like making a judgement about the internet in 1992.",,

So a double drawdown to 40 and 30 was sort of expected. I actually expected it to pull down to 25 and bounce back as sharp as it did from 30.


Where would I say this is a negated pattern: difficult to tell, since the numbers are so big it will offer a fairly large margin of error, which is of course unsatisfactory.

So if consider the start of the latest impulse wave not at the bottom of the pandemic drop, but rather at the sideways move a year ago, I would say baseline is around 9000-9500. And the full wave in 535 was up to 42k, with the 5 move to 1.618 to 62k was the overextension with rsi and Macd divergence. Then the full retracement would be to the .618 level which is 29k.

*However* also the .5 level is possible which is 25kish.

I would consider the move to break down if we hit 21 or lower. 

I know, those are some big ranges, but given the size of the upmove, and the volatility, this is about the numbers we're looking at.",,

Gold is doing good and definitely not having big drops. If I had a dime outside of crypto to bet, I'd bet some huge regulation news is coming. I'd imagine true crypto investors that have been in for nearly a decade or longer are sick to their stomachs right now. The whole point of this is deregulation and allowing the small investor to make money, but it's now abundantly clear that the same whales manipulating the stock market are now taking part in crypto and destroying something that was awesome. Then regulations will come under the guise of ""protecting the little investor"" when it actually moves the goalposts insanely in the whale's favor. 
It's just really hard for me to fathom how every single coin simultaneously plummets. It let's me know very few people hold the majority of all coins and they're in every single coin, even the shit coins. Moving forward, we all need to write down goals and targets that we pull at least 50% profit if not 70%. At any moment the rug can be pulled out from under us, regardless if your coin choose is good or not. 

Idk about y'all but I've missed out on at least 25k this year by just holding and waiting for the big surge.. here's the secret though.. even if it has a big surge it still corrects and allows us to jump back in. 

And now I not only missed out on that 25k, but I'm back at square fucking one. Before I at least had 100-150% gains that were staying, so I kept telling myself, ""I don't need to pull any profits it will keep going up"".. I still believe that it will in the long run, but I'd love to have that 25k I missed by not pulling. I'd throw half into xrp and XLM right now and just not even think about it until I see crypto trending again 🤷‍♂️

Sorry I'm rambling, but I have nobody to talk to about this and I'm afraid of what I might do if someone even looks at me wrong, if I don't get this off my chest 😆😆😆😆",njka4i,Say it is not so????

Let me preface this by saying I've read (line-by-line) the full source code of bitcoind (the official implementation), and most of an earlier version of lnd (a Go implementation of the Bitcoin Lightning Network). So I understand the technology

Bitcoin's blockchain keeps track of unspent transaction outputs, in other words the ""balance"" of accounts. An account is a set of private cryptographic keys. Bitcoin is a method of transferring coin ownership from one account to another, in public. Doing these transfers is trivial if you have a private database

Bitcoin's blockchain is simply a method of maintaining a public database. The alternative is a private database on bank computers. But you have to trust the banks and the government

To understand Bitcoin intuitively, watch a real-time animated visualization of the global Bitcoin transaction flow, as it is happening right now. This shows how Bitcoin is being used, right now, in real-time:

https://dailyblockchain.github.io/

Each square is a bitcoin address (similar to a cryptographic public key)

Each graph component is a transaction. The components appear as transactions are broadcast into the bitcoin P2P network (but before they are verified and committed to the blockchain)

Each transaction simply transfers bitcoin: from one or more input addresses, to one or more output addresses. In other words, money flows from one or more previous owners, to one or more new owners. That's how a currency works

Coin ownership flows from green to red (yellow is in/out: I pay you and take some change back at the same address)

When the output of one transaction becomes an input for a new transaction, the components are pulled together

For comparison, Visa handles about 1700 transactions per second. Bitcoin transactions are very expensive (mining fees) and very slow due to intrinsic limitations of the technology (broadcast P2P blockchain consensus). The only benefit is that there's no trusted central authority and a deterministic supply of bitcoins (controlled inflation)

Here are the current transaction fees. This is how much you pay a miner to include your transaction in a block. It is very expensive if you want fast inclusion, and very slow if you don't want to pay:

Which would make it a good buy if you’re looking for something to buy in anticipation of a market correction.  Except even that is kind of bs logic.  During small corrections, negative beta might help you out.  If it ends up being a big correction, that negative beta is unlikely to hold.

- crypto market cap is beginning to approach gold - it's unlikely that it can reach and maintain gold's market cap without having any intrinsic value",,

Tesla’s valuation is at ~600x of its earnings, in order to continue commanding that it needs to keep growing at the same pace, even with competitors moving in and their moat getting smaller and smaller. If bonds go up it doesn’t necessarily mean Tesla investors will flee to 2-3% bond yields (although that would’ve had been a better trade ytd than Tesla), but it could mean Tesla will need to spend more money on debtors by almost 2x. Bonds increasing means growth companies can’t grow as fast as they once could, meaning multiples get smaller and people look for a bigger a balance of growth and value in companies. It’s why even the fear of rising rates has caused Tesla’s price to drop by almost half",,

Note I prefer higher time frames, like the monthly candles, because there is soo much noise on daily and weekly charts,

Of course the confidence in a bull era, above higher time frames important moving averages adds confidence smaller time frames will resolve upwards.

I said about the enclosed chart at the bottom that it ABSOLUTELY BLOWS MY MIND,

&#x200B;

*Processing img 548ooaq1ny071...*

 

Zooming in, friday 's bounce off bottom of formation, during 6x spike in volume. Nice try. This formation has proven rock solid over & over since March. Breaking it will take more than dumping 50,000,000 ounces in 5 minutes. Nowhere to go but up for now.

Because we see charts the way The Banks do.

2. Fed admits inflation may not be transitory

From fed : A number of participants remarked that supply chain bottlenecks and input shortages may not be resolved quickly and, if so, these factors could put upward pressure on prices beyond this year.

Justput oil prices so you can expect CPI where :

WTİ >67 Usd bets are 100 usd end of year ?

&#x200B;

 

3. Music stops for Silver and Gold alternatives :

China opens its borders for gold imports. ( supportive for silver action )

Here is the Chinese offical goverment stance for Gold and silver from the following article so obvious . This is the first time saw that kind of bullish news . especially important that this news from Chinese official goverment declaration

[https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202105/1224071.shtml](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202105/1224071.shtml)

Chinese Social media platform pointed out that some users call for switch to Gold which they said was more stable than crytpocurrencies 

Music stopped ! for gold and silver alternatives for cyrptocurrencies  .

Who remembers the feeling when you road trip to a NEW destination...  90 km feels an eternity, and that you'll never get there.  But once you arrive at destination, the travel doesn't feel as long anymore.  This is what you felt in a correction.  You have arrived. 

Still too complicated for many .

4. Big adds from SLV and PSLV this month the first after February almost 15 million ozz per month this is 2 % increase in total ETFS . Somebodies almost see the light

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h5i7gg6mny071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a0310b3b90029e9cf3152efae289c5293865baa

&#x200B;

 

5.USD index ( DXY) breaking ;

One of the drivers for the next strong move up in silver will be the USD index (DXY) breaking below the Feb '18 low of 88.15 and descending into its 3yr cycle low. It is currently on calendar day 84 of the current intermediate cycle. They usual run 160-280 calendar days.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vqaldu9ony071.png?width=3211&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a43b35690ed6091d664048f4f0b262537c3bc05

 

6. Modeled Gold Price:

CPI inflation index is a poor historical tracker of the gold price. The pink dashed line below shows the cycle high price of $35/oz price from 1934 projected forward using CPI scaling. Clearly, M2 scaling with a mine-supply discount tracks the gold price much better.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rokba99qny071.png?width=3228&format=png&auto=webp&s=8266ba12aaeca17f9f9b6c0a7eada8e2fefc710c

 

Once this is all behind us, there should be a strong move up in gold into the summer. After that, I would expect the next big move in gold to be a push up to \~$3000 by mid-2022 .

7. Gold /silver Ratio :

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5wcx3jbsny071.png?width=513&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2500d8f5c1539c5a13d9eb9dc944fc11455a557

 

So silver will lead the metals and the gold/silver ratio, now at 67, will initially reach 30 like. The long term target is likely to be a lot lower, probably 15 or below. As talked before the expected Gold prices 3.000 usd in the mid of 2022 and with gold /silver ratio we can expect price range 150 -200 Usd /ozz which is x8 gain from actual 27.6 usd /ozz price .

Now our tickets :

1. Physical Silver bars coins , or other stuff just as an example : This is normally the best silver investment type if you can find with reasonable premiums .Nowadays the premiums are sky high due to reddit silver enhusiasm so for most late comers almost it is over . Spot at $27.65. Some internet sites selling eagles for $44.28. Either something big is coming and they know it or someone selling this to you is wearing a ski mask. Either way, not sure why you would buy this product at this price.

&#x200B;

2. PSLV Reaches $4 BILLION in Assets! 144,213,789 total ounces of Physical Silver  
53 million ounces of physical silver added in 2021 . Actually now only feasible alternative . Fully liquid and buy and sell in a second and also hedge yourself .

3. ZSİL ( swiss ) , or other European allocated ETFS .

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

At least 10 /20 % silver add to your portfolios as hedges and don't miss out this once a time opportunity .

Lastly :

The fact that I'm seeing so few cheerleaders getting giddy about the upside in precious metals and miners is a welcome positive for further gains  in the weeks and months ahead imho. 

&#x200B;

Berkshire has $700 billion of assets, of which Apple is $110 billion. The stock portfolio, above, is held by Berkshire's huge insurance conglomerate

Berkshire has numerous large wholly-owned subsidiaries like BNSF Railroad, GEICO insurance, Clayton Homes, International Metalworking, Precision Castparts, MiTek, Fruit of the Loom, General Re, MidAmerican Energy, National Indemnity, Johns Manville, ACME Brick, etc.

Berkshire is **by far the largest company in America**, as measured by book value (assets minus liabilities)

We’ve already had a year-long field test with it, and many companies have noted that there wasn’t actually a decrease in productivity from WFH. On the contrary, employees feel they get more value out of their time due to not having to travel to/from an office. They are able to utilize their time in a way that complements their lifestyle, and they can save on day-to-day expenses like gas and food.  
  
Meanwhile, businesses can downsize their overhead by reducing the scale of their faculties and utility expenses. They can also save on relocation and cost-of-living expenses.
  
Also, surveys have indicated that many employees have no interest in returning to cubicles, and would quit if forced to. I already know of some that have pre-emptively moved away from cities and bought houses in cheaper areas with no intention of returning. Companies that *do* offer permanent WFH benefits (and there are many already deciding to this), will have competitive edge over other businesses when vetting new hires.",,
