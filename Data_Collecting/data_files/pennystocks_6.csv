So this is a post on how those stocks went.

AVHOQ, 	0.375, TRUE	, 0.42, 	12

CRRFY, 	4.172, 	TRUE	, 4.17, 	-0.05

So this is a pretty good week I would say.

Someone recently pointed out to me that a few of my results ran after a week so this is going back 2 weeks now:

LTMAQ	, 2.3, 	FALSE,2.7,17. 39

So that's an average of 30.02% change in 2 weeks. You would however have been better off doing the 26.05% change on the first week then 7.25 of this week giving you 35.18% in the past 2 weeks (assuming you reinvested)

https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/njd23q/my_stock_screener_results_for_the_past_week/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

For those of you that don't know I have been working on a stock screener, I have big success in the past my highest week being 30% and my lowest is - 3% it is usually ~4-8% each week. Last week was a 7.25% increase. 

This weeks results:

Symbols, price, score

CRRFY	4.17	16.15290245

ESOA	2.05	14.24498567

FINMY	4.16	13.37397541

HOFSQ	0.0244	33.47319677

LTMAQ	2.69	7.264516129

PSIX	4.21	8.166632081

SIGL	1.07	21.32972878

These results are from my own heuristic algorithm. Which essentially filters to make sure that the stocks meet certain criteria. 

First filter is that the revenue is twice the market cap, second is that the average volume from 60-30 days ago is less than the last 2 weeks. Third is price (under 5) and lastly is my movement filter which determines if the stock has had much movement in the past week. I obviously don't want to be catching a stock after the peak of pump and dump. This has been moved to part of the score. 

The score is new this week, I am not sure how well it will work but if it does that would be good. Its based on market cap revenue and volume. So if there is a higher volume then higher score, higher times the market cap fits into revenue etc.

I plan to host this on a website in the not so distant future. I in fact have it made and ready to go, just need to deploy it. 

I plan to create a ranking system on how likely I think it is to increase. 

I advise that everyone do your own research on these before investing, just an interesting thing to share.

I will be posting the results from these stocks and the next weeks results next weekend.

I am happy to answer any questions and talk about any suggestions on how to improve in the comments.",njd87e,My stock screener looking ahead

157,,2021-05-23 19:49:14,t3_njfk83,,pennystocks,"Huge upcoming moves for somewhat hidden gem WRHLF - Love Hemp. Currently Listed on OTCQB (and AQSE under $LIFE).

The run up this week to June 1 and beyond could be huge. The current SP is a minuscule 4.1 cents compared to it's potential in the short term. Seems to be flying under the radar for the most part - has relatively low volume thus far.

The company has a promotional partnership with UFC effective June 1 ([https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/world\_high\_life/news/rns/story/rmqd5vw](https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/world_high_life/news/rns/story/rmqd5vw)), with North American expansion marketing access to UFC fans. The agreement allows Love Hemp to access UFC’s physical and digital assets, as well as the marketing opportunities. This includes usage of UFC trademarks, logos and brand on a global basis, which will increase visibility and recognition across the 625 million UFC fans worldwide. Products are expected to be co-branded and UFC promotion of the company will begin.

Beyond the 1st, they'll continue taking off and growing the business and SP:

CATALYSTS

Possibly this week: PRs around ramping up for the June 1 UFC partnership and North America expansion, including the completion of the new production facility to increase volume up to 5x from current levels and will have the capacity to manufacture up to 500,000 CBD products a month.

June 1: Starts exclusive 5 year CBD partnership with UFC.

June 1: North American launch (currently in the UK market) to coincide with UFC partnership.

2021: Intent to up-list to London Stock Exchange (Europe's largest exchange) [https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/world\_high\_life/news/rns/story/x8o469r](https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/world_high_life/news/rns/story/x8o469r)

2021: Expansion into Japan/Germany/Korea/Australia. Will be within in 1 day delivery of 1 billion customers.

\-28mil market cap and approx 10mil sales. Many CBD companies have far higher market cap valuations though they have less sales. So much room for growth with this ticker on that fact alone. Virtually no debt. 8.89% owned by insiders / 16.63% owned by insiders + the largest (non-insider) shareholder. 83% publicly held shares.

\-Currently selling at \~2000 physical locations (including leading brands such as Sainsbury’s, Boots, Ocado and Holland & Barrett) with 40 product lines. Once the UFC deal gets underway, expected to increase volume massively as UFC consumers demand product. Amazing listing likely imminent.

\-U.S. Legal Cannabis Market Projected to Double to $41.5B by 2025 ([https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/09/2142171/0/en/U-S-Legal-Cannabis-Market-Projected-to-Double-to-41-5B-by-2025.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/09/2142171/0/en/U-S-Legal-Cannabis-Market-Projected-to-Double-to-41-5B-by-2025.html)). No doubt Love Hemp is well positioned over that time to capitalize on the growth of the market with the UFC partnership deal in particular. 

\-Founders of Love Hemp also founded Supreme Cannabis. They've recently re-signed (UFC's) Kamaru Usman as Brand Ambassador (Apr 22/2021 [https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/world\_high\_life/news/rns/story/w6qj3kr](https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/world_high_life/news/rns/story/w6qj3kr)) GSP was also a brand ambassidor previously.

On the flip side, with outstanding warrants shares could dilute up to around 29% eventually. However, not concerned as the current valuations and catalysts far outweigh the effects of the potential dilution. 

IMO amazing entry pricing at this point, considering the upcoming short and longer/2021-term catalysts. I'm in with avg 4 cents for \~100k and looking to add more this week as possible.

Not financial advice, my opinion only.",njfk83,Big moves upcoming for $WRHLF - Love Hemp

The amount of adjustment and moves they are making is exactly what they should be doing and they are right on track to turn this around towards the end of the year which is why I'm recommending to get in this now and HOLD. It will recover. It's Rolls-Royce ffs. This is a great price and 3-4Q is when it's expected to start climbing. 

So much info I suggest you actually read it all. 



Not too long ago Rolls Royce announced that it acquired the company Servowatch Systems with the aim of entering the ship automation industry. It is a significant development and one that will pay dividends long term. They also have recently partnered with Infosys a global leader in next-generation digital services and consulting. This will be used in their upcoming movement towards ship automation. 

 Not even mentioning 16,000 military engines with 160 customers in 103 different countries (war is always inevitable).

The good outlook 

A turning point?
Rolls-Royce sells jet engines for airliners along with many other ventures but it makes most of its profits from aftersales maintenance and support services. When aircraft are grounded, airlines don’t need these services because the engines aren’t in use.

However, that situation is starting to change. Aero engineer Meggitt reports that domestic flying in markets such as the US and China has already rebounded strongly. Here in the UK, the government is expected to start lifting restrictions on travel to Europe in May. Rolls-Royce isn’t expected to return to profit until late 2021 into 2022. But the stock market always looks forward and I think we’re at a turning point. In my view, the outlook for Rolls-Royce will start to improve during the second half of this year drastically. They are priced for bankruptcy on the market and this is way too pessimistic when aligned with the reality of how soon they can start to turn profit and what they have lined up. - This is from an analysis not me but matches my opinion. 

It's coming boys, patience is a virtue. Plus how safe can you get. Check the chart. It's an INVESTMENT. I understand that's a very rare word around here but tell me the last year has been normal. 

But why not leave you more, don't sleep on a solid investment.

Good luck this week guys and I really hope you consider putting a small portion into a long-term investment that should pay 100-300% over 1-2 years.

Aeroapace, nautical, nuclear, cars, you name it they are trying to move into the sector. This isn't some company you've never heard of this is Rolls-Royce. See you at the top investors.

There’s a term ‘don’t catch a falling knife’ (USUALLY used in penny stocks)... that where the stock just keeps falling n it’ll hurt u. Then often it’s better to get out n save any $ u can salvage. On ‘good’ stocks that doesn’t happen so much (but COULD).
Example of ur original question... Twitter was around $75 a couple months back, now it’s in the $50’s I believe. If ur in @ $70-$75, etc. (really anything over $50) u buy the dip in the $50’s and ur ave. Cost per sh. Is lowered. Let’s say u get ur average down to $60... now if Twitter returns to the $70’s range or higher, u’ll make more overall.
U can also buy a stock going up to even if ur in lower, if u think it’s going to keep going higher.

193,gz78mjj,2021-05-23 20:44:12,t1_gz78mjj,t3_nint1f,pennystocks,"Im up 20% and i can tell you guys what you are doing wrong.

1. short term charts and technicals are pure voodoo.  read: scam alert.  Technicals were invented to look at where the bulk of volume occurs in a daily relative to that days high and low to identify the LONG TERM direction of the bid/asks.  Looking at 5d chart or even a 1month chart is astrology.  NM a 5 minute chart.  Someone starts talking that nonsense and you should immediately mute them.
2. Market cap over 100m, float over 1b = avoid.  And these are the tiniest price per shares.  But its misleading and scammy.  Just like safemoon.  ""if even a few of these zeroes drop off""....that would put the market cap at trillions bro.  They do it on purpose.  They dump out all these shares in the public at a tiny price per and ppl think ""wow, its .0007, imagine if it  went to even $1.  Meanwhlie, the company has no revenue and is valued at 80m.  

3. Dont chase so much.  Dont look for the next thing that is going to boom (ignore all short term technicals).  Look for something that has 0 chatter.  ""but it when its quiet.""  Patience is required.  Find undervalued, tight share structures and ease in over time.  The less hype while you are accumulating, the better.  Dont go for the top mentions.  Dont go for ""the chart says its about to fly"".  

4. I dont know who told y'all reverse splits were a bad thing, but thanks everyone for the cheap High Tide shares.  Me and my money manager friends are scooping them with gusto.  Because reverse splits are GOOD.  Tight share structures are GOOD.  Yes something at 0.5 appears to have more rocket potential than something at 7.5, but its appearance only.  Its the market cap, not the share price.  

5. For goodness sakes, mix in some adult stocks will you?  20% OTCs and pennies is probs where you want to be (max).    

6. Watch your tax implications and try not to trigger wash sales   

7. Sentiment can change, outlook can change.  Market cycles change.  Not every dip is buy worthy.  

8. There is value in a 3% (or better) dividend  

9. Im at the bottom and I regret that this is coming off snarky.  But I dont want to go up and edit.  So apologies for any snark.  Im trying to be direct, but not rub anything in.  But my concern is that some of you are down and are going to get huge tax bills because you wont be able to take any losses due to wash sales rules.  Also, i fear that actually, we are do for a market correction.  Thats what the money managers are saying.  And if you think the pennies/otcs are going to hold up better than the large caps during a correction, you are wrong.  People will run to large cap value/dividend and they will hold up better (but still not well).  In a bear market otc / pennies / speculative get CRUSHED, and we're due for a bear cycle.  Just because you are down , doesnt mean the SPY is.  Sorry, not trying to be aggressive.  I post a lot here.  I wish you all success.  But money managers are not your enemy.

Regular stocks I screen for revenue and EPS growth. For pennies, one of my screens is just revenue growth, then I just look at the balance sheet, etc to see if they are moving in the right direction. For example, If a penny is close to or becoming debt free so they can acquire assets, that is good for a penny stock, but their current financials might not look so hot. I almost have to follow their Press Releases just to get good up to the date info. 
VBHI is a decent example. I own some of this penny bc they are now debt free, and they have been acquiring revenue producing assets. They did dilute their stock shares to get $ to buy assets, but I still like their plan. But if you took a quick snap shot look at their last financial statement, you certainly wouldn’t be overwhelmed.

306,,2021-05-24 00:19:50,t3_njl4mb,,pennystocks,"So Clubq has had a rough year with the pandemic. Truth be told the company wasn't doing great before it. It had a bad plan with even worse execution. That being said the bankruptcy has changes alot.

Kenedy Lewis who was looking to buy the whole company during the pandemic ended up as 51 percent owner through stock on only the premium clubs TMPL? LIV and Palm Beach sports clubs. (TMPL isn't listed on site but I think its still part)

Town sports no longer owns NYSC BSC PSC and WSC. These assets were sold off to a private company and are not part of the stock. 

Patrick Walsh is still CEO of these clubs and had alot of his personal money invested in town sports which makes me belive he will do alot not to cancel the shares. 

The company now sits with its best club and a check book to compete in the gym biz worth about 100 million dollars (alot more then the current cap of 4 million) 

The company has added directors and has assigned them stock as compensation. 

So where to from here? Does the gym world pick up now that the pandemic is over in the US? I think so.

Does this stock get canceled? It seems town sports international llc was a subsidiary of Town sports holdings llc which also owned the premium clubs which aren't listed in the bankruptcy papers at all. I checked and don't see them. 

What would be the fair value of this stock with the credit line it has. I think they are in a good place to profit as many landlord would be open and the ceo has a history with them.",njl4mb,$Clubq fresh fish or cod stew?

468,,2021-05-24 04:42:01,t3_njpq9i,,pennystocks,"I know the general deal with sub-penny stocks and have been investing on and off for a couple of  years now as a hobby. I have learned to use various stock screeners, look at Market Cap, previous week and month performance, 52-week range, the day's range, volume, average volume, do my research in various places for upcoming catalysts, news, new products, new ownership, acquisitions of other companies, etc.  I have also learned to check the 5-day and 1-month pricing, search for stocks that have dropped like 90% in price recently due to the market being down in general (because the odds of them going back up are pretty good) and stuff like that.

I have YOLO'ed into a number of .0001 penny stocks months ago when virtually every sub-penny stock was growing like crazy for no reason. Made thousands of dollars in profit during that time. I have also meticulously researched stocks, went with the flow of the masses and invested like crazy with tens of thousands of other people only to find out that a couple of ""great"" companies were a sham and their CEO was prosecuted because said product didn't exist at all.

I have learned the difference between market orders, limit orders and stop loss orders. A lot of what I have done so far, even when I took big losses, taught me valuable lessons of what to do and what not to do in the future. Now I'm looking for more info.

I have used the stock screeners of [otcmarkets.com](https://otcmarkets.com) and learned to look for the stocks that are defunct, have a stop sign on them, suspended by the SEC, etc. I've learned to look for signs that the company is going nowhere or potentially a scam. I have also used [barchart.com](https://barchart.com) and some other places for even more screening of stocks because with otcmarkets, while helpful in some ways in regards to finding out if a stock is legit or not, the actual stock price is always incorrect. Typically it is already way higher than what otcmarkets lists. It will say .0001 and when you look on somewhere like Yahoo Finance or any broker website, the price is like .0015 and has been for sometimes weeks.

I know that in general .0001 stocks are a shot in the dark. However, if one researches a good company that already has a decent amount of employees, potential future news/catalysts and such...it can't go down anymore without going out of business. The chances of it going up are much higher, however.

I find that I have problems buying a lot of sub-penny stocks even when they have SEC filings/earnings posted, I exceed the bid price, match the current ask price and it has tens or even hundreds of millions in volume daily. It just sits there until the day is done and the order is still ""open"" for no reason. I've noticed that a lot lately, even with stocks that have hundreds of millions of shares being traded daily. I see nothing that I'm doing incorrectly.

I have also noticed that some sites like [Barchart.com](https://Barchart.com) are way more up to date with more .0001 stocks and current prices compared to even [otcmarkets.com](https://otcmarkets.com) and that's a bit puzzling.

This got me to wondering...is there a website where I can find NEW .0001 startup companies that don't have a large following yet and are just coming to market? Surely there has to be SOME kind of official list at the SEC or elsewhere where these new startup companies are listed when they first go onto the market as a .0001 stock. Granted, it could be a long time before they actually see growth. In the meantime, I'm one of the people who starts out with a million shares, waits for it to go to .0002 and sells, then buys back 2 million shares again at .0001. I like to gather tens of millions of shares and then hold for future growth. Then do the same for other stocks simultaneously.

IF TLDR: What sites do you guys use for stock screeners for .0001 penny stocks and where can I find an official list of new companies coming to the market as .0001 stocks?

I know that a lot of .0001 stocks were also previously existing companies that had a higher stock price and some scandal, issue, etc., happened and they fell down to a triple zero stock. But I don't feel that it is unreasonable in any way to think that there must be a list somewhere of officially new companies that are literally just starting out and offering stocks at .0001. There has to be somewhere. Where can I find it and what is it called?",njpq9i,Is there an official page where NEW startup companies are listed as .0001 stocks?

If you're going to make a lot of trades, or only buy small amounts, you'll probably want Fidelity or Schwab, because there's no fee to buy or sell.

If you're going to buy large quantities, or not do a lot of trading, you might be happy with TD Ameritrade or E-Trade. Their apps are a little easier to use, but they charge $6.95 per transaction when buying OTC stocks. (No charge for ""regular"" stocks.)

If you're going to buy a lot of Canadian, or other foreign stock (assuming you're in the US), you'll want E-Trade, because there's no extra Foreign Stock fee to buy or sell. (Schwab and Fidelity charge $50, and TD Ameritrade charges $15. You'll pay that both when you buy and when you sell.)

It's okay to have accounts with more than one of them. None of them charge you money to open an account. Some of them have promotions, like if you put a certain amount of money in your account to start, they'll add a little more. Google to see what promotions might work for you, but don't choose a broker because of that.

Don't use Robinhood. Google, and you'll find many reasons why.

Full Disclosure: I have E-Trade by default. My original account was with Sharebuilder, which became Capital One Investing, and then E-Trade. I'm very happy with them, and love the app. (If you have $200 or more in your account, you get access to a great real-time live ticker.) I also have Schwab. I got it because of the lack of OTC transaction fees, but hate their app, and have personally found them slow to execute my orders. (Many others in here love them, so please don't go by me.)",,

It seems that pennystocks and OTCs in particular, fundemental DD seems to resolve around, company dropping fins and working on current status followed by shareholder letter or some big announcement, or other news like mergers, custos, reinstatements, etc... 

Basically it seems that DD for OTCs is more short term and riding the hype and not something like ""hey this 5B outstanding shares company has a cool concept and good growth potential for next 5 years"" so its tough for me to value it long term.

I am curious how to value these things short term? Like if I catch an unknown company today that's likely going to reverse merger and I know which company it will reverse into then I would be all over it cos I know no matter what it will explode when rest of traders catch on and so I wouldn't know how to value it but I would just be guessing that hype will run up like we seen with GGII, TSNP etc...

Second, how do you DD these OTCs? They don't produce books for how to do this haha, their are some twitter people that do have courses like @KickoStocks and @ShortSqueezed1 who have courses on OTC trading just not sure I am willing to pay for this stuff... I heard people say to keep it simple, to use otcmarkets to view fins and mergers and to use another website (forgot the name its paid subscription) to view reinstatements etc...",njuouv,Is it enough to read DD posted by others on reddit and twitter or you need your own DD?

They'll teach you some bs technical analysis that doesn't work in regular markets let alone OTCs where the price only moves because of said herd jumping into the same play. Great example is Tim Sykes and the stock SNPW back in February. I live in RI where the SNPW company has this waste to energy facility that's not even approved or likely to happen, yet all these bag holders bought in at 20 cents or higher based on these false catalysts and Sykes posted about the stock and thousands of his chat room members pumped and dumped the stock back down to single digits after it went from 3 cents to 30. Now stocktwits and reddit etc are full of people down 60-90% on their position and they refuse to sell because of 'Biden green new deals' and 'Gina Raimondo connections' or 'solar stock play!'.

My point is not necessarily even about CTXR.  Just that to me, a P&D is a scam.  Artificially juice the value, intentionally, with the plan of dumping on people buying in late.  


All Im really trying to say is that there is a lot of middle ground between something being a pump & dump and something being great long term.  


Regarding CTXR, my personal opinion is that the mkt cap is a little high for my tastes for an early stage bio company.  But I think its a good company.  If I was to rate it strong buy (A+) or buy (B+) or strong hold (B-) or cautious hold (c-), or sell (D), or strong sell (F-)  


I would prob but CTXR on the line between buy and strong hold (solid B).  Before its recent run, when the market cap was lower, I would have rated it a B+.  So I think its a solid play, even after the run.  


But again, my comment was not necessarily about CTXR, just that not everything that isnt ""great long term"" isnt necessarily a P&C scam.  I would say that only a few tickers are ""great long term"" cuz thats a high bar, and I would also say that only a few tickers are ""P&D scams.""  Most tickers are somewhere in between.",,

You will see the current rules and the updated rules below.

I   am thinking once companies who are not current or in danger of not   being traded on public exchanges start dropping filing after filing,   there will be the beginning of an OTC trend.

Lets   assume not every company will or can go current. So I wanted a place   for us to post a company ticker that we feel will make all the   appropriate filings to go pink current with updated information. Lets   not forget, there are Pink current with no information. SEC wants   updated information, but if you read the rules, you will also see   international companies who are listed on a major exchange with no   information on OTC are exempt from the rules and can remain current pink   on OTC.

**So who can get current before September**?   I ask that you PLEASE do not post just any OTC ticker. Post tickers   that you know is not current/missing info, is still active, and you feel   they have put in enough time and money to grow that they would be   foolish not to get current. Also please give an explanation why you   think they are a good candidate to go current before September and if   you want to include links that is fine too.

I will start,

$PHIL- going to be dropping 2020 10k in 1 or 2 weeks and current shortly after. Tons of DD on on it.

On Friday, May 21st, South Korean President Moon Jae-in met with President Biden where [steps were taken to reinforce economic cooperation between the two countries](https://twitter.com/MOTIEKoreaEng/status/1396060830622384130?s=20). Tellurian quoted the tweet stating “[TellurianLNG ready to support this cooperation 🇺🇸 + 🇰🇷with #USLNG from Driftwood $TELL #LNG](https://twitter.com/TellurianLNG/status/1396127896939515906?s=20)”.

This tweet may be a tease but we all know what they’re trying to tell us.[ South Korea was the top country for US LNG exports in September 2020!](https://twitter.com/lngglobal/status/1328389385872498689?s=20)

What is Tellurian?

Tellurian was founded in 2016 by two industry icons, Charif Souki and Martin Houston. Charif set in motion the first liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports from the United States Lower 48 and founded Cheniere Energy. Martin originated the concept of LNG destination flexibility, ensuring that LNG became a commodity. 

Tellurian is currently a debt-free company!

What is LNG?

[Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is natural gas that has been cooled down to liquid form for ease and safety of non-pressurized storage or transport. It takes up about 1/600th of the volume of natural gas in the gaseous state. LNG is odorless, colorless, non-toxic, and non-corrosive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquefied_natural_gas).

When LNG is returned to its gaseous state, it is used across the residential, commercial, and industrial sectors for purposes as diverse as heating, cooking, generating electricity, and manufacturing a wide variety of products. LNG is also used as a fuel for heavy-duty and other vehicles.

Who is Charif Souki?

To put it in simple terms…Charif Souki is the Elon Musk of LNG.

Charif co-founded Tellurian and serves as Executive Chairman of the Board. He also founded Cheniere Energy, Inc. in 1996 and served as Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and President until December 2015. Prior to Cheniere, Charif was an investment banker. He serves on the board of trustees of the American University of Beirut and as a member of the Advisory Board of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. Charif received a B.A. from Colgate University and an MBA from Columbia University.

[Charif Souki was the highest-paid CEO in 2013](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2014/04/29/does-cheniere-energys-ceo-really-deserve-142-million-annual-pay/?sh=40567db29c59); this proves that he’s the real deal. Charif Souki was voted out of his position at Cheniere by [Carl Icahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Icahn). Charif Souki was fired because he wanted to expand Cheniere with projects such as Driftwood whereas Carl wanted to spend their cash flows on dividends. Carl Icahn to date has never met Charif Souki in person.

Charif Souki resurrected his Driftwood plans by co-founding Tellurian. 

What is Driftwood?

[Driftwood LNG LLC](http://driftwoodlng.com/), owned by Tellurian Inc., is developing a liquefied natural gas (LNG) production and export terminal on the west bank of the Calcasieu River, south of Lake Charles, Louisiana. Once complete, the terminal will be able to export up to twenty-seven million, six hundred thousand tonnes of LNG per year to customers worldwide.

Tellurian’s Team

The team at Tellurian together accounts for 75% of the LNG export from the USA today. In 2020; 5281 BCF of Natural Gas was exported from the USA. At current JKM (Asian Market) prices for June 2021, that is equivalent to around $37,508,302,500. At current TTF prices (European Market) prices for June 2021, that is equivalent to around $32,161,290,000. These numbers tell you that the team at Tellurian is no joke and should not be taken lightly. 

The President & CEO of Tellurian, Octávio Simões brings 38 years of impressive energy industry experience to Tellurian’s remarkable infrastructure team. Previously, he was President and CEO of Sempra LNG & Midstream where he was responsible for all LNG and natural gas midstream activities in Sempra’s efforts to develop, build and operate liquefied natural gas (LNG) receipt terminals, liquefaction facilities, natural gas pipelines, and storage facilities. He led the company’s efforts at Cameron LNG, Energia Costa Azul LNG and Port Arthur LNG, where he focused on reliability of deliveries to customers, safety and gas sourcing strategies that assure reliable production of LNG. Octávio has deep relationships in the LNG market and an unmatched tenacity for developing new projects.

Martin Houston the Vice Chairman and Co-founder is also an LNG veteran with nearly 40 years of experience. He’s managed all forms of enterprise in the energy industry, has established a strong external reputation in the international gas business, and is largely credited with being the key architect of BG Group’s world-class LNG business. In recognition of this, in 2011 he was the first recipient of the CWC LNG Executive of the Year award.

Why hasn’t Driftwood started construction yet?

The Driftwood project will cost $27.5 Billion including pipelines. Driftwood will produce 27.6 MTPA of LNG. Tellurian has been looking for Equity partners to help with the funding of Driftwood. Tellurian currently has one equity partner which is TOTAL SE. If FID for Driftwood isn’t reached by June 2021 then TOTAL can choose to back out of their position. If they choose to exit, it won’t be an issue for the company as Charif Souki[ “said building the terminal is no longer dependent on the Total agreement.”](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/natural-gas/051221-tellurian-to-finish-commercialization-of-driftwood-lng-first-phase-in-few-weeks-souki) Tellurian currently has all permits required for Driftwood and Charif Souki confirmed that they are intending on starting basic construction this summer and planning on giving [Bechtel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechtel) the green light to begin full construction early next year.

What’s going on with commercial agreements?

In a [recent interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhmSef_1eUM) with [Citi Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citigroup), Charif Souki stated that ""We want to finish our commercial agreements, which will happen in the next few weeks,” Souki said the offering has been very popular and, if Tellurian hits its target in the next few weeks, would be oversubscribed.

A [recent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbQuICpNTYU) targeting Short Sellers was posted by Tellurian. Charif Souki asked the shorts “What do you think is going to happen when we start announcing some of these long-term commercial agreements that we’ve been working on for so long? This will be an interesting question and we will see how the market reacts when this happens.” - We are the market and it’s our time to react.

Our Friends over at Citadel decided to buy [Puts](https://imgur.com/a/EWrhH4T) for TELL 🤦‍♂️ - How many times do we have to tell them not to mess with us 😤

Is TELL a quick trade or a long-term hold?

Charif Souki has made it [clear](https://youtu.be/kQn-eMCbjaM?t=727) that he is building a business and that TELL is not a trade. If you just want quick profits then this stock is NOT for you! 

Tellurian’s Competition:

Although no one in the US will be able to come up with a business model more profitable than Tellurian’s Driftwood. Qatar in many people’s eyes is seen as a big competitor and one that will destroy all US LNG exports but this is simply just not the case. Countries that import LNG diversify their “LNG portfolio” and will buy from a variety of countries and not just anyone in particular. No matter how profitable Qatar’s LNG plan is; Success is almost inevitable for TELL. Charif Souki personally talked about this and with utmost respect reassures us that Qatar is not a competitor. 

Stock Price📈:

Tellurian themselves have implied that the TELL stock will have a value of $12-$17 at FID! TELL is currently trading for $2.62! In the Citi Interview, Charif Souki said that the stock will have $7 FCF in a couple of years! The multiple for the FCF is decided by the market… but is usually around 10x+!🚀🚀

Institutional Owners: - https://imgur.com/a/ssYRYfP

The top 3 institutional shareholders for Tellurian are State Street Corp, Blackrock INC & Vanguard Group INC! State Street Corp recently disclosed that they added 20,783,999 shares adding to a grand total of 23,481,581 Shares. Blackrock and Vanguard own upwards of 13 million shares each! Blackrock, Vanguard, and State Street don’t invest in companies that they don’t believe in. They believe in Tellurian and have proved it with the positions they have.

Why am I invested in Tellurian🦍🦍🚀🚀?

I am invested in Tellurian because I believe in the business model and also believe in the team. Charif Souki is a very intelligent man and Tellurian’s weekly “2 minutes with Charif” videos keep investors up to date about what is going on with LNG throughout the world along with the occasional updates about Driftwood. $TELL has been through a lot these past few months but we have been setting high lows and higher highs last week which makes it appear as so we are in the “c” or correction wave according to the [Eliott Wave Theory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/elliottwavetheory.asp). The fundamentals of this company haven’t changed and things are only getting better.

TELL Positions-  [https://imgur.com/a/QjvCx4J](https://imgur.com/a/QjvCx4J)

I am long TELL as you can tell by my positions. 

**TL;DR -** Tellurian teased their agreement with South Korea earlier today and TELL is basically in a correction. The announcements of commercial agreements will help the stock reach a fair value. This is not your regular start-up company as the team has a shit ton of experience. With a highly profitable business model along with big connections in the business; Tellurian is lined up for success and is just waiting for the perfect time. Carl Icahn a short seller caused the highly respected Charif Souki to be fired from his own company and shorts are betting against his new company. It’s time to crumble the shorts. It’s time for the bulls to takeover!

Ever heard of the Grey market or Expert market?

> The Expert Market is a private market to serve broker-dealer pricing and best execution needs in securities that are restricted from public quoting or trading. Restrictions can be based on issuer requirements, security attributes, investor accreditation and/or suitability risks.

> Grey Market, ""OTC"" or ""Other OTC"" is a security that is not currently traded on the OTCQX, OTCQB or Pink markets. Broker-dealers are not willing or able to publicly quote OTC securities because of a lack of investor interest, company information availability or regulatory compliance.

Notice Grey market specifically says ""not currently traded on OTCQX, OTCQB, or PINK markets.  AND talks about no public quotes which is exactly what the rules discuss.

696,,2021-05-24 14:13:35,t3_njyxbk,,pennystocks,"CAPEX Concerns were raised after my original Due Diligence posts on **$PBT** by a few contributors in pennystocks. After originally creating a comment I realized that this comment needed to be its own post since there are a lot of factors to consider. My first 2 posts assume that we are entering a super cycle of commodities and as of Q1 2021 this has been proven by the price of WTI Crude Oil and new worldwide consumption. 

**TLDR Shortcut:** The thesis remains that markets are forward looking at oil price rise above $70 is a technical break indicator with price discovery that we have not seen in over a decade(Summer 2008). The market's bullishness towards commodities recently are reflective of inflation and oil prices specifically are on a major run as COVID exposure worldwide is decreasing. Price target remains of $17-22 through Aug.

Increased drilling costs on the Waddell Ranch properties resulting in a deficiency for the NPI. Capital expenditures for drilling, remedial and maintenance activities on the Waddell Ranch properties during the first quarter of 2021 totaled $9.5. At first glance this seems like an issue but US Shale are tight plays that require consistent drilling and fracking which was not done during the decline on 2016-2020 on the Permian Basin properties. The cumulative NPI deficit is **$7,645,016** for the underlying property (at 75%). The NPI deficit must be recovered from future proceeds of the Waddell Ranch properties prior to any other proceeds being paid to the Trust. Total Oil proceeds for Waddell reached **$12,245,665** for the first quarter of 2021. We have a current amount of unknowns such as new well production but we can make certain assumptions based on the knowledge of shale Oil that new wells have a higher production value and older wells have a declining production value. With the addition of the new wells we should see a large jump in oil production from both properties and we already have an increase in oil prices that are at a price target of $65 which is 11% higher than previous year.

Blackbeard has previously informed the Trustee that the 2021 capital expenditures budget has been approved at $88.6 million (gross) ($32.5 million net to the Trust) for the Waddell Ranch properties. The Trustee has been advised that there were **27 workover wells completed, 8 new wells completed, 8 new wells in progress and 9 workover wells in progress during the three months ended March 31, 2021**. The Waddell Ranch is being targeted for production because of the mass amount of oil rich acreage, pipeline placement, and service company ease of access to keep costs down. Texas Royalty Properties is the only producing acreage for Q1 towards the dividend but will have a declining production value while Waddell Ranch should have a massive increase in production value based on the current drilling activity. Unlike certain areas, the Permian Basin has highly proven well production based on exploration technology where all drills are producing wells thanks to fracturing technology. Also the cost of well service companies are still contributing to a lower cost to produce if you follow major service companies like baker Hughes, Halliburton, Fractech, ect..

At the end of Q1 the average per day output production was:

**Oil** 2,379 on an average price of $58.13(**Current WTI price $64.46**)

**Gas** 10,313 with an average price of $1.60(**Current Gas price $2.90**)

&#x200B;

The net profits/overriding royalty interest in the Waddell Ranch properties is the largest asset of the Trust. The mineral interests in the Waddell Ranch, from which such net royalty interests are carved, vary from 37.5% (Trust net interest) to 50% (Trust net interest) in 78,715 gross (34,205 net) producing acres. A majority of the proved reserves are attributable to six fields: Dune, Sand Hills (Judkins), Sand Hills (McKnight), Sand Hills (Tubb), University-Waddell (Devonian) and Waddell. At December 31, 2020, the Waddell Ranch properties contained 648 gross (221 net) productive oil wells, 109 gross (39 net) productive gas wells and 209 gross (67 net) injection wells. Six major fields on the Waddell Ranch properties account for more than 80% of the total production. In the six fields, there are 12 producing zones ranging in depth from 2,800 to 10,600 feet

**Directly from PBT 10-K**

>The Waddell Ranch properties are mature producing properties, and all of the major oil fields are currently being **waterflooded** for the purpose of **facilitating enhanced recovery.** Proved reserves and estimated future net revenues attributable to the properties are included in the reserve reports summarized below.

Estimated quantities of proved developed reserves of oil and gas as of the dates indicated were as follows (in thousands): 

https://preview.redd.it/smt6yvlgp2171.png?width=966&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e49591410caf24941f74df9984b1549b3ad2515

Average oil and gas prices of $65.56 per barrel and $3.11 per Mcf were used to determine the estimated future net revenues from the Waddell Ranch properties and the Texas Royalty properties, respectively, at December 31, 2018. The question raised by my previous posts is if we enter a commodities super cycle will the price of oil exceed $70 and if it does what is the underlying price of **$PBT** represented. An average price of $70 with a proven production value, not factoring in new drilling, **adds an additional $19.75M($4.44/barrel\*4450k)**. If oil prices enter a more bullish cycle similar to 2008 with reopening being complete and a roaring 20s style spending happens for the next Quarter, we could potentially see an average Oil price of $85 for a short period of time in July/Aug which is my targeted timeline and **adds an additional $86.5M($19.75/barrel \*4450k)**.  

The volume of daily shares has been suppressed for a  year which is the average shown but historically was much higher, which leads me to believe we are still early for the upside. For  example in 2008 when oil went on a large run the daily volume reached  +3M at one point. When price for oil is high and the dividend is fully  restored the average volume was around 400k/day and spikes of +1M with a  trading price of $17-22 or $6.8-8.8M/day.

If you refer to my original post, a good portion of shares are institutional or wrapped in a 1031 through a corporation. I learned  about the 1031 connection through some business associates I have in the  Permian Basin that have done this when selling their real estate and  parking the capital during down turns. I believe this will help keep a  large portion of shares locked up as the price rises since a 1031 is a  process and usually a planned event.",njyxbk,CAPEX update on $PBT expanding on previous DD (PT $17-22)

Agree with everyone that you should do your own research but yeah sometimes it doesn’t make sense at first glance.  A premarket jump can quickly drop if bag holders are looking for an exit (SPCE today), not to mention meme stocks taking over fundamentals.  Penny stocks often depart from fundamentals and are more event-driven like you mentioned, like DGLY and BLM protests.  Sometimes in penny stocks it’s all about it being new and not yet jumped.  Also, boomer books teach “rule of 72” for a target of 6% per year to double in 12 years, but if I’m up 100% after a few days then ain’t no way I’m holding for the long term (and buying after the price jump can lead to holding a loss for years as profits are taken by early investors).

As a rule, if it’s got traction on Twitter then it’s too late.  Not always true but in general keeps me safe from P&D.

Definitely check the Redditor’s account age.  I usually never trust new accounts as this group became visible to scammers in 2020 (at least on a large scale).  Again not always true, but it’s good to know post history is solid.  I have 2 Redditors I follow and believe in but neither is a crystal ball so don’t get mad if they’re wrong (again, nobody really knows).

If it’s a biopharma play I check the calendar https://www.biopharmcatalyst.com/calendars/pdufa-calendar.  Nothing like a known catalyst date to get in early on, just beware the offerings that can happen during your 1-2 month hold.  Check company’s cash on hand before investing too much, or take a small position that you add to if it dips.  Working good for me on ITRM (bought $1.16, doubled own at $0.96, and in the green with a July catalyst I’ll sell sometime in June).

If it’s an industry catalyst I Google it (Colonial Pipeline shut down made money on CPE/KMI etc.).  Also weekend news helps (Virgin Galactic news broke Saturday so we knew it was going up and I had a $22.00 limit buy that didn’t fill but sometimes these do and they usually print gains).

Also SEC forms help tbd the strategy like insider buying or predicting an offering based on cash trajectory.  https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html.

812,,2021-05-24 16:02:17,t3_nk1cla,,pennystocks,"Background: For the past few months, PPBT has been trading in a channel of 3.80 to 4.75. The company has 65 million cash on hand and currently sits at a market cap of 80 million, and will be presenting for the first time human phase 1b/2 clinical data on NT219 on 6/4 at the ASCO conference. For now, the presentation will only include monotherapy and combination therapy with cetuximab, but with preclinical humanized mouse data that looks like this: 

https://preview.redd.it/m8swwrp853171.png?width=1567&format=png&auto=webp&s=9950b44d2116f92d04729e869033c04951b88869

And having the drug already cleared as safe in humans via phase 1a, it's a fairly safe bet that the results are going to be pretty good - the above data represents results for human tumors implanted into mice. As it stands NT219 seems to have strong synergistic effects with almost any drug its paired with as it prevents drug-tumor resistance, and is a small molecule that can cross the blood brain barrier, allowing it to potentially be a part of combination therapies for traditionally hard to treat cancers as well, such as neck and brain cancer. Additionally, the lead researcher behind NT219 trials recently got an award from the American Association for Cancer Research roughly a month ago. 

&#x200B;

Technicals: The price currently sits at a price of 4.54 and has a RSI of 60.5, so it may be good to wait for a slightly better entry point - I could see a dip of going to the 4.20s in the next two weeks, but I doubt it will get back to the 3.80s with the upcoming catalyst. The company has an extremely tight share structure of 17.5m and an average float of 300,000, so if it moves it will move fast, likely a single day breakout of over 100% as seen with tickers like SYSX. IMO the smart play here is to open up a small entry position and buy as the dips come, or at the breakout past key resistance at $5.00. Since fundamentally the cash value on hand of the company is around 60m, or \~$3.80 per share, even if everything goes poorly the play has a downside of \~20%. If this starts ripping there will likely be a sell off at \~7 to get in if you're late to the party, but short term price targets of $25 (500m market cap) are fairly realistic given they potentially have IP of a highly versatile best-in-class drug that addresses unmet market needs (head and neck cancer). As a long hold, if this gets past Phase 3 this is easily a $100+ stock (2b market cap). As it stands right now, the value of the drug seems ridiculously undervalued and unpriced in, and once topline data for p1b/2 gets released a major risk factor will be removed for more investors to jump in. 

&#x200B;

Not financial advice just blasting my speculation into the void.

[Smart Mirror Product Action Shot](https://imgur.com/a/ZNJri3r)

$CAPC is a debt-free penny stock exempt company currently trading on the higher-tier OTCQB markets with audited financials and fully SEC reporting.

During last week's conference call, CEO confirmed that Smart Mirrors will begin shipping in June on Capstone's website and **will be available on Amazon.** The company confirmed that the Smart Mirror will be in big box retailers in second half of 2021. Capstone products currently sell in major retailers like Costco, Home Depot, Walmart, Target and more. It's amazon reviews for it's previous products are 5-stars. They know how to build a quality product that sells.

[Tweet from Capstone Companies, Inc.](https://twitter.com/CAPC_Capstone/status/1395793359697031174)

The number of outstanding shares is just under 50M with the company directors owning nearly half of the shares, leaving a float of 24M. Directors have never sold a share over company's history - zero dilution. In fact they added 400K worth of shares in the last couple of months in the open market with plans to buy another 750K shares through August. This company believes in the product.

This will easily appreciate in value once revenues from Smart Mirror are realized. This company is primed for growth and the corporation is already preparing for possible uplisting to NASDAQ.

Beyond this, the Smart Mirrors are just cool - people want them and the price point for $CAPC mirrors is huge for what it offers. Only $699 starting price means it is affordable for the average person, and you can mirror your phone and engage with the mirror just like you would a tablet or touch-screen PC. I think this product blows $LULU mirror out of the water as far as functionality and price point.

969,gzapdge,2021-05-24 17:50:14,t1_gzapdge,t3_njpq9i,pennystocks,I know others have pointed this out but no company opens on the market as a 0.0001 stock. All initial listings would open at a perceived value based on what they feel is a fair market price whether that is 50 cents or 200 bucks. Only though issuing of additional shares do they get diluted to the point where they end up trading as sub penny stocks. Most companies that have any value reverse split to keep that dilution down but companies that are essentially defunct shells can just keep issuing stock to make their scammy ceo's pay cheques at the expense of everyone else. You need to treat anything trading below a penny as a you would betting zero on a roulette wheel. Assume you are going to lose what you put in. Sometimes you get lucky and you hit but 000 stocks are rarely real companies and more often than not scams or dreams. (It is completely OK to put some money into these bets but don't put everything in them especially if you are trying to invest. These are not investments.),,

That's why, in order for CBDD to ever get to $1, they'd have to either have massive income/assets to justify the valuation, or, and this is the most likely scenario, consolidate shares to below or around 1 billion. There's no way in hell CBDD will be a $5 billion company anytime soon- it's already got major competition in TLRY, APHA, etc that have wider reach and better funding/income/assets.",,

The company's treatment combines the patient's own immune cells and combines them with Jadicell stem cells, which imparts stem cell attributes to them, then takes the new ""super"" immune cells and places them back in the patient. The new immune cells are smaller and more durable than stem cells so they can go more places and survive harsher environments in the body.
